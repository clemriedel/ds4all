0.09,"Many important reactions in nuclear physics cannot be measured with currently available experimental techniques. For example, the reaction probability of the process in which two protons fuse to a Deuteron (a bound state of a neutron and a proton) is an important process in the sun. However, it cannot be measured experimentally and only theoretical calculations can provide this rate. In the absence of guidance from experiment, it becomes important to quantify theoretical uncertainties. To address these issues, this project will use analytical and numerical methods to calculate reaction rates for astrophysically relevant reaction rates and new parametrizations of the internuclear interaction that will be useful to the larger nuclear physics community. Specifically, the PI and his students will use nuclear interactions constructed using effective field theory. In this theoretical approach, the nuclear interaction model can be systematically improved to improve the accuracy of the calculation. Intrinsic error of this approach will be determined using numerical techniques. This project will allow not only for a better understanding of important nuclear processes occurring in the universe, but also the project will provide a stimulating training ground for students and postdoctoral fellows and outreach community activities.<br/><br/>This project aims at improving our understanding of electroweak processes using effective field theory. A number of weak processes in few-nucleon systems will be calculated within the unified framework of 'pionless' effective field theory. Specifically, the well-measured decay half-life time of tritium will be studied theoretically in order to obtain a highly accurate description for proton-proton fusion and weak proton capture on Helium-3. Furthermore, the PI and his student will study the intrinsic error of Hamiltonians and associated electroweak currents generated in 'pionfull' effective field theory. The PI will use novel techniques to analyze uncertainties in matrix elements calculated with the chiral potential and the associated electroweak currents in order to account correctly for the intrinsic error of the Hamiltonian order-by-order. With his collaborators, the PI will then use these results to calculate observables such as half-life times or total decay rates that are currently measured to new accuracy and with correct error estimates. The resulting interactions and currents will be made available to the nuclear theory community."
0.21,"Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel, was the first to note that the number of transistors per chip roughly doubled every two years (this is called Moore's Law). The corresponding volume per transistor had to decrease exponentially with time. Miniaturization would eventually lead to such a small number of electrons per transistor that the discriminable charging effect of the electrons in a transistor fails. The point where miniaturization destroys the transistor function is known as Moore's limit. This limit is imminent within the next generation of scientists and engineers. New avenues of progress beyond current technology must be sought. This research follows the approach of quantum technology to continue the evolution of information processing beyond Moore's limit. It works to develop the necessary foundational knowledge for an approach to devices, where the behavior of these devices is governed not by the usual rules that govern the aggregate properties of a large number of particles, but by the laws of quantum mechanics, which governs electrons in the atomic limit. Specifically, this project focuses on the study of optically controlled semiconductor quantum dots. A dot effectively traps one electron, which is manipulated by ultrafast pulses of light that enable terahertz control speeds without the complexities of metal contacts. The studies emphasize the isolation of the electron from the influence of the other electrons (known as the valence electrons) and the nuclei, in particular, which constitute the dot, and the networking of the target electrons in separate dots. Light is used to excite the valence electrons to control a single target electron and to entangle two target electrons, while shielding them from the effects of nuclear fluctuations. The primary intellectual merit is based on the scientific objectives of this three-year research program; produce quantum entangled states between two electron spins separated by a large distance, demonstrate a multi-quantum-bit high-speed logic gate, and explore the feasibility of using optical control of nuclear states to store and or process information. The broader impact includes developing the basic knowledge to advance the technology of information processing beyond Moore's limit via a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative research program, training and preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers for new challenges they will be facing, and facilitating efforts by both our universities to inform and educate the public and students about the importance of this quantum research to society's well-being, including how this research is training students in STEM areas in order to maintain a competitive work force. <br/><br/>This research focuses on quantum information processing by ultrafast optical control of electron spins trapped individually in structurally defined semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Numerous advances made possible by previous NSF support, have helped meet many of the milestones of quantum operations required by the Di Vincenzo criteria. Recent advances such as demonstration of the flying qubit and nuclear spin fluctuation freezing to extend the electron-spin coherence time and creation of high optical quality laterally positioned dots are fundamental to the quantum network approach to scaling up the system. The critical discovery of nuclear spin fluctuation freezing enables lengthening the coherence time of the qubit by over 2-3 orders of magnitude for time scales lasting longer than 1 second. This allows the time for a complete sequence of computational steps with the ultrafast control including error correction. The method consists in freezing out the fluctuations of the nuclear spins unavoidably present in QDs and temporally separates the decoherence abatement from the control operations, in contrast to the common but more limited and complex method of dynamic decoupling of the qubits being processed at the same time. Building on these achievements five experimental objectives to advance the frontier of scalable quantum information processing based on optical control of the spins will be accomplished: demonstrate a two-bit controlled not-gate and of a simple algorithm using a quantum dot molecule; demonstrate teleportation of information in a single photon qubit to a QD using spontaneous parametric (singe-photon) down conversion (SPDC) to produce the single photon source; produce an entangled state between a quantum dot spin and a spontaneously emitted photon (at 960nm) and convert it to the telecom wavelength around 1.55 microns; demonstrate heralded entanglement of two QD spins using photons.; and extend the work on nuclear spin fluctuation freezing to using optically detected NMR to more completely understand the underlying physics state of nuclei in the dot. <br/><br/>The work is an interdisciplinary research effort in the physics of semiconductor nano-structures, high-precision coherent optical control, and spectroscopy of QDs. These studies are paralleled by the coherent transient time domain studies consistent with device applications and scalable architectures. The amelioration of the environmental problem (decoherence) lies in the coordinated theoretical and experimental treatment of the quantum correlated dynamics of the optically controlled electron spin and the nuclear spins in the QD through the hyperfine interaction without additional stochastic assumptions.The intellectual merit arises from the increasingly sophisticated understanding of the interaction effects between a microscopic system (the electron spins as the qubits) and a macroscopic system (the dot environment, control or measurement) within quantum theory. The broad bandwidth control of the quantum physics makes the QD system the high speed processing unit partner to the quantum memory device of trapped ions. The operating temperature of 4-10 K is above the milli-K required by gated dots and superconducting circuits and optical control avoids some of the connection problems.<br/><br/>The broader impact is first in the development of highly trained people critical to the infrastructure of quantum technology, at all levels of higher education: postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students. The second broader impact is that the optical approach positions our research to play a key role in the transition from the electronic devices that currently drive the Moore?s law to the new paradigm of post CMOS era. The further miniaturization of the current devices that process classical information will reach the quantum barrier where devices operating on quantum information will take over. The future lies in a hybrid structure of classical devices for interface with human and quantum devices for information processing. The optical approach to quantum devices, based on the established III-V material with a large industrial infrastructure and optical sources and gating based on telecom technology, may provide a smooth transition to the hybrid structure."
4.655,"This award funds a broad program of measurements in nuclear physics by faculty and students at Florida State University (FSU). The experiments include studies of nuclear reactions and decays that play key roles in all stages of stellar processes. This aspect of the program supports the large investment made and being made in astronomical observations worldwide. Other experiments focus on the evolution of nuclear shell structure with increasing neutron number, especially near the magic numbers of 20 and 28. The behavior of nuclei at ultra-high spin will be explored through discrete gamma spectroscopy using arrays of gamma detectors at FSU and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The group will also exploit heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to investigate the characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma. The broader societal impacts of this project lie in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in a hands-on environment. Florida State University has served as one of the leading educators in the field of nuclear physics (4th highest Ph.D. production in the U.S.) and this grant will enable the group to continue to attract and train the best and brightest graduate students in experimental nuclear physics. Because of the students' training and hands-on work with high tech equipment in a forefront nuclear physics laboratory, FSU graduates are in high demand and now serve in key roles in homeland security, national defense, high-tech industry, leading edge research, and STEM education. Finally, these measurements will be important for understanding stellar processes and the abundance of elements in our universe. <br/><br/>A significant part of the proposed research uses short-lived rare nuclear isotopes from the FSU Fox Laboratory to study nuclear reactions and structure in unstable nuclei. This is very important for reactions of astrophysical importance, many of which proceed through unstable nuclei. These beams have low intensity and so will benefit from the ANASEN active target and detector array recently developed by FSU in collaboration with Louisiana State University. A newly developed neutron detector array (RESONEUT) will be used to study (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics with radioactive beams. A series of experiments is planned to measure the critical parameter of lifetime following beta decay of heavy, neutron-rich nuclei on and close to the expected r-process path at TRIUMF. The confrontation of state-of-the-art shell model calculations for multiple cross-shell excitations with proposed nuclear structure measurements will strengthen their reliability for extrapolation to the astrophysically important region. The FSU 14C beam will be used to explore nuclear structure in more neutron-rich nuclei with a recently digitized Germanium detector array. Measurements using gamma detector arrays (GRETINA and GAMMASPHERE) will explore newly proposed exotic shapes and ultra-high-spin structures in the atomic mass ~ 150 region. Other work involves studying the quark-gluon plasma with heavy flavor probes using the PHENIX detector system, parts of which were constructed at FSU. In this instance the FSU focus is on the effects of cold nuclear matter on heavy quarkonia production."
0.56,"The formation of a complex organism from a single cell, the fertilized egg, requires the expression of different genes at different times and in different cells as the embryo develops. Many of the gene products controlling these early steps in development determine cell fate through their function as regulatory genes, encoding transcription factors or signaling proteins that regulate the expression of downstream cascades of genes encoding products directly involved in growth and differentiation of different cell types. If these regulatory genes are active in the wrong cells at the wrong time, it is catastrophic for the embryo, which will likely die as a result of this mis-expression. The goal of this project is to unravel the mechanisms controlling the activity of embryonic regulatory genes. It will use a well-established animal model, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, for these studies. The focus is on one family of embryonic transcription factors, a nuclear receptor, which is regulated by interactions with protein partners. Findings will provide a fundamental model for studies of other members of the nuclear receptor family, in Drosophila and other species, by contributing to an understanding of cell type specification during embryonic development and elucidating different levels at which the function of transcription factors is regulated to produce unique cell types. This proposal will train students from diverse backgrounds in the laboratory in bench science, critical thinking and scientific presentation. In addition, it will support formal collaborations with a majority minority middle school in Maryland(Wilde Lake Middle School)to bolster the genetics curriculum for 7th graders and with the MARC program at Northeastern Illinois University that will send up to two students/year for summer internships to Northwestern. These efforts are part of ongoing efforts on the part of both the PI and Co-PI to educate the public about science. <br/><br/> Nuclear Receptors (NRs) are a large family of transcription factors that control a broad range of biological processes. Although the activity of many NRs is regulated by ligand, a large number of these receptors are orphan NRs that share a common fold with NRs with known ligands. This likely reflects the ancestral state of this protein family. How is the activity of orphan NRs regulated? Drosophila Ftz-F1 is the founding member of the NR5A nuclear receptor family. In previous work, the Principle Investigator and colleagues showed that Drosophila Ftz-F1 interacts with the homeodomain protein Ftz, a classic pair-rule protein expressed in seven stripes in embryos in the primordia of body regions missing in ftz mutant animals. Ftz-F1 and Ftz form a stable complex in vivo and bind to composite DNA sites, synergistically activating target gene expression. Thus, although Ftz-F1 is a strong transcriptional activator alone in vitro, and it is present in the nuclei of all somatic cells of the embryo, its activity is limited to the cells in which Ftz is also expressed (Ftz+ cells). These studies demonstrate that protein-protein interactions modulate Ftz-F1 activity and provide an in vivo model system to dissect the mechanisms underlying this regulation. Here we will test whether Ftz-F1 is regulated: (1) at the level of DNA binding; (2) by a corepressor/coactivator exchange, and/or (3) by Ftz-induced conformational change. This work will combine biochemical and structural methods with molecular genetic approaches in Drosophila embryos to evaluate the contributions of each of these mechanisms to the regulation of NR activity in vivo. It will train postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics and, most importantly, critical thinking: generating, testing and evaluating hypotheses."

0.599932,"The development of new connections between neuronal cells in the brain is a critical process which ultimately underlies our ability to learn and remember. This proposal focuses on a newly-discovered process called Nuclear Envelope Budding (NEB) that allows cells to make targeted changes to the structure of their connections with other cells. Three sets of experiments will be carried out, examining (1) molecular changes that underlie NEB, (2) the mechanical means through which NEB is accomplished, and (3) how NEB actually functions in newly-developing cell-to-cell connections. An exciting and novel aspect of this latter set of experiments is the use of live cell microscopy to document the development of new connections in real time as they form in a living organism. These studies will provide novel and critical insights into how the brain develops and into how our experiences can lead to changes in our neuronal circuitry.<br/><br/>This proposal takes advantage of the well-established Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) model of synapse outgrowth and maturation to further our understanding of how RNA granules are formed and subsequently trafficked to synaptic sites during development. In particular, these studies will focus on the recently described process of Nuclear Envelope Budding (NEB), a nuclear export pathway by which RNA granules that contain postsynaptic transcripts are released from postsynaptic muscle nuclei. In Aim 1, we will investigate how Pin1, a highly conserved enzyme, functions to regulate NEB via nuclear lamina remodeling. In Aim 2, we will explore the role of a non-canonical Nuclear Pore Complex that we hypothesize loads mRNA transcripts into RNA granules forming at the periphery of the nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3, we will take advantage of a new tool to image trafficking dynamics of RNA granules in postsynaptic muscles at the time of synaptogenesis. This proposal utilizes high resolution imaging modalities including array tomography, immunogold EM and live cell imaging. These approaches, combined with the genetic tractability of the in vivo system, poise this study to make a significant contribution to our understanding of RNA granule biology and provide exciting new mechanistic insight into the bidirectional communication that occurs between the nucleus and the forming synapse during NMJ development."
0.512545,"The Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Kurt Zilm of Yale University to develop new nuclear magnetic resonance methods for investigation of the chemistry, dynamics and structures of biomolecules. The research will use relaxation methods to identify how structure is related to the dispersion in internal protein and water motions, and to obtain distances in biologically relevant macromolecular complexes. To extend solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance to more complex and size limited samples, new instruments will be developed with 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher specific sensitivity. These will combine paramagnetic condensed acquisition with very fast cryogenic magic angle sample spinning, as well as microliter sample size dynamic nuclear polarization hardware. When developed, these capabilities will be applied to characterize mutant visual pigments and functionally distinct isoforms of prion protein oligomers. Currently, these are samples where obtaining nuclear magnetic resonance data is impractical on sub-microliter samples. <br/><br/>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-known diagnostic tool in medicine that uses nuclear spin information, often in water, to distinguish different types of tissue in the body. The study of nuclear spin properties of water in proteins is directly related to understanding and improving contrast in MRI technology. This research involves fundamental studies of the distribution of water in proteins, knowledge from which will help improve the sensitivity and the spatial resolution of MRI experiments. The research program also encourages under-represented minorities to enter science careers through involvement in the public education program ""Science on Saturdays,"" a series of scientific lectures and hands-on demonstrations attended by up to 300 members of the public at a time."
0.57,"This award supports a nuclear physics experimental project at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. The goal of the experiment is a better understanding of the internal quark and gluon structure of the proton and neutron constituents of nuclear matter. The proposed research will provide fundamental information on the momentum distributions of the quarks inside the nucleons of the helium-3 and tritium atoms, using a new method of comparing directly measurements of inelastic electron scattering from helium-3 and tritium nuclei. This method is complementary to experiments done in the past at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which showed the existence of point-like ""partons"" inside the nucleons, by scattering electrons from hydrogen and deuterium nuclei. The new method will eliminate inherent theoretical uncertainties in the Stanford method. The results will test long-standing predictions of the Quark Model of the nucleon, and of Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory describing the interactions between quarks and gluons. In addition, a new proposal will be prepared for a measurement of elastic electron scattering from the tritium nucleus, which will provide critical information for the development of a ""standard model"" describing the structure and dynamics of the simplest, lightest nuclei in nature. The project is expected to make significant contributions to the advancement of basic nuclear physics science, and to graduate education and training by offering doctoral dissertation topics on related science and instrumentation, which provide experience needed for careers in education, medical physics, homeland security, high technology, and national laboratories research.<br/><br/>The project will make use of a tritium, helium-3, and deuterium target system under development at Jefferson Lab, and magnetic spectrometers in the Hall A facility of the Lab. Unpolarized electrons with energy up to 11 gigaelectronvolt will be scattered from the above nuclear targets. For the inelastic measurements, scattered electrons will be detected with the electron High Resolution Spectrometer and a refurbished BigBite Spectrometer. The ratio of the measured cross sections for tritium and helium-3 will determine reliably the ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions, and subsequently the ratio of the probability distributions for an up quark compared to a down quark in the nucleon. The ratio of the tritium and helium-3 cross sections to the deuterium cross section will provide additional information about the effect of the nuclear environment on quarks in the nucleon. A comparison of the effect for these two mirror nuclei is considered to be essential for a full explanation of this effect. For the elastic measurements, the hadron High Resolution Spectrometer will be also used for detection of tritium recoiling nuclei. The two tritium form factors will be measured up to large momentum transfers by means of a Rosenbluth separation. This group will play a major role in all aspects of the project, namely the i) refurbishment, checkout, and calibration of the BigBite spectrometer, ii) preparation of all experimental apparatuses to be used, iii) acquisition of the experimental data, iv) data analysis, and v) publication of the results. The graduate students involved will be exposed to and gain expertise with both hardware and software development."
0.375,"This research project has the overall goal of increasing our knowledge of nuclear systems both finite (nuclei) and infinite. Particular emphasis is placed on the physics of nuclei with large neutron or proton excess with the intent to provide theoretical support and predictions for experiments at rare isotope facilities, including the new generation at RIKEN Tokyo, GSI Darmstadt, and NSCL/MSU East Lansing. Because most experiments at such facilities employ strongly interacting probes, an improved analysis of such reactions is proposed in order to extract new physics. The serious discrepancies between heavy-ion knockout and transfer reactions make the continued development of this framework urgent. The tool for this research project is the dispersive optical model, based on the Green's function method, which provides a bridge between nuclear reactions and nuclear structure information. Ab initio microscopic calculations of heavier and exotic nuclei are proposed based on the Fadeev random phase approximation (FRPA) formulation of the self-consistent Green's function method. This many-body approach appears to be one of the most promising strategies to deal with medium and heavy nuclei for the calculation of the ground state as well as spectroscopic data. The proposal also outlines concrete steps to clarify the phase diagram of nuclear matter around saturation density, as a function of density, temperature and nucleon asymmetry. <br/><br/>The research aims to raise the standard of the analysis of nuclear reactions and is intended to have a significant impact on the experimental program at facilities like the planned Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). The ab initio FRPA method practiced in the group provides interdisciplinary links with other fields and involves international collaborations with institutions in England, Japan, Spain, and Belgium. The continued exposure of graduate students and young scientists all over the world to the many-body theory book of the PI fosters improved understanding of exciting new phenomena in nuclear physics in other disciplines. The mentoring of graduate assistants and post-doctoral associates in the process and ethic of scientific research is an integral part of the project. Their development toward independence as original and productive scientists is a central objective of the program and will continue to prepare them for industry or academic institutions."
0.35,"Neutron capture in stars leading to the formation of heavy elements, as well as nucleon induced fission, are at the forefront of nuclear physics research. Because the neutron lacks charge, reactions with free neutrons are very difficult, and popular tools such as deuteron stripping (d,p) reactions are often used instead. The neutron inside the deuteron is bound and its energy, momentum, and angular momentum do not directly relate to the same quantities for a free neutron. Hence, the development of advanced (d,p) theory is critical for the success of many experimental programs at existing and future radioactive beam facilities. The overarching objective of this project is to advance the theory of deuteron stripping reactions leading to bound states and resonances, providing reliable connections between (d,p) reaction cross sections and the corresponding (direct or resonant) neutron capture cross sections on unstable nuclei. In this project the investigators will develop publicly available computer codes that will aid in the interpretation of low-energy experiments at radioactive beam facilities.<br/><br/>Simple transfer reactions such as deuteron stripping (d,p) reactions carry many of the basic features of rearrangement reactions induced by heavier nuclei. They provide a unique tool for extracting nuclear information for neutron capture identified as one of the crucial inputs needed for nuclear astrophysics and applied physics studies, such as in advanced fuel cycles, nuclear energy and nuclear safety applications, and nuclear stockpile stewardship. Advanced reaction theory is the key to connecting (d,p) cross sections to neutron capture cross sections. This project is devoted to advancing low-energy reaction theory. The investigators will focus on obtaining accurate solutions of the generalized three-body Faddeev integral equations including explicitly the Coulomb interaction between nuclei. This project will provide training opportunities for students, who will have the chance to work on cutting-edge theoretical and computational developments of great importance for the future of nuclear physics."
0.44,"While typical nuclear excitation energies are in the keV to MeV range, there are several exceptional cases where the excitation energies are much lower. The subject of this project is the thorium-229 isotope, which, uniquely, has an excited state in the UV optical spectrum. Several experimental searches for optical emission in this range undertaken in the past ten years were unsuccessful or inconclusive. In addition to searching in the wrong energy region, the searches were challenged by the narrow linewidth of the nuclear transition. In this work, an alternative electron-bridge transition will be employed for the initial laser excitation of the nuclear isomer level in thorium-229. The nuclear transition is likely to be exceptionally sensitive to the variation of fundamental constants, due to the interplay of the strong and electroweak interactions inside this nucleus. After the isomer level is found, the sensitivity of the nuclear transition to time variation of the fine structure constant will be determined.<br/><br/>This research will have broad impact across several areas of physics and technology. Laser excitation and coherent manipulation of nuclear states would establish a new bridge between atomic and nuclear physics, with the promise of new levels of accuracy for frequency metrology. The project will involve extensive graduate and undergraduate student training and participation."
0.45,"0954360<br/>Yun<br/><br/>Once considered a promising field of biomedical research, the enthusiasm for gene therapy has been tempered by the near lack of clinical successes and by the potential toxicity associated with viral gene carriers. Non-viral gene therapies are safer alternatives, but their effectiveness has been limited by a low expression of therapeutic proteins. Although many cellular barriers to transporting DNA into the cell's cytoplasm have been surmounted with the advancement of non-viral gene therapy, a major challenge that has impeded its usefulness for clinical applications is the shuttling of DNA from the cytoplasm, through the nuclear pores, and into the nucleus. Overall, this mechanism is poorly understood, and the coupling of an active shuttling agent, such as a nuclear localization signal, with DNA has yielded inconsistent and disputable results. These outcomes could possibly be attributed to the complexing of a positively charged polymer, such as linear polyethylenimine, to DNA (DNA complex) that has been previously coupled with a nuclear localization signal in order to facilitate the transport of DNA into the cell's cytoplasm. While the linear polyethylenimine is vital for the initial stages of gene delivery, it may impede the nuclear penetration since most DNA complexes are too large to fit into the nuclear pores, which are approximately 20 nanometers in diameter. Thus, the goal of this CAREER proposal is to investigate the relationship of nuclear entry with the structural morphologies and the dimensions of DNA complexes. Previous studies have not addressed this topic and have therefore missed an important opportunity to improve the efficacy of non-viral gene therapy. DNA complexes have been shown to form a variety of structures, including rod, toroid, and globular conformations. Since most toroid and globular conformations of DNA complexes are larger than 20 nanometers, it is hypothesized that they are limited in their ability to gain entry into the nucleus through the nuclear pores. Thus, this proposal involves the nanoscale engineering of DNA complexes in order to control their sizes and/or to direct their structural conformations into rods using different complexing processes. Resolving this problem could be the transformative breakthrough that accelerates the field of non-viral gene therapy from basic research to clinical applications. If successful, non-viral delivery systems could be as effective as viruses. <br/><br/>The educational activities include the integration of research with teaching at all educational levels, recruitment of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to local high schools. The key components of this plan are indentifying and recruiting K-12 students that are the first generation in their family to attend college and are under-represented in the field of biomedical engineering. Since these students will be recruited from economically depressed areas of Northeast Ohio, the summer mentoring program includes paid research positions that are designed to enhance the student's prospects for college acceptance and to help their competition for scholarships. In addition, high school teachers will also be recruited to conduct research. Ideally, these teachers will be paired with their own students to form the basis of a research team that will also include graduate and undergraduate students that are funded by this award. The graduate students will undergo engineering and leadership training and will be given opportunities in the mentorship of both K-12 and undergraduate students. This proposal also seeks to enhance the broader impact activities by the distribution of educational materials and by the development of a graduate level course that is designed specifically for high school teachers. It is hoped that the proposed educational activities would foster interest in students that have never considered biomedical engineering as a viable career path."
0.5,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Radiation-tolerant materials can extend the lifetime of components, and may be very valuable in the design and operation of safer, more reliable nuclear systems - where controlling radiation is a top priority. The atomic-level understanding of radiation interaction is critical for developing advanced materials that can withstand intensive radiation for both current and future nuclear technologies. This CAREER project targets the fundamental understanding of the behavior of nanostructured ceramics under extreme radiation environments. This fundamental knowledge may enable new science for nanoscale materials design that extends the performance of materials with excellent radiation tolerance. The research effort is complemented by an integrated education component which will impact the scientific community by bridging advanced materials and nanotechnology with nuclear education and training of young scientists in the critical area of controlling radiation. Special efforts will be made to involve underrepresented groups of high-school students and teachers through collaborations with local communities (Half Hollow Hills school district, NY) and academic outreach programs (including Summer@Rensselaer). This approach will help promote the general public's understanding of nuclear radiation (both the challenges and materials solutions).<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This CAREER project aims to elucidate atomistic mechanisms of radiation interaction and defect behaviors in order to understand the damage mechanisms and structural evolution of nanostructured ceramics and how different length scales affect materials radiation performance. This research builds on a synergetic effort of synthesizing nanostructured ceramics, energetic beam irradiation and the combination of state-of-the-art approaches (including advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ion beam techniques) in characterizing materials structural evolution and defect behaviors. High-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry is being performed on nanostructured ceramics in order to correlate the thermodynamic understanding with radiation stability. The atomistic mechanisms of radiation interaction with nanostructured ceramics alongside multi-scale computational simulations based on DFT, classical molecular dynamic (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) are being used to determine how nanostructure evolves upon radiation. Based on an improved fundamental understanding, new science is evolving to develop advanced materials with enhanced radiation tolerance for effective radiation control through nanoscale materials design."
0.925809,"Intellectual merit: Chromosome organization and chromatin dynamics play important roles in nuclear processes such as gene regulation. However, understanding of most mechanisms that link nuclear organization to function remains rudimentary. Chromatin domain insulators (also called boundary elements) might link gene regulation to nuclear organization. Insulators are thought to partition chromosomes into functionally independent domains, preventing cross-talk so that genes in adjacent domains can be differentially regulated. But little is known about molecular mechanisms by which insulators function. The goal of this research project is to gain insight into molecular mechanisms by focusing on a particular insulator-binding protein in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies), the Boundary Element-Associated Factor, BEAF. Various approaches will be used to identify important domains in BEAF, and to identify proteins that interact with BEAF. The relationship of these proteins to BEAF will then be characterized. Previous results from the laboratory of the PI found that BEAF usually binds adjacent to promoters and plays a role in keeping the associated promoters active. Experiments will be performed to determine if promoter activity correlates with BEAF-dependent insulator activity, and to determine if interacting proteins affect BEAF-associated promoter activity. Some models of insulator function hypothesize that insulators are involved in nuclear organization by mediating the formation of chromatin loops. There is evidence that BEAF mediates chromatin loop formation. To explore this in more depth, networks of looping interactions will be determined for six BEAF binding regions using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) assays with high throughput DNA sequencing. The proportion of loop partners that are insulators, promoters, enhancers, or other sequences will be determined, as will the distances over which looping occurs. Results will be validated by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays. Identification of interaction partners of BEAF and the role of BEAF and these proteins in promoter activity will provide insight into molecular mechanisms of insulator function. The looping experiments address the role of insulators in nuclear organization. Together, these experiments will provide insight into the relationship between nuclear organization and gene regulation. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: An integral goal of research in the lab of the PI is to train the next generation of scientists. Participants in this research project will include both graduate and undergraduate students, including members of traditionally underrepresented groups. At least two undergraduates usually work in the lab each semester and in the summer. They participate in cloning, PCR (mutagenesis, sequencing, inverse PCR to localize transgene insertion sites), fly genetics, microscopy, and protein biochemistry. Most have been females, minorities or both. Several have gone on to careers in medicine or life sciences research. The PI has also served as a local Science Fair judge, mentored two high school science fair projects, and is recruiting another high school student. One project won second place in its category in statewide competition. PhD students and associated undergraduates will be trained during this project. The research will enhance teaching by the PI of junior and senior level molecular cell biology courses, and of a graduate seminar course entitled Chromatin, Nuclear Organization and Gene Expression developed by the PI based on his research expertise. Research results will be disseminated at conferences and by publication. The PI will continue to make reagents developed in his laboratory, such as fly stocks, available to the research community. Thus this research will have significant scientific and educational impacts."
0.203,"This Major Research Instrumentation award will enable the installation of a large acceptance, high-resolution magnetic spectrograph at the John D. Fox Accelerator Laboratory of Florida State University (FSU) and the development of a suite of state-of-the-art auxiliary detectors around it. This instrument will allow precision measurements of certain nuclear properties, which determine the energy release and time scale of stellar explosions and studies of the physics of unbound atomic nuclei in general. This instrument reclaims the capability to perform such precision measurements in the USA. <br/><br/>This collaborative MRI award will fund the installation of a large-acceptance, high-resolution Enge split-pole spectrograph (SPS) at the accelerator laboratory at FSU with the purpose of studying the physics of resonant nuclear states that impact nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure. The SPS became available upon the cessation of operations at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University. This project will install the 32-tonne instrument at FSU and augment its research capabilities by upgrading its focal plane detectors and developing a new Silicon detector array, in parallel at Louisiana State University (LSU), for efficient spectroscopy of unbound resonances.<br/><br/>The properties of un-bound nuclear states, or resonances, have become a focal point of present day nuclear science as they present the doorway through which stars and stellar explosions build up the elements and release energy. The LSU/FSU collaboration previously developed the Array for Nuclear Astrophysics and Structure with Exotic Beams (ANASEN) for high-efficiency studies of such reactions using beams of radioactive nuclei. A new opportunity for advancing our understanding of nuclear reactions with astrophysical importance stems from the unique combination of high-precision spectroscopy performed with the SPS with the existing program of high-sensitivity studies with radioactive beams currently being performed with ANASEN.<br/><br/>The proposed SPS system also creates an important discovery potential for the physics of exotic nuclear states, studied through a systematic investigation of particle orbitals beyond the binding limit. The interaction of nuclear orbits across shell closures is of importance to the physics of exotic nuclei at the limits of binding. The modification of nuclear properties through the presence of extended wavefunctions will be studied through a detailed spectroscopy of un-bound resonances, studying the presence of the Super-radiance mechanism in the presence of competing particle-decay channels. Again, the research at the SPS is not only complementary, but important to current and future studies with radioactive beams at FSU and the future Facility for Rare isotope Beams (FRIB).<br/><br/>The proposed program around the SPS is a complementary effort and aims to address a lack of experimental opportunities with stable nuclear beams within the U.S. scientific program. Operated by a collaboration of two vibrant research groups, the SPS has the potential to become a national resource in the education of the next generation of scientists."
0.39,"Experimental nuclear physics helps us to understand the properties of the nuclei at the center of atoms and how the elements are synthesized in stars and their explosions. This project enhances our understanding of these fundamental questions by accelerating nuclei to high energies and measuring gamma and charged particle radiation that is emitted when they interact with other atomic nuclei. The focus is on accelerating beams of atomic nuclei that are unstable to beta decay, living for times as short as seconds. The interactions between atomic nuclei informs our understanding of the properties of atomic nuclei, especially those far from stability that are more weakly bound, as well as helping us to understand how the parents of the stable elements were synthesized. The project exploits state-of-the-art instruments and accelerator facilities in the U.S. Central to this effort is enhancing the education of students and postdoctoral scholars and preparing them for careers in education and fundamental and applied research. The nuclear physics results from this project are also of importance in astronomy, to understand the abundance of elements observed in the cosmos, and for nuclear energy and national security, to understand properties of and reactions on fragments from fission of actinides. To expand the reach of this project, the principal investigator presents workshops to undergraduate students on how to prepare for graduate studies and gives lectures to the public and schools on this research.<br/><br/>One of the frontier areas of nuclear physics is the study of the structure of atomic nuclei far from the valley of stability. In atomic nuclei the single-particle orbitals are expected to change as a function of neutron and proton number, and in addition are very sensitive to the presence of deformation. Single-particle characteristics can be probed in single-particle transfer reactions. Light-ion transfer reactions will be studied with beam energies near the Coulomb barrier and about 35-MeV per nucleon. Studies will concentrate on neutron-rich nuclei near the N=50 neutron shell closure, accelerated fragments following fission of 252Cf and light nuclei important for understanding the synthesis of nuclei in stars and their explosions. These studies will be carried out with accelerated beams of rare isotopes at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University and the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory. The NSCL focus is to extract spectroscopic strengths with reduced dependence on theoretical model parameters. At ATLAS the group will exploit Gammasphere-ORRUBA: Dual Detectors for Nuclear Structure Studies to probe the fragmentation of single-particle strength with coincidence measurements between charged particles (measured with ORRUBA, the Oak Ridge Rutgers University Barrel Array of position-sensitive silicon strip detectors) and gamma rays (measured with Gammasphere, the array of 110 Compton-suppressed Ge gamma-ray detectors). The group will also further develop capabilities to measure particle-gamma-ray coincidences with scintillator detectors coupled to ORRUBA."
0.279923,"The neutron is a key building block of ordinary matter, but when freed from the confines of an atom the neutron is unstable and decays into other elementary particles: a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino (a lightweight neutral particle), with an average lifetime of about 15 minutes. Neutron decay is a useful laboratory for studying details of the force responsible - the weak nuclear force - one of the four fundamental forces of nature. This award will support an experiment in which beams of free neutrons pass through specialized detectors that precisely measure the neutron decay lifetime and the angles between the emitted particles. From these results the scientists can test and refine the theory of the weak nuclear force and better understand the physics of the sun, stars, the Big Bang, and important nuclear reactions. This work, at the ""precision frontier"" of particle and nuclear physics, complements research at the ""high energy frontier"", for example at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe. This project is also an excellent opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students in the general methods and theory of neutron science that are applicable to diverse fields in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology research at major neutron sources around the world.<br/><br/>The beta decay of the free neutron is the prototype semileptonic weak interaction and simplest nuclear beta decay. There are no complications from nuclear structure, and the decay energy is small compared to the nucleon mass so recoil-order weak form factors enter below the 0.1% level. Therefore neutron decay is an attractive system for precise low energy weak interaction measurements. The neutron lifetime establishes the time scale and temperature of nucleon ""freeze out"" shortly after the Big Bang, which sets the neutron to proton ratio during the era of primordial nucleosynthesis and hence the helium abundance, and indirectly constrains the effective number of light neutrinos. The electron-antineutrino correlation ""a"" gives lambda, the ratio of axial vector (GA) and vector (GV) weak nucleon couplings. With the neutron lifetime it can be used to determine Vud, the first element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, and constrain new physics beyond the Standard Model such as weak scalar and tensor forces. The present experimental situations with both the neutron lifetime and lambda are unsatisfactory, there is relatively poor agreement among previous measurements. The proposed program consists of three projects: 1) A continuation of the aCORN experiment at the NIST Center for Neutron Research toward an ultimate goal of measuring ""a"" to < 0.5% uncertainty (a factor of 10 improvement); 2) a phased program to improve the neutron lifetime measurement using the beam method; and 3) development of a 3He gas scintillation absolute neutron flux counter to support the neutron lifetime program."
6.575,"This award provides support for the Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL) at the University of Notre Dame for an experimental program in low energy nuclear physics. The program is primarily focused on critical issues in nuclear astrophysics, addressing questions about fusion reactions in stars and stellar explosions, how they produce the energy that is released and how they build up all the elements that are observed in our universe. A broad experimental agenda is planned to measure these reactions in the NSL laboratory using a number of different experimental techniques and accelerators. Nuclear reactions that drive stellar explosions will also be studied at larger scale laboratories that can provide rare ion beams that are not available at the NSL facilities. These efforts will primarily take place at Argonne National Laboratory and at the National Super Conducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. <br/><br/>The second mission of the laboratory is the study of the structure of the nucleus. Here the planned experiments focus on measuring the behavior and characteristics of nuclear matter, ranging from mapping special vibrational modes to the incompressibility of matter. These measurements will primarily be done at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics in Osaka, Japan, since no comparable US facility is presently available. <br/><br/>The third goal of this work is to further develop a broad program of nuclear science applications by focusing on high sensitivity methods such as Accelerator Mass Spectrometry and x- and gamma ray spectroscopy. These techniques benefit a broad array of academic fields, including astrophysics, geology, biology, archaeology, and history. Finally, the research provides a rich, hands-on environment for training undergraduate and graduate students in nuclear science, who will then have skills applicable to homeland security and other critical areas."
0.25499,"Massive Stars, like Betelgeuse in the Constellation Orion, end their lives as a core-collapse supernova. These powerful explosions mark the birth of a neutron star and spread a wave of ejecta, including a wealth of newly-made chemical elements, into the galaxy. Many of the elements that make up ourselves and our planet were produced in past supernova explosions. The modern understanding of the supernova explosion highlights highly turbulent ejecta heated by neutrinos that are escaping from the newborn neutron star. This project will study these explosions and their ejecta with a focus on i) how the nuclear physics aspects that determine the structure of the newborn neutron star influences the supernova explosion, and ii) how the developing highly turbulent, neutrino-driven dynamics of the supernova influences the production of chemical elements by the explosion. These tasks will provide excellent training grounds for graduate students in theoretical nuclear physics and computational physics.<br/><br/>The investigators and their students will use the CHIMERA neutrino radiation hydrodynamic code to perform two and three dimensional simulations of the supernova explosions for a number of star masses. In order to investigate the impact of the nuclear physics of the neutron star on the explosion, models using a series of nuclear equations of state will be explored. This study will reveal the physical regimes where the nuclear equation of state has the most influence on the supernova explosions. In order to investigate the nucleosynthesis of core-collapse supernovae, the investigators will utilize post-processing analysis (via tracer particles and a large nuclear reaction network) to explore the full nucleosynthesis impact of a range of models. This will be abetted by additional simulations that include larger, more realistic nuclear reaction networks within the CHIMERA simulations. Together, these models are expected to provide the most realistic simulation to date of the elemental and isotopic production of core-collapse supernovae."
0.288119,"Non-Technical<br/>Electrons are fundamental particles that have spin, mass, and charge. The understanding of electronic energy levels has been crucial to understanding chemistry and the development of solid-state materials, such as semiconductors, which have enabled technologies such as computer chips, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. The logic elements in today's computer chips rely on controlling electron charge and encode information as the presence or absence of charge currents and voltages, but encoding information using electron spin polarization has applications for quantum information processing and potential advantages for improving the speed, efficiency, and energy consumption of logic devices. Electron spins, however, also interact with nuclear spins, and this can be an undesirable source of noise or, if we can understand it better, a pathway for controlling electron spin polarization. The PI will use optical measurements with pulsed lasers to characterize how these spin interactions depend on material strain and other parameters. This research will improve the scientific understanding of these interactions and help us figure out how to control them. The results of this research have the potential to advance multiple scientific and technological areas, including semiconductor physics, device engineering, materials science, magnetism and quantum information. The research will provide valuable training to student researchers in a wide range of techniques, including semiconductor device design and fabrication, optical and electrical measurements, data acquisition and analysis and communicating results through scientific presentations and publications. The proposed outreach and education activities will seek to increase public engagement with recent developments in science and technology and to encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific careers.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>The proposed research will investigate electron and nuclear spin interactions in low-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures. Controlling the interactions between electron and nuclear spins is of great importance for applications such as classical and quantum information processing, but the understanding of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system is incomplete. Recent experiments on strained quantum dots have revealed unexpected phenomena, including nuclear spin locking, nuclear magnetization at zero magnetic field, and the anomalous Hanle effect. These phenomena have been variously attributed to the effects of quantum confinement, mesoscopic size, and strain, but it is difficult to separate these effects in quantum dots and establish the underlying physical mechanisms. The proposed measurements on strained and unstrained quantum wells will elucidate the role of quantum confinement, carrier localization, reduced symmetry and dimensionality, and spin-orbit effects on electron-nuclear spin interactions. The nuclear polarization will be monitored using ultrafast pump-probe and spin noise optical techniques capable of sensitively measuring small changes to the nuclear spin polarization. The proposed research will advance scientific understanding of the physical origins of recently-observed phenomena in strained quantum dots and address open questions about the coupled electron-nuclear spin system and its interaction with light."
0.019485,"Genetic studies across species frequently uncover conflicting patterns between the nuclear and organellar (including mitochondria) genomes. Contrasting patterns of genomic divergence can potentially be explained by differences related to inheritance, gene flow, and mutation rate, but it is unknown how co-evolutionary interactions between these genomes influence genetic divergence. Using Dusky Salamanders and revolutionary DNA sequencing technologies, evolutionary patterns of divergence will be compared between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, with a focus on nuclear genes that function within the mitochondrion. Dusky salamanders are an excellent system for this project because they are regionally diverse in eastern North America and have demonstrated gene flow across species boundaries. These criteria, and the growing genetic resources available for salamanders, make them an excellent system to test for conflicting evolutionary patterns between nuclear and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes.<br/><br/>This research will contribute toward graduate student training in the use of rapidly changing and advancing genetic technologies and help preparations for an academic career through peer-reviewed research and undergraduate mentorship. Results from this study will provide new insights into how researchers should use genomic data to reconstruct the Tree of Life, and will contribute to an understanding of the processes that influence genetic divergence and speciation."
0.2,"This project will use theoretical methods to explore some of the fundamental questions at the interface of nuclear science with astrophysics and high-energy physics. These questions include where and how elements from deuterium to uranium are made in the Universe and the effect of the elementary particles called neutrinos on the production of elements and the origin of the asymmetry in the cosmic abundance of matter over antimatter in the observed Universe. This project will also examine nuclear reaction mechanisms at very low energies. This research contributes to the support of national scientific priorities in Nuclear Science, in particular to the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams under construction at the Michigan State University campus, a world-leading laboratory for the study of nuclear structure, reactions and astrophysics. The research efforts to be carried out here will also contribute to the training of next generation of scientists, enabling them to take part in a competitive workforce capable of performing in diverse settings. <br/><br/>The sheer number of neutrinos emitted from a cooling proto-neutron star following the collapse of a supernova core necessitates inclusion of neutrino-neutrino interactions in the description of the neutrino transport in supernovae. Symmetries of the collective modes of this many-neutrino system and their impact on the rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis in supernovae will be investigated. An unidentified emission line was recently seen in the X-ray spectrum of galaxy clusters that could be interpreted as a signal emerging from a decaying seven keV sterile neutrino, which mixes with the active ones. The investigator and his students will explore the effects of such states in reactor experiments and assess the likelihood of existence of such a state. They will explore also effects of neutrino magnetic interactions on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, together with various ways to exploit symmetries in understanding double beta decay nuclear matrix elements. Finally, the PI will re-examine the interaction potential between two nuclei in the light of the recent experience with the effective field theory, hitherto applied only to the nucleon-nucleon interactions."
0.3,"Atomic nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons and exhibit a variety of shapes. Some nuclei are spherical, while others have non-spherical shapes (similar to an onion, a zucchini, or a pear); the shape of the nucleus is unique for each isotope of each element. Because we cannot take an ordinary photograph of the nucleus to investigate its shape and structure, other methods must be employed. Through reactions at the University of Kentucky particle accelerator, neutrons are produced and then scattered from the nucleus. In the process, the nucleus gains and subsequently releases energy that can be detected. This information is used to deduce the shape of the nucleus and to gain an understanding of how the neutrons and protons in the nucleus contribute to its properties. Graduates of this research program receive hands-on experience with particle accelerator operation, nuclear science instrumentation, radiation detection, and data acquisition systems, and emerge as well-trained nuclear scientists who are capable of important contributions to our national needs. <br/><br/><br/>The broad-based research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory includes studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to neutrinoless double-beta decay; nuclei undergoing shape transitions; deformed structures and shape coexistence; nuclear structure contributions in support of searches for fundamental symmetries. In this research, the inelastic scattering of fast neutrons is used to examine low-energy collective nuclear excitations and to obtain information, e.g., level lifetimes and transition multipole mixing ratios for non-yrast states, which is inaccessible with other reactions. Detailed investigations of stable nuclei complement advances in nuclear structure achieved by studying nuclei at extreme conditions of temperature and angular momentum or in regions far from stability. Experimental innovations in the laboratory, e.g., the development of capabilities for measuring lifetimes in heavy nuclei, have played a key role in this research. These advances, coupled with the unique capabilities of this laboratory for the production of high-quality, time-bunched monoenergetic neutrons, probe important questions and make meaningful contributions to our knowledge of nuclear structure."
0.13,"The research funded by this award is designed to promote a better understanding of atomic nuclei, the basic building blocks of all normal matter in the Universe. How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature? Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these? To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions. One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences. The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.<br/><br/>The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier. Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems. These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC). A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL. <br/><br/>In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons. This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics. Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements. The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND. <br/><br/>The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force."
0.31279,"The National Nuclear Physics Summer School, held annually since 1988, is an effort by the nuclear physics community to acquaint students with the forefront issues of the field and with the experimental and theoretical tools that are available to nuclear physics researchers. The intent is to broaden student appreciation for and interest in the field, while also strengthening them technically. Typically most of the field's major directions are represented in the lectures: hot and cold nuclear matter, electromagnetic physics, weak interactions, astrophysics, and nuclear structure. Advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers are the target audience. School organizers are charged with identifying outstanding lecturers from theory and experiment, conducting the school in a manner that encourages discussion and interaction, and developing supporting materials, including an online archive of lectures that can serve as a long-term reference for participating students and for others who are interested in the current status of nuclear physics. School organizers are assisted by the Principal Investigators and by a Steering Committee appointed by the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society.<br/><br/>The school is often the first opportunity for students to recognize the breadth of nuclear physics and to interact across subfields. Thus, it plays an important role in building a nuclear physics community. Student morale is enhanced by this opportunity and by the chance to meet with some of the field's leading researchers. The school allows students from under-represented groups to network with their peers. Students leave the school with stronger backgrounds in nuclear physics, and with new knowledge of their chosen specialties. As the lectures are preserved in an on-line archive, the students can return to this material when a need arises during their subsequent training and research. Students are given a chance to present talks and thus to gain experience in making presentations to a diverse audience."

The research in biofuels and wind energy will address the need to curtail green house gases (GHG) by advancing bio-renewable and wind substitutes for depleting fossil based hydrocarbons. Basic research will address technological problems associated with the optimal conversion of biomass into biofuels and wind into wind energy.

0.085,"Stars with masses greater than eight times the mass of the sun end their lives in an explosion called a core-collapse supernova. If the original star is between eight and twenty times the mass of the sun, the supernova leaves behind a neutron star. Neutron stars are ultra-dense objects with the mass of the sun and a diameter of about 15 miles. Normal matter is made of atoms consisting of electrons and nuclei, nuclei are made of neutrons and protons, and neutrons and protons, in turn, are made of up and down quarks. The gravitational force in the center of a neutron star, however, is sufficient to compress neutrons and protons together so tightly that neutrons and protons may be forced to convert into exotic particles containing strange quarks. The question of whether or not strange quarks are present in neutron stars, and the more general question of the nature of extremely dense matter, are some of the principal questions facing the nuclear physics and astrophysics communities. This project aims to answer these questions and to determine the nature of matter in the center of neutron stars where gravity compresses matter to a thousand trillion times the density of water. This project involves training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellow. Community outreach includes the education of students through the continued development of a Studio Physics course, involvement in research, and a web-based visualization of neutron stars.<br/><br/>Nuclear experiments and observations of neutron stars have successfully generated novel constraints on the equation of state of matter at densities near and above the central densities in atomic nuclei. However, our current understanding of high-densities is limited: we do not yet know the composition of the ground state. This project uses a combination of nuclear theory matched to nuclear data and neutron star observations to determine the composition of neutron star cores. Modern models of strongly-interacting matter will be combined with new nuclear structure calculations of neutron-rich nuclei in order to construct state of the art models of the neutron star crust and core. These models, and their concomitant uncertainties, will be calibrated with nuclear data and compared with neutron star cooling, mass, and radius observations. For example, neutron star cooling data has already given indications of fast cooling arising from a large proton-to-neutron ratio. This project will study the posterior probability distribution for the proton-to-neutron ratio and several other observables that will give insights into neutron star composition. <br/><br/>This proposal is co-funded by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Physics Division and the Division of Astronomical Sciences at NSF."
0.869999,"The elements observed on the earth and in our sun contain the most stable isotopes of nuclei. However, there are a great many other forms of these isotopes with greater or lesser numbers of neutrons that only exist for a short time. The formation of these unstable nuclei is essential for understanding the origin of the observed elements during astrophysics events such as supernovae explosions. This project in nuclear theory will contribute significantly to our understanding of the observed properties of stable and unstable nuclei and predicts properties that are not yet observed. This research quantifies the limits of nuclear stability and chains of formations and decays that are needed for understanding the formation of elements during the evolution of the universe. Nuclear decays are determined by the properties of the fundamental particles. The investigators will also study a form of double-beta decay in which no neutrinos are emitted and in which the mass of the neutrino may be determined. Furthermore, this project will advance computational and analytical methods in nuclear physics, and will add to an already rich computational program for nuclear structure that is being used worldwide.<br/><br/>Nuclear physics is at the heart of our understanding of the universe and the types of elementary particles with which it is composed. This project will have a significant impact on new developments in the field of nuclear theory, fundamental symmetries, nuclear astrophysics and the general field of mesoscopic physics. Topics to be studied include: (1) development of new analytical and computational tools for the description of nuclear structure (2) detailed theoretical studies of nuclear processes affecting unstable nuclei; (iii) calculations and modeling of structural and dynamical aspects of nuclear processes, including reactions of astrophysical interest; (iv) calculations of nuclear properties related to fundamental symmetries and double-beta decay; (v) development of the unified description of structure and reactions in open and marginally stable mesoscopic systems and quantum transport in problems of interest to quantum informatics; (vi) studies of the nucleus as a mesoscopic system, including many-body quantum chaos and its coexistence with collective and regular features. Many of these research topics are connected to the experimental programs at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and other laboratories worldwide. This work is also closely coupled with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA), and some projects bridge nuclear structure theory with other areas, such as condensed matter physics and quantum information. Strong educational and outreach component are integral components of this effort, as the nuclear physics program at MSU is widely recognized worldwide as a top program in this discipline."
3.067524,"Indian River State College establishes a Regional Center for Nuclear Education and Training (RC-NET). The Center ensures the demand for skilled nuclear technicians is met in a unified, systematic way in the Southeastern United States. Some of the goals of RC-NET are to create a comprehensive curriculum for technician tracks, develop or enhance training programs at the regional colleges, provide career paths to higher education and undergraduate research, and provide remote access to expensive and unique training components. This Regional Center serves the nuclear industry as a training resource, curriculum repository, and source of expertise, while improving communications and collaboration across the industry. RC-NET is supported by partnerships with colleges across the region. The partnerships include fifteen colleges, three universities and twenty seven industry partners. Collectively, this group represents a critical mass of training and industry experts.<br/><br/>By coordinating and supporting a network of dynamic training facilities capable of scaling up to meet the energy industry's needs, the Center reduces the risk associated with serious shortages in trained technicians. Traditionally, minority and female populations in the nuclear industry have been low; however, enrollment in IRSC's programs are above the national average. Highly qualified minority and female students are targeted to continue their education through scholarships, summer bridge programs, 2/3 articulation, and undergraduate research opportunities."
0.84,"The research program at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Laboratory focuses on timely topics in nuclear spectroscopy and neutron-induced reactions. Much of this work utilizes nearly monoenergetic fast neutrons and is reliant on the radiation detection capabilities we have developed. Our broad-based research includes selected studies in several forefront areas: nuclear structure relevant to double-beta decay and the mass of the neutrino, nuclei undergoing shape transitions, the decays of collective nuclear excitations, deformed nuclear structures and shape coexistence, nuclear structure contributions in support of searches for fundamental symmetries. The determination of nuclear level lifetimes in the femtosecond regime provides crucial information in many of these investigations. Additional projects that are particularly appropriate to the capabilities available in our laboratory are pursued, and collaborative research with colleagues from other institutions is a vital component of our program.<br/><br/>Education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels continues as the nexus of all activities in our laboratory, and graduates are trained nuclear scientists who are capable of making important contributions in meeting our national needs. Providing a supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component of our program, and students enthusiastically participate in experiments at other facilities, scientific conferences, and the activities of professional societies. Research at a small accelerator laboratory, such as ours, permits hands-on experience for students, and these young scientists are mentored on a daily basis. For many years, the research facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as scientists from other research universities, national laboratories, and nuclear-related industry. Research performed in our laboratory has contributed directly to addressing areas of national need, such as homeland security and the design of advanced nuclear reactors, and will continue to do so. These applications are well represented by the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator and research equipment. For example, collaborative studies with colleagues from industry have led to improved neutron-detection-based methods for the inspection of luggage for explosives and illegal drugs, and data obtained in our laboratory has been used to evaluate direct energy-storage devices. In each case, the unique capabilities of our laboratory were important considerations in the selection of our facility for this work."
0.379964,"The research objective of this award is to examine how individual nuclear components contribute to the mechanical properties of the cell nucleus using a novel optical-tweezers assay in conjunction with nuclei from the genetically-facile fission yeast, S. pombe. Studies conducted under this award will test how altering the size of the nucleus, the compaction of the genome, the fluidity of the nuclear membrane, and association of chromatin with the nuclear envelope affect nuclear mechanical properties. Lamins, which are key in determining the mechanical properties of mammalian nuclei, but do not occur natively in S. pombe, will be introduced heterologously to dissect their mechanical properties from their roles in mammalian signaling and gene regulation. Fluorescence imaging of specific chromosome locations during force application to the S. pombe LINC complex, which spans the nuclear membrane, will elucidate how force is communicated into the nuclear mechanical network.<br/><br/>If successful, these studies will elucidate how the mechanics of the nucleus emerge from its constituents, and delineate how the mechanical environment, which is essential for the differentiation programs that give rise to specific cell types, is communicated to the nucleus, where cell fate is largely determined. They will also establish S. pombe as a model system in which the mechanical role of lamins can be decoupled from their regulatory functions, thus providing a platform for future studies of lamin mutants that cause such diseases as lipodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, and progeria. Because embryonic stem (ES) cells and yeast express very low levels or no lamins, respectively, these studies will also lead to new insights into how extracellular mechanical cues drive ES cell differentiation. On the educational side, the students involved in these studies will become a new generation of teacher-scientists, who excel at quantitative approaches and possess the biological sophistication to identify and tackle cutting-edge biological problems."
0.474269,"This award provides continued support for the REU site at the Cyclotron Institute at Texas A&M University (TAMU). The new award includes a collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and a significantly refined outreach activity, Street Physics. <br/><br/>The need for increased efforts in recruiting the next generation of young people into nuclear science was recently emphasized in a report by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee. Involvement in research at the undergraduate level is believed to be an important component in increasing the numbers and preparation of students entering graduate programs. The students supported through this award will be in residence for 10 weeks in conjunction with the summer session at TAMU, for which they will receive a $5000 fellowship, housing, travel and most importantly the opportunity to work closely with internationally renowned scientists at a first-rate university-based nuclear facility. The research projects are at the leading edge Nuclear Science, including sub-fields such as nuclear astrophysics, weak interactions, nuclear dynamics and thermodynamics, nuclear structure, RHIC, atomic ionizations, and radiation effects. There are proposed projects both in theoretical and experimental Nuclear Science. Some students will work at the Cyclotron Institute, which is a DOE Nuclear Physics Center of Excellence. The facilities include a K500 superconducting cyclotron, a K150 cyclotron and associated state-of the art detector systems. The Cyclotron Institute and the department of physics are also home base for involvement in experiments at other facilities, such as RHIC, ANL, and TRIUMF. The faculty at TAMU are leading scientists in the field and have a history of working with undergraduates in their research programs."
0.75,"One of the frontier areas of nuclear physics is the study of the structure of atomic nuclei far from the valley of stability. In atomic nuclei the single-particle orbitals are expected to change as a function of neutron and proton number, and in addition are very sensitive to the presence of deformation. Single-particle characteristics can be probed in single-particle transfer reactions. Light-ion transfer reactions will be studied with beam energies near the Coulomb barrier and about 40-MeV per nucleon. Studies will concentrate on neutron-rich nuclei near the N=50 and N=82 neutron shell closures and light nuclei important to understand nucleosynthesis in stars. These studies will be carried out with accelerated beams of rare isotopes at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University, the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory and the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. One focus is to extract spectroscopic strengths with reduced dependence on theoretical model parameters. <br/><br/>Another challenge in nuclear structure physics is to understand the balance between a microscopic description of the nuclear wave function and a model based on collective motions of the nucleons within the nucleus. This balance changes as a function of excitation energy and angular momentum and may be quite different in nuclei away from the valley of stability from the observed behavior of nuclei near stability. The focus of the second component of this proposal addresses, via measurements of the magnetic moments of excited states, the interplay of single-particle configurations with an underlying spherical or deformed core. The technique of Coulomb excitation in inverse kinematics is well established and has been tested on radioactive beams (RIBs). However, recent high statistics experiments carried out with heavier nuclei than in the past, and with higher energy beams, have uncovered several issues that need to be addressed before the methods are tried at the new RIB facilities. Semi-magic Tin-126 will be studied at HRIBF. A new program of research to be established at the ATLAS facility will focus initially on the low-lying states of Samarium-150 and Gadolinium-152 and on the efficacy of alpha transfer reactions. <br/><br/>The structure of the proposed activities is designed to have as large an impact as possible on the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as postdoctoral associates. The project will also serve to enhance the diversity of the nuclear science workforce by including early career scientists who are women or come from other under-represented backgrounds. The participation of these early career scholars in the forefront research would prepare them for careers in higher education and basic and applied research, in national laboratories and industry. <br/><br/>The anticipated nuclear physics results are also of importance in astronomy, to understand the abundance of elements observed in the cosmos; in condensed matter physics, to understand the microscopic components of the transient hyperfine field; and for nuclear energy and national security, to understand properties of and reactions on fission fragments."
0.072855,"Physical reality is described in modern physics using four fundamental forces: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, the electromagnetic force, and gravity. The strong nuclear force is responsible for a long list of phenomena that are crucial to the existence of the universe. For example, the strong force holds together atomic nuclei, it fuels the burning of the sun and all other stars, and it governed the fate of the very early universe. Although the fundamental equations describing the strong force (or quantum chromodynamics, QCD) were written down four decades ago, an in-depth understanding of its properties is still lacking. This project will help advance the understanding of key features of the strong force at very high temperatures and densities. At temperatures of about 1,000,000,000,000 degrees all matter subject to the strong nuclear force forms a state of matter called quark gluon plasma. Quark gluon plasma was prevalent in the early universe milliseconds after the Big Bang. The quark gluon plasma can be recreated in the laboratory in collisions of very large nuclei in the highest energy collider facilities in the world, such as the Large Hadron Collider in Europe and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the US. The PI, working with his graduate students, will carry out research to improve the understanding of the formation and development of quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions. <br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive computational simulation of nuclear collisions. The initial phase of those collisions at high energy is dominated by strong, nonlinear gluon fields. Because nuclei collide in random configurations and with random impact parameters an event-by-event Monte Carlo simulation of gluon fields will be provided. The system eventually reaches approximate local kinetic equilibrium and the further time evolution can be followed up by relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. Comparison to data from LHC and RHIC can determine the equation of state and important transport coefficients of quark gluon plasma. The project will also shed light on the coupling of quark gluon plasma to electromagnetic probes (photons). In addition, the PI and his students will study the effect of the initial strong gluon fields on very fast quarks and gluons (jets), and on heavy quarks. Both of those are important probes for properties of quark gluon plasma. The project will also provide tools for the next generation collider experiments planned at an electron ion collider. The latter will allow for a systematic study of strong gluon fields and the creation of quark and gluon jets in a nuclear environment."
0.089996,"The elementary particles or ""quanta"" of light have a wavelength of about 500 nanometers (less than 20 millionths of an inch). The study of the interaction of these photons with the electrons inside atoms led to development of devices such as lasers, atomic clocks, supersensitive miniature magnetometers, etc. The goal of the present project is to extend these studies to photons of much shorter wavelengths: 10,000 to 100,000 times shorter. These photons, invisible to the naked eye, begin to enter the regime where they are known as ""gamma-photons"" or ""gamma-rays."" Rather than interacting with the electrons inside atoms, these high energy photons interact with the nucleus of the atom. Some of the reasons gamma-photons might be better than conventional (optical) photons for applications is that they can be detected more easily, they can be focused to much smaller spots (ultimately limited by the wavelength of the photon), and they can in principle help process information more quickly because of their higher frequencies. A problem is that they are currently very difficult and expensive to produce and hard to control precisely because conventional optical lenses and mirrors do not work at such short wavelengths. This work seeks to advance the development of compact (""table-top"") sources of highly controlled gamma-photons, both through experiments and theoretical work. In effect, this work seeks to extend the field of ""quantum optics"" to wavelengths approaching the gamma-ray regime. If successful, the work may find applications in the areas of quantum information science, spectroscopy, microscopy, metrology, and sensors. The proposed joint theoretical and experimental research program will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging field of the experimental and theoretical quantum gamma-optics as well as in the related (and more general) experimental techniques, analytical methods, and numerical modeling.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the experimental and theoretical development of methods to coherently control the interaction of gamma-photons with nuclear ensembles via the variation of the resonant frequency of the nuclear transition in the laboratory reference frame. This variation is achieved via the Doppler shift associated with precisely vibrating the solid through which the photon passes. This is used in conjunction with a source of heralded single photons provided by the essentially simultaneous emission of two photons at 122 keV and 14.4 keV via the natural radioactive decay of Cobalt-57. The advantages of nuclear transitions over electronic transitions is that they have narrow, lifetime-broadened spectral linewidths in bulk solids at room temperature (due to the large mass and small size of nucleons, shielding from the environment, and recoilless absorption due to the Mossbauer effect). This results in orders-of-magnitude stronger interaction of the photons with the nuclear ensemble. Progress has been limited, however, by the absence of bright coherent sources and high finesse resonators in the desired short wavelength range. The present work is based on the lead scientist's recent realization of a table-top source of ultra-short photon sources in the 14.4 keV range with coherent properties, as well as the demonstration of efficient control of single gamma-photon waveforms (F. Vagizov et al., Nature, vol. 508| 3 April 2014, p. 80). The technical and fundamental limitations of the technique as presently developed will be explored and new techniques for the production of short intense pulses and single gamma-photon shaping will be developed. Applications for the controlled single-photon waveforms will be explored in the areas of quantum information science."
0.27,"Nature is governed by only four fundamentally different forces: electromagnetism, gravity, the strong force (which binds protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus), and the weak force (which governs certain radioactive decays and the interactions of some exotic particles). The goal of this project is to investigate certain properties of the weak force. The weak force has some features in common with the more familiar electromagnetic and gravitational forces, but also some differences. Elementary particles (such as electrons and quarks) have a particular electric charge, which determines the strength of electromagnetic force they exert, and a particular mass, which determines the strength of gravitational force they exert. By contrast, each elementary particle has two different numerical properties, analogous to electric charge, that determine the strength of the weak force they can exert. One of these numbers (known as the axial weak charge) gets modified whenever the particle is also being subjected to strong forces, such as when a proton is surrounded by other neutrons and protons inside an atomic nucleus. The precise way that the axial weak charge is modified in the presence of the strong force is a long-standing question in nuclear physics. Substantial effort has been made to understand this behavior, using large-scale experiments at accelerator facilities. In contrast, the approach funded by the present grant uses a room-sized apparatus staffed by only a few people in order to make precise measurements of the quantum mechanical energy levels in molecules. Tiny shifts in these energy levels signal the effect of the weak force, and the scientists can interpret these shifts in terms of the axial weak charge of the atomic nuclei inside the molecule. In a general sense, this project also advances the range of techniques for precision measurement science, which in the past has led to unexpected breakthroughs in technology; for example, in an earlier phase of this project the group invented a new type of magnetic resonance probe that may have broad applications.<br/><br/> The supported group uses parity violation (PV) as a tool to isolate the effect of the weak force. To isolate the nuclear axial weak charge they measure how PV depends on the nuclear spin orientation. They use diatomic molecules to achieve a dramatic increase in sensitivity compared to similar experiments with atoms. The small energy splittings and narrow spectral lines associated with hyperfine/rotational structure in molecules enhance the size of nuclear spin-dependent (NSD) PV effects by orders of magnitude relative to those in atoms. The specific goal of this work is to measure the NSD-PV effect associated with the 137Ba nucleus in the molecule BaF. This will provide a measurement of the effective axial weak charge of 137Ba. It is expected that this quantity is dominated by an effect known as the nuclear anapole moment. The anapole moment describes a distribution of magnetic fields within a nucleus that can only be induced by the weak force acting within the nucleus. It has been observed in only one nucleus so far, with a size well outside the expected range based on other kinds of experiments that have probed how the weak force is modified in the presence of strong interactions. The proposed measurement with 137Ba should shed light on this discrepancy. The method used in the proposed work also has the promise to extend to measurements on a wide range of nuclei, which would provide a rich data set for comparison to theoretical models of this phenomenon."
0.1312,"General Audience Summary<br/><br/>In this project, a postdoctoral research fellow will engage in a study of the making of citizen nuclear intelligence and its role in framing public debates about nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction. The results of this project will serve to enhance understanding of nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction by showing how distinctive knowledge communities frame nuclear-proliferation risks in distinctive ways, and how those are changing in the post-9/11 era. The results of this project will be communicated in academic journal, and in arms-control periodicals. They will contribute to ongoing discussions in STS and policy studies, and in nuclear security studies. They will also provide a clearer understanding of how nuclear intelligence products are made and used, which could thereby enable arms-control analysts to better engage with policy makers and enable policy makers to better interpret and deploy nuclear intelligence in national efforts to avoid costly foreign confrontations and slow the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In addition, this work will help appraise the role that information technologies can play in informing publics about complex technological and societal problems.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project centers around three sets of research question. The PI will determine what are the tools, practices and themes present in open-source nuclear intelligence analyses, and how these compare and interact with the traditional analysis practices of intelligence and nuclear-safeguards institutions. He will also address how the knowledge products of open-source communities affect the framing of public debates within the US about nuclear technologies and weapons of mass destruction, and the extent to which these shape national procurements and foreign policy. Finally, he will explore how the knowledge frameworks of open-source communities, and the national actions they inspire, interact on a global stage with international institutions, coalitions, and nuclear events. To engage with these questions, he will adopt a mixed methods approach. In particular, he will us qualitative media analysis of various documents including open-source intelligence products, news media related to nuclear proliferation, and government documents that reveal how decision makers are informed about nuclear activities. He will also conduct formal interviews with open-source analysts, tasking committees of satellite-imagery vendors, government decision makers, journalists, and nuclear-safeguards experts in the Department of Energy and at the International Atomic Energy Agency. In doing so, he will draw on current STS theories pioneered by his mentor, and complement ongoing STS projects related to nuclear energy and risk."
0.01409,"Nuclear Science is tasked with answering questions such as: (i) How did matter come into being and how does it evolve? (ii) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? (iii) How can the knowledge and technology progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? Providing answers to these questions depends on a detailed theoretical understanding of nuclear reactions, a field in which current approaches are either outdated or limited to a small number of applications. In this larger context, this project will focus on the theoretical study of deuteron-induced reactions. Due to the short lifetimes involving exotic nuclei, direct neutron capture measurements of relevance to the origin of the heavy elements are often not possible. Indirect techniques like deuteron induced reactions are a common tool to extract the relevant astrophysical rates. These reactions are part of ongoing experimental programs at radioactive beam facilities, as well as programs at future facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). As such, this project will provide theoretical support to challenging experimental programs and will provide a unique training opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br/><br/>A reliable reaction theory is critical for the understanding the data produced at experimental programs using (d,p) reactions. From a theoretical perspective, (d,p) reactions are attractive because the scattering can be reduced to an effective three-body problem. One of the most challenging aspects of solving the three-body problems for nuclear reactions is posed by the repulsive Coulomb interaction. While for light nuclei the momentum-space Faddeev equations can be treated by screening the Coulomb force, a similar approach is difficult to implement for heavy systems. Indeed, for most of the new exotic nuclei to be produced at FRIB, currently available computational methods are not adequate. This project will address this critical need and provide an implementation of an exact Faddeev method for the three-body nuclear reaction problem, in which the Coulomb force will be treated without screening."
0.21,"The dynamics of central nuclear collisions involves simultaneous and nontrivial interactions of many nuclear constituents. Such interactions are a challenge for nuclear theory and are important for studies of the physics of the early Universe. Unfortunately, current descriptions of nuclear collisions rely on the semiclassical limit of the dynamics. Overcoming previous technical difficulties in the numerical implementation of the quantal theory of nuclear reactions, in this project the investigator and his collaborators will develop new strategies for the numerical implementation of this many-body theory in one and two dimensions, before attacking the realistic three-dimensional case. The resulting upgrade in software infrastructure for nuclear collisions will support the experimental program at the future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams currently under construction on the Michigan State University campus. The computational methods developed in this project are likely to benefit research in other fields, such as studies of electron transport across nanoscale electronic devices in electrical engineering, and will train the postdoc and student involved in cutting-edge computational techniques.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop the computational framework for a quantal description of central nuclear collisions based on a nonequilibrium Green functions approach that is expected to open up the path towards a first-principles description of nuclear reactions. By following the quantal rather than the semiclassical evolution of many-body systems, the PI and his collaborators will reduce the level of uncertainty in the analysis of energetic collisions for the study of bulk nuclear properties, including the symmetry energy and the transport properties of matter. The successful completion of this project will provide useful tools for studies of head-on nuclear collisions and excitations of collective resonances, and will prepare the ground for future studies of collisions at finite impact parameter."
0.63392,"All of the matter on Earth is composed primarily of stable or long-lived isotopes created in a stellar explosion billions of years ago. However, the isotopes we observe here on Earth comprise only a small fraction of those that are known to exist. Study of short-lived, or rare, isotopes is key to understanding the origin of matter in the universe, how neutrons and protons collectively form into atomic nuclei, and to explore fundamental symmetries of nature. As these rare isotopes are not naturally occurring on Earth, they must be created in powerful particle accelerators, such those at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), located on the campus of Michigan State University (MSU). There beams of rare isotopes are created at half the speed of light. However, some of the most precise experimental techniques for probing the properties of rare isotopes require beams with energies up to a billion times less than what they are created with at NSCL. These high-energy beams can be slowed using solid degraders and brought to rest in a chamber filled with a buffer gas, a technique currently in use at the NSCL. The development of a next-generation Advanced Cryogenic Gas Stopper (ACGS) will improve the efficiency and speed at which rare isotopes are delivered to experiments, expanding the reach of several experimental programs to even more exotic isotopes. It will benefit the user community of the NSF-funded NSCL and, through the scientific progress it enables, society at large. The project will follow NSCL and MSU policies for ensuring a diverse scientific workforce. A state-of-the-art development project like ACGS, with close ties to a leading research university that actively encourages and supports a multicultural research body, will create an optimal environment for under-represented and minority students to be trained as scientists.<br/><br/>The ACGS is a next-generation high-performance linear gas-stopping device for converting fast rare isotope beams into stopped beams that can be used directly or reaccelerated. The delivery of rare-isotope beams over a wide range of energies is necessary to maximize the number of experimental techniques that can be employed. Beams with energies of 0.01 to 100 keV are used in high-precision experiments with ion traps and lasers, to measure nuclear binding energies (masses), to determine nuclear radii and moments, and to test fundamental symmetries at levels complementing much more expensive high-energy experiments. Precision beams of rare isotopes with energies of 0.1 to 20 MeV/u are used to measure cross sections of key reactions that are critical for understanding nuclear synthesis in the cosmos and for nuclear reaction studies that help determine detailed nuclear properties needed for further advances in nuclear theory. After installation at the NSCL, the ACGS will provide high-purity beams with high efficiency, with short extraction times to provide access to short-lived isotopes, and with a high beam rate capability to enable world-class science, in particular with reaccelerated beams. Fast beams provided by NSCL's Coupled Cyclotron Facility will be slowed down in solid degraders prior to being stopped in helium gas inside the ACGS. The thermalized ions are then guided to an extraction orifice using RF ion transport techniques and a low-energy, so called ""stopped"" beam is formed. The design is tailored to allow the ACGS to accept incident beam rates exceeding 10^8/s. A novel electrode design, compared to existing linear gas stoppers, will provide an order of magnitude higher beam rate capability and cryogenic operation guarantees delivery of clean rare isotope beams. The use of novel RF-carpet ion-transport techniques will provide extraction times as short as ten milliseconds. The ACGS is best suited for the stopping of medium-to-heavy-mass isotopes that have relatively narrow range straggling distributions in the helium gas and will constitute a high-performance complement to the light-ion Cyclotron Stopper already being built at the NSCL. The availability of intense stopped and reaccelerated beams of short-lived isotopes will play a critical role in the future research program at the NSCL and will be a key feature of research at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) under construction at MSU."
0.4,"Nuclear physics plays a key role in our quest to understand the Universe, addressing fundamental scientific questions like: 1) How did matter come into being and how does it evolve? 2) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? 3) Are the fundamental interactions that are basic to the structure of matter fully understood?, and 4) How can the knowledge and technological progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? In recent years, researchers have made remarkable progress in our fundamental understanding of the complex and fascinating system that is the nucleus. This progress has been driven by new theoretical insights and increased computational power, as well as by experimental access to new isotopes with a large excess of neutrons or protons. The latter involves large societal investments in scientific forefront experimental facilities like the Facility of Radioactive Ion Beams, which is being built at Michigan State University in the U.S.A. The mentoring of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows is an integral part of the project. Their professional development toward independence as original and productive scientists is a central objective of the project and will continue to prepare them for industry or academic institutions.<br/><br/>While much has been learned so far about nuclear systems and associated phenomena, much remains to be understood. This project aims to advance our basic understanding of subatomic matter by addressing many of the above fundamental questions. For nuclear theorists, the challenge is to develop a comprehensive and unified description of nuclei and their reactions, grounded in the fundamental interactions between the constituent nucleons with quantifiable uncertainties to maximize predictive power. To model such systems according to the laws of motion and the underlying nuclear forces, requires the development of sophisticated physical and mathematical algorithms. To address this challenge, this group will develop a toolbox of methods for dealing with many strongly-interacting particles (protons and neutrons) capable of treating a wide variety of nuclear systems, ranging from stable closed-shell nuclei and nuclear matter as seen in for example neutron stars to exotic loosely-bound neutron and proton rich nuclei far from shell closures. The toolbox will make use of state-of-the-art microscopic inputs and will be built around modern many-particle methods. A premium will be placed on developing reliable theoretical error bars, which stem in part from truncation errors used to derive nuclear forces, uncertainties in the fitted parameters of the input interactions, truncated approximations intended to ""soften"" the input Hamiltonian, basis-set truncation errors, and truncation errors in the particular level of many-body approximation. By developing powerful many-body methods capable of treating a wide range of nuclear systems with controlled uncertainties, this project will bring us one step closer to being able to answer the above fundamental questions of nuclear physics."
1.352735,"With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Stephen Hill from Florida State University (FSU) and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) and colleagues William Brey and Johan van Tol will develop a custom spectrometer equipped with a magnet and probes capable of supporting both high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) at relatively high fields and frequencies. The main idea is to combine these methodologies, resulting in a high-field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) instrument for organic solutions that would allow the study of samples that are mass limited and thus can only be prepared in very low concentrations. The target is to operate at 14.1 T, requiring nuclear and electron irradiation at 600 MHz and 395 GHz, respectively. The design is based on rapid shuttling inside the NMR magnet between the homogeneity sweet spot, which will be used for the NMR experiments, and a location just above, where the DNP will be performed by microwave irradiation. The new instrument will lead to an enhancement in sensitivity of the typical organic NMR experiment (including essentially any NMR experiment implemented today on molecules dissolved in organic solvent) by over two orders of magnitude. A 50-fold enhancement in sensitivity is expected with successful DNP implementation, with further gains coming from adapting existing NHMFL-based orthogonal technologies utilizing cryogenic high temperature superconducting NMR probe platforms. Such enhancements will open wide new fields of applications in many of areas of interest to NMR spectroscopists. Examples are organic structure determinations, synthesis and screening of pharmaceuticals, elucidation of natural product structures, and metabolomics analyses.<br/><br/>The proposed instrument will combine three techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. Similarly, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of short-lived, highly reactive species involved in important chemical and biochemical processes. DNP utilizes EPR in order to overcome one of NMR's main drawbacks - its inherent low sensitivity. By irradiating stable electron radicals that have been co-mixed with molecular targets of interest with high-power microwaves tuned to the appropriate EPR frequency (395 GHz in this case), polarization can be transferred to the target nuclei via the electron spins. The increased nuclear polarization results in increased sensitivity in NMR experiments and thus improves the chances of using samples that can only be prepared in very low concentrations, e.g., from rare natural products or bioproducts. This research will have a major impact in improving NMR screening capabilities and will catalyze pharmaceutical development, while also training the next generation of instrumentalists by combining the expertise of chemists, physicists and biochemists."
0.559633,"This project probes the fundamental physics of neutrinos and nuclei by exploiting the intersection of exciting new developments in nuclear physics and neutrino physics on the one hand, and the increasingly sophisticated astrophysical and astronomical probes of compact objects, nucleosynthesis histories, and cosmology on the other. A key issue in this enterprise will be studying how neutrinos interact in dense matter and how these interactions may cause neutrinos to change their flavors. To these ends, this UCSD effort will work toward: (1) Formulating and understanding the quantum kinetic equations which govern neutrino flavor evolution in a general medium; (2) Constructing large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor evolution in various supernova, stellar collapse, and compact object merger environments and assessing the feedback of this neutrino flavor physics on the prospects for the synthesis of nuclei in these sites; (3) Understanding neutrino-nucleus interactions, nuclear partition functions, and weak strength distributions in high temperature environments; and (4) Assessing how uncertainties and new beyond-standard-model possibilities in the neutrino sector could impact ideas on nucleosynthesis, dark matter, compact object physics, and cosmology, with an eye toward finding constraints otherwise unobtainable in the laboratory.<br/><br/>The research supported in this project will provide insights into how atomic nuclei and radiation behave in extreme conditions of temperature and density. In turn, these insights could give important clues about the nature of some elementary particles and the origin of the elements, for example, in the fiery interiors of supernova explosions, or at the time when the universe was only seconds old. These are fundamental questions that will provide unique opportunities for the training of young scientists, nuclear physicists, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels."
0.155294,"The cell nuclear envelope is the physical barrier between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The envelope regulates gene expression by allowing the access of proteins to DNA through passageways called nuclear pores. The nuclear envelope is unique in that it has two lipid bilayers (not one as is the case with cell membranes). The bilayers are maintained at a regular (and large) distance of nearly 45 nm. How these two bilayers are maintained at that regular spacing, and how they fuse together to form nuclear pores are current open questions in biology; this award is focused on answering these questions. By discovering an explanation for protein-mediated control of bilayer separation, this research will ultimately help develop new strategies for treating diseases that have been linked to mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins. The research program will provide opportunities to recruit outstanding students from underrepresented groups at the University of Houston (UH) and the University of Florida (UF). The findings of the research will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations and graduate and undergraduate courses at UH and UF.<br/><br/>The award will promote a collaborative partnership between investigators involving experiments, modeling and simulations to elucidate the fundamental physics that underlies nuclear lipid bilayer structure. The experimental work will discover how SUN proteins, which are conserved across different eukaryotic cell types and link the nucleus to the cytoskeleton maintain lipid bilayer structure and integrity. Theoretical work will seek to interpret the experimental findings in the framework of continuum mechanics, by computing the energetics of bilayer separation and fusion. The numerical and experimental findings will be used together to explain the mechanism of bilayer separation."
0.4,"Although ninety-eight percent of the mass of ordinary matter is due to the strong nuclear force, the present theory of that force (Quantum Chromodynamics) is still not fully understood. This award supports the study of the strong nuclear force by probing the substructure of matter. Almost the entire mass of an atom is concentrated in its tiny nucleus, which is made of nucleons that are either positively charged (protons) or electrically neutral (neutrons). These subatomic particles, however, are not elementary but are themselves composite objects made of quarks held together by glue particles (gluons). The structure of nucleons is a manifestation of the strong nuclear force, which is the strongest force known. This research will help advance discovery and understanding in nuclear physics, and promote teaching, training, and learning. The preparation of junior scientists plays a central role in the supported activities.<br/><br/>The nuclear physics research program at the University of South Carolina (USC) is mainly based at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia. There, the group uses high-energy electron and photon beams along with sophisticated particle detectors that were developed, in part, at USC as powerful microscopes to study the subatomic world. The group is also preparing the MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. This experiment will address the proton-radius puzzle by scattering muons and electrons off the proton. Through detector development, simulations, management of complex experiments, and data analyses, they will shed light on some of the most profound questions like: What is the structure of the nucleon? What are and how can we excite its internal degrees of freedom? Once excited, in which way does the nucleon decay back to its original state? Does the structure of the nucleon change if it is embedded in dense nuclear matter? The experimental study of these properties gives insight into the nature of the strong force and allows for rigorous tests of the underlying theory."
0.1,"This research is part of a large effort in the Hall A experimental research area at Jefferson Laboratory. Our scientific interest is to help constrain the so-called ""equation of state"" of nuclear matter, a critical ingredient to understanding the makeup of dense stars. We do this by scattering a beam of polarized electrons from the nuclei of lead atoms, where the dependence of the scattering probability on polarization direction tells us the average distribution of neutrons in this large, spherical nucleus. The contribution funded here is for a precision apparatus that would tell us the degree of polarization of the electron beam. Such an apparatus is also critical for a large number of different experiments in Hall A, and is consequently a service to the nuclear physics community. The scientific impact on the nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics communities is very large, and the work is carried out with a number of students in various disciplines, at different levels. Consequently, students gain training not only in nuclear physics, but in magnetic transport applications and precision engineering, both as undergraduates and graduate students."
0.68,"The study of the strong nuclear force under extremely high temperature and energy density is one of the key areas of investigation in nuclear physics. The theoretical framework of the strong force is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), whose fundamental particles are the quarks and gluons. These in turn build up protons and neutrons, which are understood to be the low-energy phase of quarks, bound by the strong nuclear force. At the very high temperatures reached in relativistic heavy ion collisions, the aim of this project to study how protons and neutrons melt into constituent quarks and gluons, which are no longer bound. This high-temperature phase of nuclear matter is called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy-ion experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider have produced striking evidence for QGP formation. The field is moving towards a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of the QGP.<br/><br/>Given this background, the project focuses on the experimental measurement of three distinct thermodynamic properties of this novel state of nuclear matter with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The first property to be measured is the temperature produced in the hottest stages of the collision. This is done via the study of Upsilon mesons, a bound state of heavy ""bottom"" quarks. In the hot, early stage of the collision even heavy-quark bound states, like the Upsilon, are expected to melt in the collision. The group will study the melting pattern of Upsilons and their excited states with STAR and with CMS in proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions. This measurement will provide crucial information to test models of the deconfinement of quarks in the high-temperature QGP. The second goal is to study the thermodynamic phase structure of the strong force. In particular, testing the existence of a predicted QCD critical point is a key component of this goal. This study is done with STAR by varying the collision energy, and thereby exploring the transition between normal nuclear matter and QGP matter. The third goal is to study the density of the medium using events in which a neutral electroweak boson, the Z0, is produced in coincidence with a quark jet. The Z0 is unaffected by the QGP, providing a clean estimate of the transverse momentum of the quark jet. As the partner jet traverses the dense QGP medium and loses energy, these Z0 + quark jet events are one of the best ways to study the energy loss of quarks.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work are aimed at underrepresented minorities and women. The first is to communicate the excitement of high-energy nuclear physics to Latino students at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), through mentoring activities at the conference and support of the UC Davis SACNAS chapter. The second component is promotion of science and physics to elementary and high-school students through visits to elementary schools with large Latino populations, and via participation in the Adopt-A-Physicist program for high schools. Finally, the PIs in the project will mentor undergraduates, including NSF REU students, every year. A key part of these goals is the mentoring of our own graduate students to become leaders in these activities, since many are women and underrepresented minorities, and are therefore excellent role models."
3.135,"This award funds a broad program of measurements in nuclear physics by faculty and students at Florida State University (FSU). The experiments include studies of nuclear reactions and decays that play key roles in all stages of stellar processes. This aspect of the program supports the large investment made and being made in astronomical observations worldwide. Other experiments focus on the evolution of nuclear shell structure with increasing neutron number, especially near the magic numbers of 20 and 28. The behavior of nuclei at ultra-high spin will be explored through discrete gamma spectroscopy using arrays of gamma detectors at FSU and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The group will also exploit heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to investigate the characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma. The broader societal impacts of this project lie in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in a hands-on environment. Florida State University has served as one of the leading educators in the field of nuclear physics (4th highest Ph.D. production in the U.S.) and this grant will enable the group to continue to attract and train the best and brightest graduate students in experimental nuclear physics. Because of the students' training and hands-on work with high tech equipment in a forefront nuclear physics laboratory, FSU graduates are in high demand and now serve in key roles in homeland security, national defense, high-tech industry, leading edge research, and STEM education. Finally, these measurements will be important for understanding stellar processes and the abundance of elements in our universe. <br/><br/>A significant part of the proposed research uses short-lived rare nuclear isotopes from the FSU Fox Laboratory to study nuclear reactions and structure in unstable nuclei. This is very important for reactions of astrophysical importance, many of which proceed through unstable nuclei. These beams have low intensity and so will benefit from the ANASEN active target and detector array recently developed by FSU in collaboration with Louisiana State University. A newly developed neutron detector array (RESONEUT) will be used to study (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics with radioactive beams. A series of experiments is planned to measure the critical parameter of lifetime following beta decay of heavy, neutron-rich nuclei on and close to the expected r-process path at TRIUMF. The confrontation of state-of-the-art shell model calculations for multiple cross-shell excitations with proposed nuclear structure measurements will strengthen their reliability for extrapolation to the astrophysically important region. The FSU 14C beam will be used to explore nuclear structure in more neutron-rich nuclei with a recently digitized Germanium detector array. Measurements using gamma detector arrays (GRETINA and GAMMASPHERE) will explore newly proposed exotic shapes and ultra-high-spin structures in the atomic mass ~ 150 region. Other work involves studying the quark-gluon plasma with heavy flavor probes using the PHENIX detector system, parts of which were constructed at FSU. In this instance the FSU focus is on the effects of cold nuclear matter on heavy quarkonia production."
0.00945,"A team of researchers at Louisiana State University will address the significant computational challenges inherent to modeling the intricate dynamics of atomic nuclei, which are fundamental to a vast array of astrophysical phenomena. They will do so by employing the petascale resources of the Blue Waters Supercomputer. More specifically, the investigators will carry out large-scale computations of intermediate-mass nuclei from oxygen to argon, including exotic unstable isotopes that are the focus of current and next-generation rare isotope experimental facilities. Such nuclei are often found key to understanding processes in extreme environments, from stellar explosions to the interior of nuclear reactors. Reliable nuclear structure information provided by this research project will have impacts on basic research questions in astrophysics and neutrino physics, and will also have potential applications in areas like nuclear energy, thus contributing to the nation's energy infrastructure. Training in utilizing large-scale computational resources will be provided to, the next generation of physicists, and the team will expand the impact of their research by providing nuclear structure information of unprecedented accuracy and scope as a publicly available database for use by other scientists. <br/><br/>The LSU team's approach is to solve the Schrodinger equation for a many-body quantum system composed of protons and neutrons interacting via realistic interactions that are tied to the underlying quark/gluon considerations. The solution to this problem is achieved by finding eigenstates and eigenvalues of the nuclear Hamiltonian, which is computed in a physically relevant basis that capitalizes on exact and approximate symmetries of nuclei. The use of such symmetries is a unique feature of our model, one that coupled with the Blue Waters capabilities makes solutions feasible. Namely, the team will employ the symmetry-adapted no-core shell model approach implemented by a highly scalable computer code, dubbed ""LSU3shell"", that has already demonstrated good scalability and performance on the Blue Waters system. Calculations will provide nuclear properties of short-lived neutron-deficient and neutron-rich isotopes with little to no available experimental data that are expected to have a considerable impact on modeling X-ray burst observables, on triggering processes responsible for the synthesis of many of the heavy elements present in the universe, and on providing a stringent test of fundamental symmetries in nature and physics beyond the Standard model."
0.250003,"The behavior of uranium (U) in the environment is of central importance to many branches of Earth Science. Decay of the radioactive uranium isotopes 238U and 235U forms the basis for the most accurate dating techniques suitable for studying events in deep time. The rarer, shorter-lived 234U isotope is also used for measuring the ages of events within the past million years. Uranium is also a significant environmental pollutant, and a useful trace element for studying chemical processes in the Earth. Recently, geochemists have begun to study the ways that natural chemical reactions (as opposed to radioactivity and other nuclear reactions) act to separate uranium isotopes from each other. These separations are subtle, changing 238U/235U ratios by roughly one part in a thousand, but they may provide a way to study the history of environmental oxygen, life, rock melting, and other natural processes through their effects on the uranium isotope compositions of ancient samples. The goal of the study is to use methods from theoretical chemistry to try to predict how chemical reactions in nature and in the laboratory might preferentially affect different uranium isotopes. Theoretical studies of this type have been important in the development of other isotopic techniques, such as the use of oxygen 18 to 16 ratio measurements in carbonate shells to infer ancient environmental temperatures. However, the very high atomic number of uranium makes its isotopes susceptible to a different type of chemical separation than most other elements, for which isotope separation is almost always driven by differences in mass between different isotopes. For uranium, isotope separations driven by differences in the physical size (i.e., the volume) of the uranium nuclei must also be accounted for, in order for theoretical calculations to be accurate. Including this nuclear volume effect will be a focus of the technical effort. The proposed research will support the training of a female doctoral student, undergraduate research, a scientific computing facility used for both research and classroom instruction, and outreach through the creation and improvement of Wikipedia articles on topics in geochemistry and environmental science.<br/><br/>The project will investigate equilibrium isotope fractionation of uranium in a variety of crystalline and aqueous species using electronic structure theory, taking advantage of recently developed methods for predicting mass-independent isotope fractionations driven by the volume component of the nuclear field shift effect in crystalline materials. The present theoretical understanding of uranium isotope fractionation is limited to a few simple gas-phase molecules and analogues of dissolved species, despite a rapidly growing interest in 238U/235U measurements, and researchers hope to greatly expand the set of studied compounds. <br/> -Uranium is a redox-sensitive metal in the surface environment, and the basis of the most precise geochronometers. Its isotopic behavior is therefore of broad interest to Earth Scientists, but is poorly understood. Uranium is a strong candidate for theoretical study of mass-independent fractionation because it has the highest atomic number of any element with more than one long-lived, nonradiogenic isotope. It is thus expected to show the largest nuclear field shift effect of any element. This hypothesis is supported by theoretical and empirical evidence that the field shift effect on isotope fractionation between oxidized U(VI) and reduced U(IV) species overwhelms a mass-dependent fractionation in the opposite direction, leading to high 238U/235U in chemically reduced phases such as black shales. Uranium is also a good target for investigation because its elemental neighbor neptunium (Np)has the best-studied Mssbauer isotope among the actinide elements, 237Np. Isomer shifts measured by Mssbauer spectroscopy directly probe the chemical and geochemical parameters that control nuclear field shift isotope fractionation, so study of analogous Np- and U-bearing species provides a robust check on the accuracy of the theoretical method.<br/> -This project aims to establish theoretical methods to predict isotope signatures in all elements suspected to display mass-independent nuclear field shift isotope fractionations, without being restricted to very time consuming calculations on small gas-phase molecules. The integration of electronic structure modeling with Mssbauer spectroscopy could allow investigators to leverage the existing literature, and may stimulate interdisciplinary studies via targeted Mssbauer or near-resonant synchotron X-ray studies of phases where measurements are presently lacking."
0.22,"Many nuclear processes in our universe occur under extreme conditions in supernovae and neutron stars. The properties of nuclei and nuclear matter under these conditions, which are difficult or impossible to reproduce in the laboratory, must necessarily be calculated theoretically. These data are needed to understand astrophysically important systems and processes such as neutron rich matter, neutron stars, supernovae, and r-process nucleosynthesis and neutrino scattering. The quantum many-particle methods developed within this project have broad applications across many areas of physics. These include the nuclear physics aspects directly relating to the project, cold atomic gas research, and electronic structure. Methods previously developed within this project have been applied in each of these areas. The project will train both undergraduate and graduate students, give them exposure at national and international conferences, and provide for dissemination of the results.<br/><br/>This project will continue work developing and using accurate techniques to calculate the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter using quantum Monte Carlo methods, i.e. stochastic sampling methods for the large number of quantum degrees of freedom. A primary aim is to develop auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo methods to sample both the space and spin-isospin degrees of freedom of protons and neutrons in nuclei with all important parts of the nuclear interaction. These include both the spin-orbit and three-body interactions. New wave functions which can be efficiently evaluated for nuclei are being developed, with the goal of obtaining accurate properties for medium to large and neutron rich nuclei. Superfluidity has major consequences in neutron star matter. The investigator and his students will use the same methods to study both the nuclear systems and the related phenomena in cold atomic gases. Many of the pairing and superfluid mechanisms important in nuclei and nuclear matter can be studied and verified in these systems where detailed experimental measurements can be made using table-top experimental setups."
0.351747,"In this project scientists will search for new, very weak forces between atoms. The current understanding of physics and cosmology allows for the possibility that in addition to the four known fundamental forces there may be additional weak forces due to the existence of new particles. To search for such forces the group supported by the present grant will perform very sensitive experiments on atoms using a variant of the technique that underlies MRI medical scanners (nuclear magnetic resonance). In the proposed experiments the group will orient the nuclear spins of atoms using lasers and watch how the spin orientation changes with time. They expect to improve the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude compared with earlier experiments. In addition to allowing the scientists to search for new forces between atoms, the proposed experiments will also have practical applications for very sensitive measurements of magnetic fields and for precision navigation.<br/><br/>The proposal describes a program of precision measurements based on high-sensitivity nuclear spin magnetometers. In one part of the program an existing alkali-metal noble-gas co-magnetometer will be used to set new limits on several hypothetical spin interactions. A possible interaction between spin and mass can be mediated by axions or other light pseudo-scalar particles. However, existing laboratory experiments searching for this effect have not yet reached a sensitivity that is competitive with astrophysical limits. One of the proposed experiments will improve these limits by more than 3 orders of magnitude and reach, for the first time, an unexplored range of parameter space. Another type of interaction that can be mediated by hypothetical light particles is a non-magnetic spin-spin interaction. Recent limits on such electron spin interactions can be improved by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude using already existing experimental apparatus. Another part of the program is focused on development of a new type of spin co-magnetometer, using two noble gas nuclear spin species and an alkali-metal readout with a Ramsey pulse interrogation. It is designed to have a higher accuracy as well as better precision compared with existing approaches. The sensitivity of the new co-magnetometer is already sufficient to realize a search for spin-gravity interaction with energy sensitivity at the Planck scale. The group's efforts will focus on the control of systematic effects in this experiment."
0.439999,"A primary challenge of Nuclear Physics today is to understand the internal structure of hadrons and their complex interactions as they emerge from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong force. The objective of this project is to explore the effects of chiral dynamics on hadron spectrum and structure. In particular, I will focus on electromagnetic polarizabilites, the masses of the lightest hadrons and the behavior of dense nuclear matter at high temperature. To investigate the properties of quarks in the energy region where hadrons are the dominant excitations, I will use a numerical approach, lattice QCD. <br/><br/>On the educational side, I am developing a seminar series, ""Modern Physics for Science Teachers"" and an undergraduate ""Computational Physics"" course. The seminars will be designed to help teachers connect the K-12 science curriculum to modern Physics research. The seminar series will constitute a valuable educational opportunity to science teachers and local K-12 students, in a area where the socio-economic and educational indicators are particularly low. <br/><br/>From a broader perspective, this project is part of an effort to understand the properties of visible matter in the universe. Complementing a rigorous experimental effort, my research explores the properties of nuclear particles as predicted by QCD. This will help answer questions relating to the composition of the early universe, exotic phases of matter inside neutron stars, charge distributions inside hadrons, origin of nuclear forces, etc. A significant part of my research involves developing numerical methods for QCD that exploit the tremendous computing power of graphics cards (GPUs). The expertise gained in using GPUs to solve nuclear physics problems will have direct applicability to all scientific and engineering fields that use finite-difference methods."
0.219393,"The study of nuclear interactions and properties from the underlying theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) represents a central goal in nuclear physics research. At low energies, however, QCD becomes non-linear and strongly interacting, eluding first-principle pencil-and-paper calculations of nuclear properties. An important aspect of nuclear physics at low energy is the physics associated with weakly bound systems. Some properties of such systems are universally shared across atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The effective field theory (EFT) formulation allows for systematic calculations of nuclear properties that are deeply rooted in QCD. EFT allows reliable error estimates in calculations that are otherwise difficult to estimate in phenomenological approaches. In the supported research work, EFT for few-body systems involving electromagnetic radiation would be constructed. Key reactions involving light nuclei that are relevant in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and stellar burning would be studied. Some of these reactions play an important role in interpreting experimental results probing physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The proposed work would also introduce new model-independent tools with reliable error estimates to study halo nuclei. These nuclei are described as a tightly bound core with usually one or two valence neutrons forming a halo. This research ties in with planned major U.S. investment in rare isotope beam experiments. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the research include training of physics graduate students in numerical and analytical work for an academic or industry career benefiting society. Results from this research work would be incorporated in a graduate course. Atomic physics research would also be affected by this study of weakly bound few-body systems due to the universality described above. Atomic systems with large scattering lengths form an active field of theoretical and experimental research."
0.12,"The research funded by this award is designed to promote a better understanding of atomic nuclei, the basic building blocks of all normal matter in the Universe. How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature? Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these? To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions. One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences. The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.<br/><br/>The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier. Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems. These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC). A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL. <br/><br/>In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons. This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics. Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements. The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND. <br/><br/>The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force."
0.201,"This Major Research Instrumentation award will enable the installation of a large acceptance, high-resolution magnetic spectrograph at the John D. Fox Accelerator Laboratory of Florida State University (FSU) and the development of a suite of state-of-the-art auxiliary detectors around it. This instrument will allow precision measurements of certain nuclear properties, which determine the energy release and time scale of stellar explosions and studies of the physics of unbound atomic nuclei in general. This instrument reclaims the capability to perform such precision measurements in the USA. <br/><br/>This collaborative MRI award will fund the installation of a large-acceptance, high-resolution Enge split-pole spectrograph (SPS) at the accelerator laboratory at FSU with the purpose of studying the physics of resonant nuclear states that impact nuclear astrophysics and nuclear structure. The SPS became available upon the cessation of operations at the Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale University. This project will install the 32-tonne instrument at FSU and augment its research capabilities by upgrading its focal plane detectors and developing a new Silicon detector array, in parallel at Louisiana State University (LSU), for efficient spectroscopy of unbound resonances.<br/><br/>The properties of un-bound nuclear states, or resonances, have become a focal point of present day nuclear science as they present the doorway through which stars and stellar explosions build up the elements and release energy. The LSU/FSU collaboration previously developed the Array for Nuclear Astrophysics and Structure with Exotic Beams (ANASEN) for high-efficiency studies of such reactions using beams of radioactive nuclei. A new opportunity for advancing our understanding of nuclear reactions with astrophysical importance stems from the unique combination of high-precision spectroscopy performed with the SPS with the existing program of high-sensitivity studies with radioactive beams currently being performed with ANASEN.<br/><br/>The proposed SPS system also creates an important discovery potential for the physics of exotic nuclear states, studied through a systematic investigation of particle orbitals beyond the binding limit. The interaction of nuclear orbits across shell closures is of importance to the physics of exotic nuclei at the limits of binding. The modification of nuclear properties through the presence of extended wavefunctions will be studied through a detailed spectroscopy of un-bound resonances, studying the presence of the Super-radiance mechanism in the presence of competing particle-decay channels. Again, the research at the SPS is not only complementary, but important to current and future studies with radioactive beams at FSU and the future Facility for Rare isotope Beams (FRIB).<br/><br/>The proposed program around the SPS is a complementary effort and aims to address a lack of experimental opportunities with stable nuclear beams within the U.S. scientific program. Operated by a collaboration of two vibrant research groups, the SPS has the potential to become a national resource in the education of the next generation of scientists."
0.284233,"The development of novel methods in nuclear many-body theory is critical for the study of phenomena at the frontiers of astrophysics, mesoscopic science, fundamental physics and technology. As a mesoscopic system, the atomic nucleus reveals the transition from the macroscopic world, with pronounced statistical regularities, to the microscopic world, where individual quantum states can be identified and studied. In this project, using the atomic nucleus as a research laboratory, powerful theoretical methods will be developed for the study of generic properties of many-body systems, such as shell structure, superfluidity and superconductivity, particle decay and radiation, the onset of chaotic dynamics and its interplay with collective motion. The project puts a strong emphasis on the development of cross-disciplinary theoretical methods with applicability to various strongly-correlated many-body systems. Applications of these methods provide insights in a variety of nuclear physics phenomena, such as beta decay, charge-exchange reactions, electron capture, two-neutrino and neutrino-less double beta decay, and the weak interaction processes. The work pursued here will support in part the experimental programs concerning the physics of stable and exotic nuclei at radioactive beam facilities.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed work is to find self-consistent high-precision solutions of the nuclear many-body problem, where masses, matter and charge distributions, spectra, decay and reaction rates can be calculated within the same framework at zero and finite temperatures. The mathematical apparatus for the generalized covariant response theory will be advanced beyond the existing formulation by means of Green's function techniques, involving extra dimensions accounting for nuclear superfluidity effects. The effects of coupling between single-particle and emergent collective degrees of freedom, coupling to the continuum and the formation of bubbles, skins and other exotic geometries will be included on equal footing. The project helps to answer fundamental questions, such as: What is the origin of chemical elements? Where are the limits of nuclear stability? What are the masses of neutrinos? The developed approach will allow for the consistent astrophysical modeling of such competing processes as beta-decay and neutron capture, and thereby remove the ambiguities arising from the nuclear physics input. This project will provide students with an intensive training of their analytical and numerical skills, serving as a basis for their future careers in industry and academia."
0.5219,"The research proposed here is primarily for two projects. The first is a search for a type of particle known as a scalar meson, which has the same quantum numbers as a theoretical particle called the ""glueball"". The latter is conjectured to be a bound system of only gluons, which are the force-carrying particles in the theory of QCD (quantum chromodynamics). In practice, real particles are a quantum-mechanical mixture of scalar mesons and the hypothetical glueball, so studying the properties of the scalar mesons gives a direct connection with the predictions of QCD. Scalar mesons have been observed in some hadron-beam experiments, but there is scant evidence of these mesons in photon-beam experiments like the ones proposed at Jefferson Lab. This research project will provide definitive results on scalar meson rates produced at the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. The second project is a hadronic-beam experiment to be carried out at the J-PARC facility in Japan. This experiment will explore the production rate of final states where two pi-mesons are detected. The last data of this sort was taken back in the 1970s, and now precise data for this final state are needed as input to theoretical calculations of nucleon resonances. A nucleon resonance is an excited state of the proton, which can decay into a proton and one or more pi-mesons (or other particles). The nucleon resonance spectrum is important because it tells us about how quarks interact with each other inside the proton. The nucleon resonance spectrum can now be calculated using a theoretical technique called lattice QCD, which is based on the theory of QCD.<br/><br/>Understanding the theory of QCD (quantum chromodynamics) is one of the most important aspects of nuclear physics today. QCD is responsible for the binding of quarks inside the proton, and also for the binding of protons and neutrons inside the nucleus. Hence, QCD is essentially the theory that leads to a better understanding of nuclear energy and other nuclear applications. While today's applications of nuclear processes, such as nuclear medicine, can be understood in terms of phenomenology, the applications of the future may well depend on an understanding of QCD. Calculations based on the theory of QCD are difficult, requiring large computers, and such complex calculations need to be tested experimentally. The research proposed here is one such experimental test that can lead to a better understanding of the nuclear force. Other broader impacts resulting from this research are the training of graduate students in building leading-edge instrumentation and in computational analysis."
0.12,"The research funded by this award is designed to promote a better understanding of atomic nuclei, the basic building blocks of all normal matter in the Universe. How did they form following the Big Bang, and how do they now interact to change their basic elemental nature? Are there new forms of matter made up from very exotic types of atomic nuclei and how might we make and study these? To this end the group will develop special new techniques in nuclear science, as well as train future scientists that can help answer some of these questions. One important training component will be a continuation of the well-established and highly successful outreach to faculty and students at New Buffalo High School in Michigan that has introduced these students to interesting, important, and exciting careers in the sciences. The technology developed and used in this research will have applications in other important areas, such as homeland security (nuclear terrorism), the safe storage and monitoring of nuclear wastes, and applications in nuclear medicine, including radiation therapy. The latter includes a new modality directly related to this research: the production and imaging of ion beams to treat particular forms of cancer tumors. Nearly 50% of graduate students and other personnel trained in the group's past research projects are currently pursuing careers in nuclear security or nuclear medicine, and it is anticipated that this will continue as a result of the present grant.<br/><br/>The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing stable as well as short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate such studies. This includes use of the TwinSol low-energy radioactive ion-beam facility in operation at the University of Notre Dame (ND), developed jointly by the University of Michigan (UM) and ND. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability to elucidate the effect that the exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on fusion, transfer, inelastic excitation, and breakup probabilities near the Coulomb barrier. Of particular interest here is the influence that higher-order couplings to and within the continuum have on the various reaction mechanisms, since proximity to the continuum is the characteristic defining feature of weakly-bound systems. These studies will be carried out at TwinSol in collaboration with a group from the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), utilizing a prototype active-target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC). A related program will use the full AT-TPC recently commissioned at the reaccelerated beam facility (ReA3) at NSCL. <br/><br/>In addition, the UM-UND collaboration, under the primary direction of the UM research group and their colleagues, will continue advanced development and application of deuterated scintillators for nuclear measurements involving neutrons. This will include selected measurements of (d,n) and (3He,n) reactions involving both stable and unstable beams, and in particular 7Be(d,n) which is of interest in astrophysics. Since these detectors permit neutron spectroscopy and cross section measurements without neutron time-of-flight, they have a particular advantage when used with the high-intensity, low-energy, non-pulsed accelerators suitable for nuclear astrophysics measurements. The latter includes the new 5 MV accelerator recently installed at ND and we will pursue such experiments, and in particular several key (A,n) measurements, together with the nuclear astrophysics group at ND. <br/><br/>The unique neutron detector array the group has recently developed has potential for wide-spread applications both in nuclear science as well as in homeland-security and nuclear non-proliferation. As in the past, the proposed work will involve graduate and undergraduate students from ND and UM, together with faculty members and students from several primarily undergraduate schools located in close proximity to these universities. The highly-technical nature of the proposed research will thus contribute significantly to the training of a technically-literate work force."
0.265,"This project focuses on a fundamental research challenge of modern nuclear physics, namely to understand the structure and interactions of the basic building blocks of the visible matter, protons and neutrons known collectively as nucleons, in terms of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong forces in nature. Nucleons, are composed of a variety of quarks confined by the quanta of the strong nuclear fields known as gluons. In order to explore the nucleon structure we perform electron scattering experiments where sophisticated particle detectors are utilized as powerful microscopes in order to determine the detailed dynamics of quark constituents. This in turn provides an important input for testing and understanding QCD.<br/><br/>This project involves four experimental activities, three of which will take place at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) while the fourth one will occur at the MAMI Microtron in Mainz, Germany. At TJNAF, first, a high precision measurement of the nucleon excitation to the Delta resonance will shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the presence of non-spherical components in the nucleon wave-function, with an emphasis on the role of the pion cloud to the nucleon dynamics. Second, in a separate experiment we will explore deep inelastic electron scattering off triton (2 neutrons + 1 proton) and helium-3 (1 neutron + 2 protons) mirror nuclei to determine the ratio of the up over down valence quark momentum distributions in a free proton, and advance our understanding of the effect of the nuclear medium on these momentum distributions. Third, a measurement of the J/Psi meson electroproduction cross section near threshold off a proton will enable us to explore the non-perturbative gluonic interaction between the J/Psi and the proton. This measurement might reveal an enhancement of the cross section just above threshold which could be indicative of the important role conformal anomaly contribution plays in QCD.<br/><br/>At the MAMI Microtron, the first high precision measurement of the Virtual Compton Scattering reaction on the nucleon resonance will allow the investigation of the electric generalized polarizability of the proton, meaning how stiffly the nucleon responds to an external electric field. The experiment will also allow for the first exploration of the nucleon excitation through a purely electromagnetic photon channel.<br/><br/>The project will enhance the infrastructure for research by building instrumentation for nuclear physics experiments, primarily at TJNAF, and by supporting international collaborative research efforts. The research activities will also contribute to science education by providing topics for PhD theses in nuclear physics, thus training a new generation of nuclear scientists. Furthermore, the opportunities for training students at the undergraduate level with hands on hardware experience will advance nuclear science education, which is essential to ensure a broad, basic knowledge of nuclear science in society."
0.018967,"Life on Earth traces its origins back to a single common ancestor that lived nearly four billion years ago. Yet today, life has diversified into tens of millions of species. Reconstructing these evolutionary relationships is the aim of phylogenetics, and its insights are critical to nearly all areas of biology. The genomics revolution is radically altering the historically data-limited field of molecular phylogenetics and genome-scale data are now easily generated for any organism. Yet, simply collecting more genetic data, on its own, will not be sufficient to resolve difficult branches on the Tree of Life because some genes will support different evolutionary histories than others. This project addresses the questions of which genes and which DNA positions in those genes are most informative for resolving deep amphibian relationships, and conversely, which may be misleading. Amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are an ancient and diverse group typifying many of the difficulties of reconstructing deep phylogeny. The relationships among the three amphibian orders have proven one of the most difficult portions of the vertebrate phylogeny to resolve. This work may serve as a general framework for tackling thorny problems in phylogenetics and builds important avenues for graduate training in bioinformatics, high-throughput sequencing analysis, and model-based phylogenetic reconstruction - key skills in this post-genomic era. The research will integrate undergraduate researchers from traditionally under-represented groups across rural Appalachia and Kentucky. This research is of broad interest to evolutionary biologists working on amphibians, and stands to make important contributions to amphibian systematics. It addresses questions about how we analyze genomic data to accurately reconstruct deep evolutionary relationships.<br/><br/> The researchers will test hypotheses about the source of conflicting phylogenetic signals from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes by analyzing site-specific patterns of topological support across nuclear genes that interact with the mitochondrion and ribosomes. The researchers will use a well-developed amphibian system in which previous analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes, nuclear ribosomal RNA, and >300 putatively neutral nuclear exons have each strongly supported conflicting scenarios for basal amphibian divergences. This project tests the hypothesis that mitochondrial and ribosomal genes and their nuclear-encoded functional counterparts support the same tree topologies due to compensatory co-evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Leveraging genomic resources, the researchers will develop a targeted capture kit to sequence multiple exons of 225 nuclear genes that functionally interact with the mitochondrion and ribosomes in 144 amphibian taxa, representing each major lineage. Examining the relative support for different inter-ordinal topologies across sites in each locus, and with knowledge of which portions of these nuclear loci physically interact with rRNA or mitochondrial-encoded proteins, this project will test whether particular nuclear-encoded genes yield conflicting topologies because of constraints on organellar structure and function."
0.299106,"The Hope College Nuclear Group is studying neutron-rich unstable nuclei near the drip-line with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and Large area multi-Institutional Scintillation Array (LISA) at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and is applying a variety of nuclear techniques (e.g. Particle Induced X-Ray Emission, Rutherford BackScattering, Nuclear Reaction Analysis, and Ion Beam Induced Luminescence) to a range of interdisciplinary questions with the Hope Ion Beam Analysis Laboratory (HIBAL). In addition, work to harvest isotopes with medical and stewardship applications is moving from development to production. This award supports two faculty in both of these efforts, each of whom will include undergraduate researchers in all aspects of the research.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students and faculty are investigating unstable neutron-rich nuclei to refine the theoretical understanding of light, neutron-rich nuclei. The group is measuring the excited states of 9He and the ground state of 13Be with the MoNA/LISA/Sweeper system at the NSCL. The interdisciplinary portion of the research involves developing techniques to harvest isotopes of strategic and medical interest at the NSCL and future Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and examining, with HIBAL, metalloprotein stoichiometry, forensic characterization of layered automotive paints, forensic comparison of auto glass fragments, and luminescence studies of feldspars and carbonates. Collaborators include other Hope researchers (characterizing structured nanomaterials) and groups outside Hope College (metal contamination in sediment, river sediment origins, and flame retardants). All of these initiatives are important for the specific science result they yield and for possible far-reaching impact on the analytical techniques used in many areas. The Hope College Nuclear Group has demonstrated its ability to carry out similar research for a number of years, and the new experiments are designed to match our interests and abilities.<br/><br/>Additionally, this project has a significant impact on a large number of undergraduate researchers. Experience shows that undergraduate research enhances a student's education and better prepares the student for graduate work or for a wide variety of STEM careers in either industry or academia."
0.422821,"The present CAREER award integrates research and educational components focused on the understanding of nuclear properties and their application to the interdisciplinary field of nuclear astrophysics. The main focus of the research is to address the question: How were the heavy elements made? The research component aims at the study of the decay properties of exotic nuclei utilizing the technique of Total Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS). Measurements will focus on nuclei along the rapid-neutron-capture process (or r-process), which is believed to be responsible for the origin of half of the heavy elements. The measurements will build on the previous experience of the PI in the development and use of a Total Absorption Spectrometer and will utilize existing equipment at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory together with the implementation of new proposed equipment, in this case a tape transport system for the removal of background activity from the detection area.<br/><br/>The technical focus of the research is through the measurement of beta-decay strength distributions of nuclei along the astrophysical r-process. The beta-decay strength distribution is the only reliable parameter for constraining the theoretical models used in r-process calculations and improving their predictive power. <br/><br/>The PI will also establish a unique, new one-week summer school for rising juniors in the area of nuclear physics. The school will be available to 12 students each summer and provide hands-on laboratory activities as well as instruction in nuclear physics. Students from schools that do not offer an undergraduate course in nuclear physics will benefit from this summer school. Ultimately it is important to increase the number of graduate students in the field of low-energy nuclear structure physics, which is important not only for the basic science addressed, but as a training ground for skilled workers in critical areas of homeland security."
0.48,"This project continues an interdisciplinary program to develop fundamental theories of many-particle systems, ranging from ultradense nuclear matter in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and in neutron stars to ultracold atomic and condensed matter systems. Nuclear theory will be applied to study the properties of matter formed under extreme conditions of temperatures and pressures, to matter in neutron stars, with the aim of understanding observations and experiment and, conversely, using observations of neutron stars to learn properties of matter under extreme conditions. This research makes important interdisciplinary connections between nuclear and QCD problems and cold atom systems and will apply expertise in quantum fluids to predict the behavior of dilute helium solutions used in the proposed experiment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source to detect the electric dipole moment of the neutron.<br/><br/>Understanding new states of matter and connections between them provides broad intellectual insights into the basic properties of matter ranging from the hottest to the coldest many-particle systems in the universe. By integrating students and post-doctoral fellows into a diverse program that crosses the traditional boundaries between nuclear, particle, condensed matter and atomic physics, the PI and his colleagues provide unique opportunities for young researchers to think and create across disciplines. The scientists trained in this program have generally gone on to have significant impact in research at U.S. universities and national laboratories, as well as abroad."
0.386738,"Introduction<br/><br/>This research project will analyze and communicate important societal issues having to do with the disposal of nuclear waste. Unlike the vast majority of scholarly inquiries, which culminate in journal articles or a book, this inquiry will result in a feature length documentary about the scientific, political, and ethical issues adjacent to the problem of the socially responsible disposal of nuclear waste. Though the reach of the film will extend beyond any particular site, the focal point of the study is the only fully-licensed, operating geological repository for nuclear waste in the world: the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant twenty-six miles east of Carlsbad, New Mexico.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The project will track the contentious history of current and planned clean-up operations involving the Pilot Plant. It will depict a disputed, sometimes successful and sometimes failed, trading zone for very different (often antagonistic) stakeholders from experts, to townspeople, politicians, miners, activists, industrial engineers, and futurists. Trading-zone studies, a methodological approach within the research area known as Science and Technology Studies (STS), interrogate subcultures confronting one another and developing coordinated local action where global agreement is often absent. In this trading-zone study, the investigator is ethically, visually, and methodologically committed to depicting that collision as all sides struggle to shape an contested nuclear future. The use of film as a medium for presenting the results of the trading-zone study is innovative and potentially transformative; it could open a way for STS to investigate in a visual way the making of science and technology policy.<br/><br/>Potential Broader Impact<br/><br/>This project will reach a broad audience by partnering with outreach organizations, Film Sprout and Working Films, to bring the film to its core audience: policy makers, environmentalists, along with groups and citizens traditionally not positioned to participate in science policy. Target locales and groups include science museums such as the Bradbury Science Museum (Los Alamos), the Atomic Testing Museum (Las Vegas), The Museum of Science and Industry (Albuquerque), nuclear facilities, towns surrounding them, and environmental groups."
0.374383,"Atomic nuclei occurring in nature tend to have the same number of neutrons and protons. For larger nuclear masses, this is attributed to the symmetry energy, a contribution to the nuclear energy associated with neutron-proton imbalance, that becomes larger the larger the imbalance. Nuclei with large imbalance can decay to more energetically favored products and, when that imbalance is excessive, the nuclei cannot even be formed. Understanding the symmetry energy is essential for extrapolating from the properties of existing nuclei to neutron stars kept stable by gravity while at the verge of collapse to black holes. In their efforts, the inverstigators will rely on their complementary expertise and will benefit from the expertise in nuclear structure of other members of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) Nuclear Theory Group and from the expertise in nuclear astrophysics of the members of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA), housed partly at Michigan State University.<br/><br/>This project will advance our understanding of nuclear reactions, emphasizing aspects pertaining to the so-called nuclear symmetry energy. The symmetry energy governs average evolution of nuclear properties with neutron-proton imbalance that is now easier to vary experimentally given the modern existing and planned accelerators that can accelerate short-lived isotopes. The symmetry energy is important for extrapolating from the properties of the nuclei to those of neutron stars. The latter are macroscopic nuclear systems made stable, right at the verge of collapse into a black hole, by opposing forces of gravity and pressure tied to the dependence of symmetry energy on nuclear density. The symmetry energy at densities higher than normal for nuclei is studied using observables from central collisions of heavy nuclei, in particular charged pion ratios and collective flow. The investigators will improve on theoretical descriptions of those central collisions, by incorporating dynamic production of alpha particles into transport theory for the collisions. Because of large binding energy per nucleon and equal proton and neutron numbers, alpha particles are, on one hand, rather copiously produced and, on the other, they significantly change relative neutron-proton imbalance in their surroundings; hence their importance. The symmetry energy at normal and subnormal densities will be studied by simultaneously interpreting data from elastic scattering and charge exchange reactions, thus learning about differences in the neutron and proton distributions in those nuclei that have neutron-proton imbalance. Finally, the investigators will extract optical potentials of neutrons and protons from many-body theory relying on fundamental interactions, paying particular attention to the dependence of those potentials on neutron-proton imbalance. The fundamental extraction can help to reduce ambiguities in the interpretations of peripheral reaction experiments."
0.27,"The goal of the award is to devise efficient computational methods for performing risk and safety analyses of nuclear power plants. A recent international effort of the Nuclear Energy Agency formulated a new framework, known as risk-informed safety-margin characterization, to address several critical issues facing the nuclear industry today. The impacts of these developments, which include extending licenses for aging facilities and operating them at higher power levels, can profoundly affect safety margins, and there is an urgent need to better understand the risks in the changes. Indeed, the catastrophic 2011 accident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan clearly shows the utmost importance of accurately measuring risk. In addition to performing efficient nuclear safety analyses, the techniques may also be applied to attack problems in civil and mechanical engineering, catastrophe modeling, and finance.<br/><br/>This research combines theoretical and practical components, including designing new Monte Carlo algorithms, formally establishing their validity, and implementing them to analyze risks of existing nuclear plants. The core of the work will focus on variance-reduction techniques for efficient simulation for performing risk and safety analyses of nuclear facilities. Because current simulations can require enormous computational effort, applying variance reduction is essential for performing safety analyses. If successful, the new methods will profoundly reduce computation time, perhaps by orders of magnitude. To further account for the statistical error of the resulting estimators, the investigator also plans to produce asymptotically valid confidence intervals."
0.226605,"The cell nuclear envelope is the physical barrier between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The envelope regulates gene expression by allowing the access of proteins to DNA through passageways called nuclear pores. The nuclear envelope is unique in that it has two lipid bilayers (not one as is the case with cell membranes). The bilayers are maintained at a regular (and large) distance of nearly 45 nm. How these two bilayers are maintained at that regular spacing, and how they fuse together to form nuclear pores are current open questions in biology; this award is focused on answering these questions. By discovering an explanation for protein-mediated control of bilayer separation, this research will ultimately help develop new strategies for treating diseases that have been linked to mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins. The research program will provide opportunities to recruit outstanding students from underrepresented groups at the University of Houston (UH) and the University of Florida (UF). The findings of the research will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations and graduate and undergraduate courses at UH and UF.<br/><br/>This award will promote a collaborative partnership between investigators involving experiments, modeling and simulations to elucidate the fundamental physics that underlies nuclear lipid bilayer structure. The experimental work will discover how SUN proteins, which are conserved across different eukaryotic cell types and link the nucleus to the cytoskeleton maintain lipid bilayer structure and integrity. Theoretical work will seek to interpret the experimental findings in the framework of continuum mechanics, by computing the energetics of bilayer separation and fusion. The numerical and experimental findings will be used together to explain the mechanism of bilayer separation."
0.495,"Nuclear astrophysics is the application of nuclear physics knowledge obtained from laboratory studies to the universe and its contents. This is essential for understanding how the chemical elements are produced, the ways stars are powered, what causes exploding stars called supernovae, the origin of cosmic rays, and more. A key research frontier is based on using neutrinos, subatomic particles that have no electric charge and very little mass, and which barely interact with matter. This makes neutrinos hard to detect, but allows them to escape from and thus reveal physical conditions in the deep interiors of astrophysical objects. The unique information they carry will help resolve longstanding questions in nuclear astrophysics. Research is needed to further develop detection techniques and to draw conclusions from the data. There is high demand for students and postdocs trained in this research area. The topics covered, which also include black holes, dark matter, and the universe itself, capture the imagination of the public and attract young people to explore careers in science. <br/><br/>This project is intended to lead to significant gains in our understanding of astrophysical objects and neutrinos themselves. The knowledge of theoretical physics and astrophysics will be applied to help lead to new detections of astrophysical neutrinos and to develop new understandings from that data. A central focus of this project is on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, the cosmic flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by the explosions of massive stars over the past several billion years. This flux has not been detected yet, but it is within reach, and careful work is needed to help isolate this faint signal. Related topics include detecting other astrophysical neutrino sources, the nature of supernovae, and the properties of neutrinos. Junior scientists supported by the grant will be mentored in the full range of skills needed to be successful in their future careers. To maximize broader impacts, the work integrates efforts in research, mentoring, teaching, and outreach, with a focus on underrepresented populations, including the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.<br/><br/>This award is supported jointly by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Division of Physics, the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities."

0.353,"Nuclear Science is tasked with answering questions such as: (i) How did matter come into being and how does it evolve? (ii) How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? (iii) How can the knowledge and technology progress provided by nuclear physics best be used to benefit society? Providing answers to these questions depends on a detailed theoretical understanding of nuclear reactions, a field in which current approaches are either outdated or limited to a small number of applications. In this larger context, this project will focus on the theoretical study of deuteron-induced reactions. Due to the short lifetimes involving exotic nuclei, direct neutron capture measurements of relevance to the origin of the heavy elements are often not possible. Indirect techniques like deuteron induced reactions are a common tool to extract the relevant astrophysical rates. These reactions are part of ongoing experimental programs at radioactive beam facilities, as well as programs at future facilities such as the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). As such, this project will provide theoretical support to challenging experimental programs and will provide a unique training opportunity for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.<br/><br/>A reliable reaction theory is critical for the understanding the data produced at experimental programs using (d,p) reactions. From a theoretical perspective, (d,p) reactions are attractive because the scattering can be reduced to an effective three-body problem. One of the most challenging aspects of solving the three-body problems for nuclear reactions is posed by the repulsive Coulomb interaction. While for light nuclei the momentum-space Faddeev equations can be treated by screening the Coulomb force, a similar approach is difficult to implement for heavy systems. Indeed, for most of the new exotic nuclei to be produced at FRIB, currently available computational methods are not adequate. This project will address this critical need and provide an implementation of an exact Faddeev method for the three-body nuclear reaction problem, in which the Coulomb force will be treated without screening."

0.07,"Many important reactions in nuclear physics cannot be measured with currently available experimental techniques. For example, the reaction probability of the process in which two protons fuse to form a Deuteron (a bound state of a neutron and a proton) is an important process in the sun, but cannot be measured experimentally; only theoretical calculations can provide this rate. In the absence of guidance from experiment, it becomes important to quantify theoretical uncertainties. This project will address these issues for specific reactions. Analytical and numerical calculations will be used to determine reaction rates for astrophysically-relevant reaction rates, and new parametrizations of the internuclear interaction will be provided. Specifically, the PI and his students will use interactions that have been constructed using a theoretical tool known as effective field theory. This tool is an expansion that can be systematically improved by introducing, in a controlled manner, additional parameters to increase the accuracy of the interaction model. Numerical techniques will be used to determine the intrinsic error of this approach, parametrize the interaction, and calculate the reaction rates for selected processes. A quantification of resulting uncertainties will improve our understanding of the internuclear interaction. This project will also provide an excellent training ground for graduate and undergraduate students and will contribute to a needed workforce in those technologies that rely on nuclear physics, which are relevant to security, energy and the health care sector. Graduate students will become familiarized with numerical methods that can be useful when working in industry.<br/><br/>This project follows a two-prong strategy that aims at improving our understanding of weak processes using effective field theory. Firstly, a number of weak processes in few-nucleon systems will be calculated within the unified framework of the so-called pionless effective field theory. Specifically, the well-measured decay half-life time of tritium will be treated and used to fix a parameter that within this framework is required for a high-accuracy of proton-proton fusion and weak proton capture on Helium-3. The second prong will focus on understanding the intrinsic error of Hamiltonians and associated electroweak currents generated with the so-called pionfull effective field theory. The PI will use novel numerical optimization/fitting techniques to establish an ordering scheme for the chiral potential and the associated electroweak currents that reflects the intrinsic error of the Hamiltonian order-by-order. Together with his collaborators, the PI will then use these results to calculate observables such as half-life times or total decay rates to new accuracy and with correct error estimates. The resulting interactions and currents will be made available to the nuclear theory community."
0.361428,"The focus of our research is to investigate nuclear-hadronic dynamics with a particular emphasis on its relation to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of quarks and gluons. Of particular interest is studying the role of chiral symmetry, which is one of the basic symmetries of QCD. The effective field theory named chiral perturbation theory offers a systematic and practical framework to translate the symmetries of QCD into those of hadrons, particles that actually constitute atomic nuclei. The proposed research makes extensive use of this formalism. To describe those phenomena that are at present beyond the applicability of chiral perturbation theory, models are used that approximately reflect the symmetries of QCD and that can be applied to complex nuclei. Specifically, it is proposed to study: eonsequences of nuclear chiral perturbation theory as applied to few-nucleon systems; effective-field-theoretical estimation of radiative corrections for weak processes in few-nucleon systems and systematic improvements of the existing theoretical treatments of the muon-deuteron capture reaction and neutrino-deuteron reactions; nuclear chiral perturbation theory applied to inelastic reactions involving rather high energy-momentum transfers; and neutrino-deuteron reactions beyond the pion-production threshold. <br/><br/>The effective field theory approach is known to be highly useful in our attempt to relate the properties of atomic nuclei to the underlying dynamics of the quarks and gluons. Our investigations not only deepen the understanding of nuclear-hadron physics but also have important bearing upon nuclear astrophysics and search for physics beyond the standard model. Our study has particularly close connections with the on-going and future neutrino experiments that are meant to look for signals for non-standard physics. The budget allows us to hire a post-doctoral fellow and an undergraduate student to join our research effort."
0.064191,"The main goal of this program is to advance the understanding of the fundamental nature of atomic nuclei, with undergraduate student participation as an integral component. The principle investigator and team of undergraduate students will investigate the structure of light neutron-rich atomic nuclei that do not exist naturally in nature but must be produced at an accelerator facility. Understanding these nuclei is important for advancing our understanding of how the protons and the neutrons bind together in nuclear systems that are very near the limits of existence. As the research program advances to the study of heavier nuclei, results will provide important information for the understanding of explosive astrophysical environments such as supernovae and neutron star mergers. Much of the research will be conducted at Westmont College, which includes student training in and the use of instrumentation and data analysis techniques, and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University, where students participate in state-of-the-art nuclear physics experiments. Major instrumentation used in experiments include the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), both constructed and tested by undergraduate students from several institutions in the MoNA collaboration. In addition to the science goals, an important goal of this program is to provide transformational research experiences for the participating undergraduate students that can have a positive influence on decisions they make for future study and careers in physics. <br/><br/>The research supported by this award addresses directly some of the main questions driving the field of nuclear science today. Properties of ground and excited states of neutron-rich nuclei will be investigated using the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA), the Large multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA), and the Sweeper Magnet and its associated suite of charged particle detectors, all located at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. Goals of the program include a conclusive measurement of the 10He ground state resonance energy, precise measurement of the 26O ground state lifetime, analysis of the 2-neutron cascade decay of excited states of 24O, and a systematic study of neutron scattering in the MoNA detector bars at the LANSCE facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This research program will help advance knowledge of nuclear structure far from stability, including better understanding of neutron-rich nuclei near the dripline, neutron halo systems, and exotic forms of nuclear decay including multiple neutron decays and 2-neutron radioactivity."
4.574,"Much remains unknown about the origin and evolution of the elements that comprise the universe beyond those created in the Big Bang. Making significant advances in these areas requires investigations at the intersection of nuclear physics and astrophysics. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers (PFC) award the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics - Center for the Evolution of the Elements (JINA-CEE) will focus on answering closely connected open questions related to the origin of the elements and the properties of dense matter probed by neutron stars. JINA-CEE will build on the expertise and technical developments from its past two PFC awards and use innovative laboratory experiments, combined with theoretical and computational approaches, to address the broad range of nuclear physics and astrophysics challenges underlying these science goals. The resulting insights will be integrated into comprehensive physics models of element creation and neutron stars that are then compared to existing and new observational data. JINA-CEE will continue to have educational and research impacts within the nuclear astrophysics community through its interdisciplinary workshop, school, and visitor programs. In addition it will create new multi-institutional graduate course modules and undergraduate course components while reaching out to K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.<br/><br/>The transition from a three element (hydrogen, helium, and lithium) universe, with a small number of isotopes, to a chemically diverse cosmos containing eighty-two long-lived elements with hundreds of isotopes, is significant and not well understood. Neutron star matter plays an important role for the origin of the elements, as it shapes the synthesis of many of the heavy elements in nature produced in core-collapse supernovae and in neutron star mergers. JINA-CEE will explore two closely interrelated questions through experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches: ""How were the elements beyond hydrogen and helium created during the first billion years after the Big Bang?"" and ""What are the properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter and how can it be probed by observations of neutron stars?"""
0.123843,"This award supports research at Augustana College (a small, undergraduate-only, liberal arts institution) to understand the structure of radioactive nuclei that have many excess neutrons. The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU) produces radioactive beams with these excess neutrons. The beams are incident upon a target and the products of the nuclear reactions are measured in a variety of subatomic particle detectors. An important part of the project is the involvement of undergraduate students in these experiments and in development of the necessary detector instrumentation. Undergraduate research experience is important for many future technical careers as well as for graduate school. The funds for this award support the work of the undergraduates and the principle investigator to design and run experiments at NSCL, to analyze data, and to give talks and write papers on the results.<br/><br/>Experiments on exotic nuclear systems are necessary to place constraints on modern theoretical models. The nuclei studied as part of this project are neutron-unbound, which means that a neutron is emitted from a nucleus shortly after formation. Since the nuclei are so unstable, the radioactive nuclear ion beam at NSCL is utilized for these experiments. The charged particle left over after neutron emission is bent by the Sweeper Magnet into a suite of charged particle detectors. The emitted neutron is detected by the MoNA-LISA (Modular Neutron Array and the Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array). The research in this proposal involves data analysis of neutron-unbound nuclear systems and on-going equipment development. New data on the 24O(d,p) reaction will be taken to study negative parity states in 25O. The Augustana-MSU hodoscope, assembled, tested and installed by the Augustana nuclear group, is a key device for this experiment. In addition, the PI will work on the design, construction, and use of a new segmented target system for future experiments."
0.07,"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a successful theory of the strong interaction, the force that binds the nucleus. It can account for the types of quarks and the nuclear charges in the sub-structure of nuclear particles called hadrons. The greatest successes of QCD occur at high energies. At lower energies, the quarks clump together due to a phenomenon known as confinement. The simple picture is that of stationary quarks held by strings of nuclear fields. If a quark is extracted from a hadron, the string stretches and pulls a quark-antiquark pair from the vacuum leading to hadron production. However, nature is more complicated with dynamical quarks bound in hadrons. More experimental information is needed to explain the process of hadron formation. This project is a study of the formation of two hadrons, the omega and f1 mesons. These particles are produced in reactions where a high-energy electron is scattered from nuclei of deuterium, carbon, iron, and lead. The experiments are conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) in Newport News, VA. The Canisius College Medium Energy Nuclear Physics group, led by Dr. Michael Wood, is actively involved at TJNAF. The group will mine the data from an experiment that has already taken place for these mesons. In addition, the group is preparing for a follow-up experiment, which will extend the earlier research to higher beam energy. The undergraduate students involved in the project will gain valuable experience in mining large data sets and develop analysis skills.<br/><br/>The process of hadronization is characterized by two distinct time periods, the propagation time and the formation time. The Canisius College Medium Energy Nuclear Physics (CMENP) group seeks to understand the time frame for a free quark to couple with other quarks (propagation) and to stabilize its color field (formation). Nuclei of different sizes are used to extract these times. The width of the transverse momentum-squared (p2T) varies for nuclei with different sizes, with a greater broadening being associated with a longer propagation time. This project is part of a larger program at Jefferson Lab (JLab) to study long-lived hadrons forming in nuclei. To select the events from the E02-104 experiment at JLab, the data mining software, developed at Old Dominion University, efficiently skims the existing data files and copies the output over the network directly to the CMENP group offsite. The hadrons studied by our collaborators are pions, kaons, protons, and hyperons. The analysis by this group of the omega and f1 mesons and will investigate the mass dependence of hadronization. These results are essential for the interpretation of jet-quenching and proton-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC as well as neutrino interactions with nuclei at energies of a few GeV. This project will be extended to CLAS12. The PCAL software of CLAS12 is needed for the identification of a neutral pion, which exists in the decay of both the omega and f1 mesons. The CMENP group has taken the lead on PCAL software development."
0.02,"Through a set of catalytic activities U.S. scientists at the University of Connecticut and Duke University intend to forge a long-term partnership for studies in nuclear astrophysics with international collaborators in Poland and Romania. The U.S. principal investigator, Moshe Gai, and Henry Weller of Duke University will cooperate with counterparts Wojciech Dominik, at the University of Warsaw, and Ovidiu Tesilean, at the Extreme Light Infrastructure-Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) being constructed near Bucharest. Together, they will prepare the groundwork for new basic research in nuclear astrophysics and use of the gamma-ray beam facility of the ELI-NP in Magurele-Bucharest, Romania. This cooperation aims to leverage significant European Union investments in experimental ELI infrastructure while engaging U.S. expertise in the design of an electronic Time Projection Chamber (eTPC) detector and gas recycling system. For broader impact, breakthroughs that eventually contribute to a high-end gas recycling and purification system could yield ideas for future industrial applications. Because one U.S. postdoctoral student will participate in the early simulations and detector design, other benefits include early career engagement in this forefront U.S.-European teamwork. <br/><br/>If successful, preliminary results should contribute to new concepts for detector technology capable of providing a highly precise determination of an important astrophysical quantity, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in stellar helium burning. This collaboration presents a unique opportunity to link use of a new laser facility and planning for a new detector with a new novel u-v-w electronic Readout, developed in Warsaw for measuring x-ray emissions. After completed construction and with additional research support, results should allow scientists to determine photo nuclear cross sections for center-of-momentum energies lower than those investigated at the High Intensity gamma-ray Source (HIgS) facility in the U.S. The new data obtained can be expected to reduce the ambiguities in the astrophysical S-factors obtained at HIgS and therefore lead to determining a more precise carbon-to-oxygen ratio. The researchers hope that their new method may be applied to other important astrophysical reactions."
0.094807,"The proton is one of the building blocks of everyday matter, with protons in the core of every atom. The proton is in turn made of subnuclear particles known as quarks and gluons. The project supported by this award will improve our understanding of the proton's internal structure, with a focus on the dynamical behavior of the constituent quarks. High-energy particle accelerator facilities at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) will be used to perform the research. A beam of protons will be accelerated to high energy and strike a liquid hydrogen target; the nucleus of a hydrogen atom is comprised of a single proton. Measurement of the particles produced in the collisions will provide information on the behavior of the quarks in their parent protons.<br/><br/>The efforts supported by this award will additionally serve to increase diversity among young scientists trained as nuclear physicists. Training the next generation of nuclear physicists is critical to maintain expertise relevant to the nation's energy and defense needs and to continue advancing both applied and non-applied research in nuclear physics and technology. In each year of this award a student from Mount Holyoke College, an undergraduate institution for women, will be given the opportunity to perform summer research in nuclear physics at Fermilab. Furthermore, this award will provide tuition, salary, and travel support for an African-American graduate student. In addition to supporting his dissertation research, he will receive support to travel once per semester to his alma mater, Howard University, a historically black university, to speak with current physics undergraduates about his experience and progress pursuing a Ph.D. in nuclear physics."
0.688211,"Experiments at rare isotope beam facilities open the door to new regions of exotic nuclei. Data gathered at these facilities is essential for accurate extrapolations of the equation of state of nucleonic matter in density, temperature, and proton fraction and is expected to impact the direct comparison of astrophysical observations with results of sophisticated simulations of neutron stars and supernovae. The projects funded by this award address fundamental theoretical aspects of nuclear physics using effective field theory and renormalization group methods to develop a systematic expansion of nuclear forces and decouple troublesome high-energy contributions from the low-energy parts we want to describe. The results are controlled, model-independent calculations that can exploit efficiently the steady improvements in computing power. <br/><br/>The training received by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates in carrying out the proposed activities contributes directly to the building of a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and numerical computation employed is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research. The emphasis on universal aspects of physical systems, fostered by effective field theory and renormalization group approaches, as well as the direct application of techniques to problems beyond the nuclear domain, leads to enhanced collaborations between disciplines. Broader training in low-energy nuclear theory for both theorists and experimentalists is provided by participation in the TALENT (Training in Advanced Low Energy Nuclear Theory) initiative."

In addition, we play a key role in the production of the HD targets used at Jefferson Lab (JLab).<br/><br/>The HIGS (High Intensity Gamma Source) facility at Duke University is ideal for Compton scattering from both polarized and unpolarized nucleon and nuclear targets. A comprehensive program of Compton scattering is beginning in the fall of 2013 on the proton and neutron, which will extract the electromagnetic polarizabilities with high accuracy. The ongoing program of photofission studies with polarized photons exploits the strong variation of the beam asymmetry in direct neutron production both with beam energy and with target. The proposed measurements provide a database for developing nuclear forensics and expand our understanding of this fundamental nuclear reaction.<br/><br/>The frozen spin HD target (HDIce) will be used in three ""A"" rated experiments at JLab after the facility upgrade. The high purity gas used in all these targets will be purified at JMU. Commercial gas that is 98% HD is distilled at low temperature to separate the remaining H2 and D2 and produce gas for making targets with very long spin relaxation times. Recent upgrades to the distillery permit the production of gas with H2 and D2 impurities much lower than previously obtained leading to higher quality targets for the next round of experiments. Existing gas stores are sufficient to produce the required gas.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this research and will gain experience in nuclear experiments and detectors, data analysis, and applications of nuclear physics."

This project will lay the groundwork for finite-temperature studies of nuclear physics by pursuing the systematic study of strongly-coupled Fermi systems and by testing this approach with related few- and many-body problems in atomic physics. The numerical methods developed here focus on nonperturbative aspects of the nuclear many-body problem and the results are expected to impact other fields such as atomic and condensed matter physics, high-energy physics and astrophysics. The group will establish a database of Monte Carlo configurations that will serve the scientific community in the USA and abroad.<br/><br/>This project will promote an interdisciplinary study employing advanced first-principles calculations in several fields, ranging from nuclear physics to condensed matter and atomic physics. This will present unique opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to develop a broad understanding of various physical systems and perform creative multidisciplinary research.

0.14,"Nuclear astrophysics is the study of how elements are created in various stellar environments and how such environments evolve. For example, stellar burning is responsible for the production of elements up to iron, and neutron capture processes create most of the heavy elements. However, the origin of heavy, proton-rich nuclei above iron is one of the greatest puzzles of stellar nucleosynthesis. The most likely scenario for creating these isotopes is the p-process: a complex network of photodisintegration reactions and their inverse (proton-, alpha- and neutron-capture) that occur during the explosion of a supernova. A vast network of 20,000 nuclear reactions for the p-process relies on models to provide input of nuclear properties and reaction rates for all the nuclei involved in the network. The goal of this project is to identify the reactions that are key for the p-process and to measure them directly, so as to minimize the uncertainty for those rates and provide constraints for the model predictions. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to understanding of the stellar p-process by measuring cross sections for proton and alpha capture reactions of relevance for Pd-102, Cd-108, Cd-110, Te-120 and Te-122. Those reactions have not been measured before, and have been identified as key for the p-process by two independent sensitivity studies. Studies have shown that the variations of those rates within the current model uncertainties have a significant impact on the production of the p-nuclei. The project will utilize a newly purchased detector (HECTOR) to employ the &#947;-summing technique. The impact of the measured reaction rates on the final abundances of the p-nuclei will be verified using network calculations whose results will be compared with the solar abundances. Additionally, the measured cross sections will be compared with model predictions and will be used to identify the model inputs that best reproduce the data."
0.471,"The Nuclear Science Laboratory (NSL) at the University of Notre Dame (ND) operates a world-renowned scientific program in nuclear astrophysics, nuclear structure and radioactive beam physics, as well as in nuclear physics applications, radiation chemistry, and material analysis. A very successful Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) program dedicated to nuclear astrophysics, aimed at complementing the existing laboratory measurement and detection techniques, and based on the FN accelerator was added in 2003. This MRI will allow the lab to modify the low energy injection system of the tandem to provide the high mass resolution necessary for improved isotopic selectivity. The modified system will extend measurement capabilities and expand the broad portfolio of available accelerated beams, making the NSL a unique and world-leading facility for both the development of new highly sensitive detection techniques and for the measurements of isotopic ratios not yet possible. <br/><br/>The MRI will provide the Notre Dame AMS facility with the capability of measuring radioactive probes and developing innovative AMS detection techniques that only two other facilities worldwide (Technische Universitt Mnchen - Munich) and Australian National University - Canberra) can also provide due to the combination of available energies, detection techniques and scope of scientific program. The radioactive probes allow us to better understand current supernovae models and stellar nucleosynthesis, and provide evidence of injection of freshly synthesized material into the proto solar system as well as by possible nearby supernova events in the more recent past. In order to exploit these long-lived probes new innovative detection techniques have been developed. <br/><br/>The new injection system will also greatly enhance our efforts in applied techniques that have recently received considerable interest both locally and nationally, resulting in new collaborations with the art world and the art history community to provide state-of-the-art identification of artifacts. This program introduces non-physics faculty to the benefit of new analytical methods in fields as diverse as anthropology, archaeology and art history and attracts their students into the NSL to take advantage of new research opportunities.

1.0,"The most compelling problem confronting detection of nuclear material in a large area is the level of manifest uncertainty. Furthermore, detection and localization problems involve nontrivial and nonlinear non-convex optimization often stuck at local minima. This project develops fundamentally new techniques by using cheap detectors for rough detection and localization, placing detectors to expunge local minima, achieving fast distributed localization with reduced communication overheads, simultaneously localizing multiple sources and optimally placing detectors and assisting in their autonomous self-organization.<br/><br/>There is a growing recognition of the inadequacy of current capabilities with respect to nuclear material detection and localization in public events and areas. This project develops an integrated cyber-physical system for public protection against nuclear and radiological threats. Clearly the project addresses a national security issue. If successful, the contribution and results of the project likely open a new framework for detection or monitoring in a large area using a wireless detector network. One of the key aspects of this project is the inter-disciplinary training of our graduate and undergraduate students including female and minority students in the areas of signal processing, statistical methods, modeling and performance analysis. K-12 students are also targeted through the First competition and Project-Lead-The-Way that connects the College of Engineering at the University of Iowa to almost all high school students in Iowa.

0.327468,"The research objective of this award is to test the hypothesis that the electromagnetic field associated with the nuclear radiation incident on semiconductor channels will interact with the spin of the electrons via the Rashba spin-orbit interaction mechanism. The approach will be to design 4-terminal non-local spin-valve devices comprised of wide band-gap semiconductor channels over which four electrodes will be deposited. Inner two electrodes will be made out of a ferromagnetic metal while the outer two electrodes will be made out of a nonmagnetic metal. Geometry of the magnetic electrodes will be kept different deliberately in order to make their coercivities dissimilar so that their relative orientation (parallel or antiparallel) could be changed independently. These spin-valve sensors will be exposed to controlled radiation environments and non-local measurements of magneto-resistance and Hanle-effect will be performed. Experimental research will be supported by Monte Carlo simulation and theoretical modeling to understand the mechanism of radiation-spin interaction in semiconductors. <br/><br/>If successful, this research will lead to room-temperature nuclear radiation detectors which will find applications in various civil, mechanical, manufacturing, medical imaging and security systems.

0.22,"Genetic imprinting and maternal genotype effects are two epigenetic phenomenon, which may lead to heritable changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These epigenetic factors, also known as parent-of-origin effects, have been increasingly explored for their roles in complex traits as part of a concerted effort to find the ""missing heritability"". Research on parent-of-origin effects has taken on a new dimension as the next generation sequencing technology becomes wildly available. However, despite the great biological and technological progress and innovation, statistical methods are lacking behind. Most existing methods for studying imprinting/maternal effects are restricted to data from nuclear families. The applicability of such methods is further hindered by the need to make strong but unrealistic assumptions to reduce the number of parameters to avoid overparametrization. In addition, imprinting and maternal effects are confounded and maternal effect is believed to be heterogeneous; all these further complicate modeling and analysis efforts. This project takes up this challenging problem and aims to develop novel statistical and computational models/methods and software for extended families and nuclear families without making the strong but unrealistic assumptions. For nuclear family data from retrospective studies, in addition to case families, the study design also considers controls, which can be in the form of control nuclear families or internal controls from unaffected siblings of case families. This novel design makes it possible to formulate a partial likelihood approach, wherein the likelihood component of interest is free of the nuisance parameters. This circumvents the problem of overparametrization and unrealistic assumptions that plague existing methods. For extended pedigrees from prospective studies, the focus is on the development of a method for incorporating heterogeneous maternal effects and addressing the issue of missing data, which is common for extended pedigrees. Methods proposed will be implemented in software that will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>The importance of epigenetics in the twenty first century cannot be overstated. To borrow science writer David Shenk's words, epigenetics is ``perhaps the most important discovery in the science of heredity since the gene''. In this regard, genomic imprinting and maternal effects, two aspects of the epigenetic process, holds important roles as they are essential for normal mammalian growth and development but can also cause devastating diseases and birth defects. Genetic imprinting refers to the epigenetic marking of the parental origin of a gene, which leads to the same DNA sequence being expressed differently depending on whether it is inherited from the mother or from the father. It is well known that Prader?Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are genetic disorders involving genetic imprinting. Maternal effect refers to the influence of the prenatal environment provided by a mother, which may arise from the expression levels of some genes carried by the child being altered by the additional genetic materials passed from the mother during pregnancy. Biological research increasingly reveals the presence and importance of maternal effect in many diseases such as childhood cancer and birth defects. This projects aims to develop novel statistical methods and computational software that circumvent difficulties in identifying genes that bear imprinting and/or maternal effects using nuclear and extended family data. The tools developed will be made available to the larger scientific community to aid scientific discoveries and finding treatments for genetic diseases. This project will also contribute to the training of the next generation of researchers in a cutting-edge interdisciplinary research area that fuses knowledge in biology, statistics and computer science."
0.326162,"PI: Lammerdng. Jan<br/>Proposal ID: 1254846<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: While cell migration on 2-dimensional (2-D) substrates has been studied for many decades, the physical challenges cells face when moving in 3-D environments are only beginning to emerge now. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that deformation of the large and stiff nucleus presents a rate-limiting step during migration through tight constriction encountered in 3-D environments such as extracellular matrixes or during intra- or extravasation. This project will address to what extent the deformability of the nucleus governs the transit of cells through narrow constrictions by monitoring cells as they migrate through microfluidic channels with defined constrictions while visualizing subcellular deformations and transit efficiency. In addition, ablation of cytoskeletal filaments with femtosecond laser pulses as cells pass through narrow constrictions will be used to determine whether the nucleus is being pulled or pushed by the cytoskeleton to overcome its resistance when squeezing through constrictions smaller than the size of the nucleus. Complementing these experiments, molecular sensors engineered from modified nuclear envelope proteins that report tensile forces and localized compression at the nuclear envelope by changes in fluorescence intensity or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency will be applied to cells during 3-D migration to quantify the cytoskeletal forces acting on the nucleus during 3-D migration and visualize their distribution along the nuclear periphery.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>The research activities will be complemented with a comprehensive education and outreach program that builds on simplified models of the proposed research to introduce middle and high school students to biomedical engineering, with the goal of increasing participation of female students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects. Tapioca pearls, the key ingredient of the popular bubble tea, will be used as safe, easily accessible, and inexpensive stand-in for biological cells, while simple 'millifluidic' devices replace technically demanding microfluidics designs to probe cellular biomechanics. These 'tapioca millifluidics' experiments, along with accompanying lectures, will be introduced to students from underserved middle and high schools as part of existing and novel outreach programs at Cornell University that target high school girls and underrepresented minorities to provide them with hands-on experiences in biomedical engineering to boost confidence, meet role models, and overcome gender stereotypes. An additional education component is the creation of an online portal for self-directed learning to address the challenge of teaching interdisciplinary biomedical engineering courses to students with diverse academic backgrounds."

0.075,"The weak interaction, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, is responsible for the type of radioactive decay called beta decay. Precise measurements of beta decay can probe the limits of our understanding of the weak interaction, complementing particle collider experiments in the search for new physics while being much less costly. The recent development of facilities, such as at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, that can produce a variety of beams of radioactive isotopes has created new opportunities for improved beta decay measurements. To fully exploit the potential of these new isotopes requires a good understanding of the response of various types of particle detectors. Understanding the response of particle detectors is also important for many applications in homeland security, nuclear safeguards, and medicine. The instrument to be acquired through this grant will enable the measurement of the response of a variety of particle detectors to a new level of precision over a wide energy range. <br/><br/>Precise measurements of the shapes of spectra in nuclear beta decay are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model of particle interactions. The recent development of powerful radioactive beam facilities has created a new opportunity for improved measurements of nuclear beta spectrum shapes through implantation of the nuclei in detectors that fully contain the emitted particles. In the ideal case, this provides measurements free of many of the systematic e&#64256;ects more conventional beta spectroscopy is subject to. Fully exploiting the potential of the new detector method, however, requires precise knowledge of implantation detector response. This detector response characterization is the primary research to be enabled by the proposed acquisition of an all-digital multi-parameter gamma spectroscopy system. The basis of the characterizations is the Wide Angle Compton Coincidence technique. This technique uses Compton scattering with standard gamma sources of modest strength to characterize the energy dependent electron response of essentially any detector material relative to, for example, a High Purity Germanium detector. The system acquired under this proposal will enable the measurement of the nonlinearity of a wide variety of detectors to a new level of precision and over a wider energy range than presently exists."
0.24,"Non-technical Summary<br/><br/>Intermetallic compounds are key technological materials. As an example, NiAl, or nickel aluminide, is used as a structural material in jet turbines of Boeing aircraft. It must retain strength under enormous centrifugal forces and white-hot temperatures. Physical and material properties ultimately depend on structure and dynamics at the atomic level. Like the familiar rock-salt crystal structure, intermetallics such as NiAl and the ones to be studied in this project have highly ordered structures, but inevitably contain point defects. These include atoms on wrong sites and missing atoms, called ""vacancies"". Vacancies make it possible for atoms in solids to move through jumps of atoms into neighboring vacancies, a process known as diffusion. However, such motion may lead to agglomeration of defects, weakening the material and increasing the potential for fracture. For this reason, it is important to study the behavior of defects in crystals. This project will use a nuclear spectroscopy that can monitor the locations of probe atoms on an atomic scale. The spectroscopy, PAC, measures interactions of nuclei of impurity probe atoms with fields produced by the local surroundings of the probes. Different local surroundings lead to distinct fields that serve to label and identify the locations of the probes. In addition, the rate at which the probe atoms jump at high temperature can be measured. This project has two main goals. (1) To obtain a better understanding of the systematics of diffusion through studies on series of related compounds. (2) To measure interaction energies of pairs of impurity atoms in compounds, which may attract or repel each other. Achieving these goals will contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of intermetallic compounds at high temperatures, measured on a true atomic scale. The PI will integrate the research with education by training graduate, under-graduate as well as high-schools students. Efforts will be made to involve female students and members of under-represented minorities. Promising students from within the university and local high schools will be sought out and a tutorial group research website will be maintained.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Intermetallic compounds are key technological materials. Physical and material properties ultimately depend on structure and dynamics at the atomic level. In this project, Professor Gary S. Collins and students are applying a specialized nuclear hyperfine spectroscopy, perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC), to study diffusion phenomena and solute interactions in intermetallics. Students receive interdisciplinary training in solid-state physics, nuclear laboratory methods, and data analysis. <br/>The principal measurable is the nuclear quadrupole interaction at PAC probe nuclei caused by local electric field gradients (EFGs). The project builds on twin methodologies pioneered in Collins's laboratory over the previous ten years. The first is measurement of diffusional jump-frequencies of probe atoms made through analysis of nuclear relaxation in PAC spectra caused by fluctuating EFGs. The second is determination of differences in energies of probe-atom solutes at different crystallographic sites. Both kinds of measurements are made in thermodynamic equilibrium at high temperature. PAC results will be buttressed by classical diffusivity measurements out of which correlation factors for impurity diffusion will be determined for the first time in a direct way. Three major efforts will be undertaken, as follows: <br/><br/>1) Jump-frequencies of cadmium tracer atoms will be measured in select systems to round out extensive studies already made for five series of rare-earth phases having the Cu3Au structure. <br/>2) The correlation factor is an important parameter in the theory of impurity diffusion but has never been measured in a direct way. Diffusivity measurements will be carried out on several alloys for which precise PAC jump-frequency data already exist. Dividing the diffusivity by the jump-frequency yields the correlation factor; its temperature dependence will also be determined. <br/>3) Interaction energies between pairs of solute atoms will be measured for the first time, with one atom of the pair being a PAC probe atom. Crystal EFGs and EFGs caused by solute atoms near the PAC probes will be used to identify locations of probe and solute atoms. Association enthalpies will be determined from temperature dependences of solute site fractions for a variety of solutes and phases, including phases having common, cubic, crystal structures. <br/><br/>This work is fundamental and interdisciplinary in scope, bridging solid-state physics and materials science. PAC has an excellent ability to determine detailed atomic arrangements and atom movements at high temperature. Jump-frequency measurements on additional series of rare-earth alloys will help to firm up rules showing how diffusion behavior (and site-preferences) of probe atoms depend on phase, composition and temperature. Detailed diffusion mechanisms may be elucidated for complex crystal structures. Measured correlation factors may also depend upon, and give insight into, diffusion mechanisms. Studies of solute-solute interactions will be used to formulate heuristic rules for predicting site preferences and estimating association energies between solute-atom pairs."
0.05,"This proposal will establish an I-Corp team for seeking an experiential learning opportunity to help in determining the commercial readiness of the developed technology for the state-of-the-art germanium detectors, which will improve the detection of radiation from objects including human diseases (cancer), personal travel items and cargos at the gate of airports and harbors for the applications of diagnosis in nuclear medicine, materials screening, monitoring of decommissioning of nuclear power plants, and homeland security. An imaging camera has two detection planes, which will be made of high purity germanium crystals with excellent energy resolution. The imaging camera has a bright future as a screening detector or medical imaging device considering its portability, compactness, low patient dose, multiple-radioisotope tracing capability, inherent three dimensional (3D) imaging capability at a fixed position. Currently, however, the image resolution of the Compton camera is not sufficient for medical imaging. In this project, the I-Corps team intends to improve imaging system using germanium detectors with high sensitive energy resolution and position resolution. The developed technology can be especially helpful for detecting abnormal growth in body tissue or the growth of lymph nodes, which use gamma-ray sources as diagnostic radiation tools. Similar, tumor growth or cancer, such as breast cancer, in the human body can be detected by this technology because gamma-ray sources are often used for cancer treatment as well as diagnostic purposes. Recently, cancer has become one of the most devastating diseases worldwide. One of the techniques used for treating cancers is nuclear medicine with radiation tracers, which can emit gamma rays. Philips, GE and Siemens are some of the leading companies in the domain with scanning technology for cancer treatment. The proposed detector technology is based on a dynamic read-out that provides both excellent energy resolution and position resolution as a camera can be commercialized through either through licensing, establishing a joint venture or establishing a standalone company.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop and commercialize an imaging camera using germanium detectors that will improve the detection of radiation from objects including human diseases (cancer), personal travel items, and cargos at the gate of airports and harbors. The scope is to develop the technology in two phases within three years. The Phase I project is to develop a large germanium detector with 23  23 dynamic read-out system for proof-of-concept in a year. A dynamic read-out system will be accomplished by measuring the charge induced on electrodes with multiple channels that are positioned close but not electronically connected to the detector materials. The multiple electrodes will be fabricated on a circuit board that is positioned 0.5 mm from the detector surface onto which charge is collected. A dynamic read-out system with multiple channels will adopt the proximity read-out technique developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory by utilizing its advantages of simplified detector fabrication, expanded electrode geometry options, and greatly improved position resolution through simple signal interpolation. In Phase II, the team will fabricate a germanium orthogonal dynamic read-out detector (GODD) for testing new detector technology innovations as an imaging system in two years. The GODD will then be tested on passengers' travel items and cargos, mimicking airport and harbor nuclear and non- nuclear imaging tests. The simulated airport and harbor tests will be performed at The University of South Dakota (USD) under a subcontract and compare the relative merits of the GODD in airport or harbor situations with modern imaging systems. GODD response to realistic test objectives will be established. With a dynamic read-out system that greatly improves position resolution of a germanium detector, which can detect small, low contrast objects, including position of the source of radiation and even tumors in human body. New fabrication methods for contacts, improved electronics and experience with long term stability of germanium detectors, make them important for national security tasks."

0.275764,"Bolotnov, Igor <br/>1333993<br/><br/>Reliable prediction of multiphase turbulent flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is important in a wide range of engineering applications (e.g., flows in nuclear reactors, chemical processing plants, heat exchangers etc). While some multiphase flows can be successfully modeled, many questions remain unanswered regarding the interactions between bubbles and the turbulence. Specifically, multiphase CFD approaches utilize interfacial forces (e.g., lift, drag forces) to predict the bubble distribution in the flow. However, the influence of the turbulence on the interfacial forces is not fully understood. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>The project objective is to quantify bubble/turbulence interactions in a specific set of flow conditions by analyzing experimentally validated interface tracking simulations and to create new turbulence spectrum that accounts for interfacial forces to be used in multiphase CFD and multiphase large-eddy simulations (LES). Advanced finite-element based flow solver (PHASTA) with Level-Set method for interface tracking will be used to perform the bubble/turbulence interaction studies. This code has been successfully applied to large scale direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent flows in various geometries, as well as interface tracking simulations (including bubbly channel flow, annular flow). The proposed research will test the following hypotheses: (i) Bubbles deposit energy to the liquid turbulence eddies of the same size and deformability of a bubble controls the amount of energy, and may result in reverse energy transfer from the liquid turbulence; (ii) The energy deposition into the liquid turbulence is affected by the presence of the wall and the bubble/wall interactions modify the law of the wall and affect shear-induced energy production; (iii) The lateral bubble distribution in turbulent shear flow is governed by interfacial forces which strongly depend on bubble/turbulence interaction. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>The success of this project will be instrumental in developing new multiphase flow models that have the ability to design advanced engineering systems with multiphase CFD. More accurate models for this type of flows can allow the construction of more efficient nuclear power plants, chemical processing plants as well as bring two-phase flow applications in other areas of engineering. High-fidelity interface tracking simulations will be introduced in graduate level courses on thermal hydraulics in the Nuclear Engineering Department. In addition, basic concepts related to the proposed research will be presented to high school students through the yearly Young Investigator's Summer Program in Nuclear Technology organized by the Nuclear Engineering Department's Outreach Program."

The spins are associated with electrons; spin is an intrinsic quantum mechanical property that can be exploited to make a two-state quantum mechanical system, or qubit, in the engineered mound of a semiconductor surface or quantum dot. This award supports a theoretical research and undergraduate education program aimed at elucidating several of the key aspects of spin-based quantum information processors, focusing on the physical mechanisms that govern the coherence properties of spins in quantum dots and enable their control and manipulation.<br/><br/>The two main ingredients of a successful design of qubits - the building blocks of a quantum computer - are preserving the coherence of their fragile states and finding mechanisms that will allow high fidelity qubit control and manipulation at the single- and two-qubit level. Addressing the first, the PI and his research students will model and analyze the fluctuating charge and nuclear environments, which form the main decoherence channels for electron spin qubits. A better understanding of the adverse effects of the environment on spin qubits at current experimental setups will allow the team to test and propose strategies to extend coherence, including time-dependent control fields, novel qubit designs, and encoding of the logical states in physical states of three electron spins. The research supported by this award will further explore coupling strategies for multi-qubit devices and develop optical and electrical methods to control the nuclear spins in the quantum dot substrate, by utilizing their hyperfine interaction with the localized electron spins. <br/><br/>The program supported through this award will be carried out at Santa Clara University, a Primarily Undergraduate Institution, and will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate students through independent research projects throughout its duration.

3.916844,"The development and refinement of advanced materials for nuclear and cutting edge applications will allow energy systems to operate with increased reliability, safety, and economy while increasing sustainability and limiting negative environmental impacts. This research will significantly reduce the principal bottleneck for developing future energy technologies, i.e., the lack of reliable damage-resistant materials for use under extreme environments. The research will critically advance knowledge about the interaction of particle and plasma beams with various materials under extreme irradiation conditions. These scientific outcomes have related policy impacts for systems modeling and energy planning in both the near and long term for both developed and developing countries as global appetites for energy continue to increase. Improving sustainability outcomes while securing our energy future entails a global outlook that brings together the appropriate people and resources to not only advance basic research but also to ensure the existence of a diverse, globally-minded and well-trained cadre of scientists, policy specialists, and industry workers. The goal for this project is to provide robust computer resources and experimental validation to minimize irradiation-based design constraints of materials performance while situating this research within a larger context of sustainability, resource management, and global energy policy. This project draws on international research partnerships to develop the human capital essential for further work in materials under extreme conditions. It brings together key partners and research facilities in Japan, Russia, Germany, and Ireland that will enable graduate student research across disciplines with a focus on Nuclear Energy/Fusion, Lithography, and High Energy and Nuclear Physics Applications. No one location can provide all these facilities; together with resources at Purdue, Illinois, and Tuskegee, students gain critical experience in modeling, simulation, and experimentation. Scientific gains from the experimental research also have potentially far-reaching implications for industrial sectors such as semi-conductor manufacturing using EUVL as well as in energy sectors including solar, wind, and coal.

0.17465,"The midcontent region of the North American craton has experienced a number of large ( > M6) earthquakes beyond the terminus of the Laruentide Ice Sheet during the Holocene and Anthropocene. The mechanisms responsible for these earthquakes are poorly understood. The main goal of this study is to assess the consequences of lithosphere flexure associated with Pleistocene ice-sheet loading on the build up and preservation of pore pressure anomalies and seismicity within the Proterozoic crystalline basement and overlying sedimentary rocks of the Michigan and Illinois Basins. We hypothesize that shear stress build up within the upper crust (10-20 km depth) beyond the ice sheet terminus causes pore pressure increases within low-permeable environments capable of inducing seismic events. Underpressures, such as those observed at the proposed Canadian nuclear waste repository site on the eastern flank of the Michigan Basin, should occur in formerly glaciated areas undergoing rebound today. Using COMSOL, we will develop a two-dimensional geomechanical-hydrologic-solute transport model capable of representing lithosphere flexure and poro-elastic deformation as well as asthenosphere and groundwater flow. We will utilize a simple Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria as a metric for determining regions of the Earth?s crust that are likely to fail. Ground truth for this model will include the position and (where possible) depths of midcontinent Holocene and Anthropocene earthquakes as well as pore pressure/salinity/isotopic data from reservoirs and confining units of the Illinois and Michigan Basins. <br/><br/>Isolating high-level nuclear waste requires consideration of future hydrologic and geomorphic conditions on time scale of up to one million years. The results of this project should be especially relevant to nuclear waste isolation programs in countries located at high latitude countries ( > 40o N) such as those in Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and Finland. All of these countries could experience future glacations. Project results will be made available to the Canadian Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) and the Swedish Nuclear Waste Management Agency (SKB). This work may also be of benefit to groups studying induced seismicity within the midcontinent by indentifying regions of the Earth?s crust that could preserve high fluid pressures and would be prone to failure. This project will train one graduate student at NM Tech, a minority-serving institution. Effort will be made to recruit a woman and/or an individual from an under-represented group."
1.2,"The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) is the nation's premier facility to accelerate nuclei with the purpose of studying nuclear structure. NSCL has developed world-unique new experimental capabilities with reaccelerated rare-isotope beams, ensuring a continued leadership role in rare-isotope physics worldwide. With the recent expansion of research capabilities at NSCL, demand for these beams to be used in nuclear physics experiments has never been higher. The instrument proposed here, called a Helium-Jet Ion Gas System (HJ-IGS) will allow for commensal running of two experiments simultaneously, each using different detector systems at NSCL, which will expand the number of experiments and hence help to meet the demand for experiments that increase our understanding of nuclei.<br/><br/>Helium-Jet Ion Sources have been used for harvesting isotopes in the past, but the idea to use such a system to harvest some of the rarest isotopes available to researchers in a projectile fragmentation facility is novel. Rare isotopes that are bent out of the central beam path during the purification process of the primary rare-isotope beam are stopped and collected in a high-pressure cell filled with Helium saturated with aerosols to which the stopped isotopes will attach. With a high-pressure differential, the collected isotopes are quickly transported through a 40 meter-long capillary to an ion source that injects the isotopes, after purification, into a beam line that can feed one of several stations not used in the primary experiment. This allows two experiments to be performed at the same time: an experiment using a fast rare isotope beam directly produced in projectile fragmentation and an experiment with stopped or reaccelerated beams using the harvested, transported, ionized and purified isotopes in the HJ-IGS. State-of-the-art experiments that are in high demand in the fields of nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics, as well as fundamental interactions and symmetries, and include such diverse techniques as high-precision mass measurements in atom traps, in-beam laser spectroscopy and polarization, nuclear decay spectroscopy, and low-energy reaction studies with an active-target time projection chamber."
0.471999,"The last decade has produced a remarkable revolution in neutrino physics. We now know that at least some of the three flavors of neutrino have finite mass, and that flavor transformations occur through the process known as neutrino oscillations. Neutrino flavor oscillations are governed by a matrix with three mixing angles and a Charge-Parity (CP) violating phase. It is currently thought that the possibility of CP symmetry violation in the neutrino sector is the best possibility for explaining the apparent matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. <br/><br/>Two of the three mixing angles have been well determined by previous experiments. This award provides base support for work on determining the final mixing angle (known as theta-13) through the precision study of the oscillation of antineutrinos emitted from the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in China. This experiment has been under construction for several years, and has just begun to acquire data using two of the full complement of eight antineutrino detectors. The Daya Bay experiment has recently published their initial results for theta-13. During the period covered by this award, it is expected that an improved measurement will be obtained.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>The group plans to take advantage of their connection with the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) to partner with their renowned Office of Science Education to enable them to impact science education in middle schools and high schools. They will work with the JLab Science Activities for Teachers (JSAT) program to update and expand their materials for middle school teachers in the area of nuclear energy. Since the incident at Fukushima in Japan, the public interest in nuclear power and its safety has been heightened.

The proposed research activities is desigend to provide up to 4 to 5 orders of magnitudes of NMR signal enhancement. If successful, this new apparatus will enable characterization of interfaces and surfaces in a way not feasible before. Consequently, the largest impact of the proposed research lies in the characterization of chemical systems and materials of interest to society; namley, catalysts and energy-related and/or biocompatible materials. The proposed research also offers interdisciplinary training opportunities to next generation graduate and undergraduate students by providing them with hands-on experience in technology and hardware development from the ground up.<br/><br/>The overarching research goal is to advance ssDNP-enhanced NMR as a chemical characterization tool, with the focus on resolving local signatures of nanometer-scale domains and solid surfaces, where chemical processes occur and that are critical for material function. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is to address fundamental roadblocks in and mechanisms of ssDNP performance via studies of the temperature and microwave power dependence of DNP enhancements, frequency profiles and build-up time curves, as well as electron and nuclear spin relaxation times. Contemporary chemical systems from nanostructured hydrogels, mesoporous catalysts to supported catalysts will be studied, with the aim of selectively characterizing surface signatures and spatially heterogeneous solute/solvent composition. The prospect for DNP to transform NMR from offering atomistic details, but averaged over the entire sample into a surface sensitive and selective tool, is promising."
0.08079,"The understanding of the strong interactions, the force that determines the structure of atomic nuclei, is one of the most challenging problems in the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the number and properties of all the elementary particles. The fundamental theory of the strong interactions, based on the theory of quarks and gluons known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), has a very complex dynamics which gives rise to the rich properties of hadrons (baryons, including protons and neutrons, and mesons and their excitations) and also to the complexity observed in nuclear interactions and structure. The challenges are therefore many and very complex. Those challenges require a variety of experimental efforts, as well as theoretical efforts. In this context, this project will further develop the connection between the fundamental theory of QCD and hadronic/nuclear physics. It is expected that tools and methods developed in that context may have a broader domain of applications. The PI is a joint appointee in the Theory Group at Jefferson Lab, providing him with the opportunity to focus on Jefferson Lab related physics. An important mission of the project is the education and training at Hampton University of graduate and undergraduate students. An additional broader impact of the project will be the PI's interaction with scientists involved in Jefferson Lab experiments.<br/><br/>This project focuses on low and intermediate energy strong interactions in single hadron and few nucleon problems, as well as some fundamental aspects of QCD. The methods used are based in rigorous descriptions of the strong interactions known as effective theories, which are consistent with QCD, and make use of experimental as well as lattice QCD calculations results. The aim is to advance the theoretical knowledge of QCD and the develop theoretical methods. More specifically, in single hadrons, two main lines of research will be pursued: 1) Development and applications of an improved chiral effective theory in baryons, where the combination of the low energy and the 1/Nc expansions (Nc is the number of color degrees of freedom in QCD) is implemented; applications to baryon observables, and in particular to results obtained in Lattice QCD for those observables will be pursued, where in particular the quark mass dependencies accessible through Lattice QCD will be utilized for analyzing issues of convergence of the effective theory. Particular emphasis will be on the applications to baryons involving strangeness, where there are still unresolved issues with the implementation of effective theories due to the relatively large mass of the strange quark. In particular, these studies have impact in for improving the accuracy of the extraction of weak interaction parameters from hyperon decays. 2) Study of excited baryons in the framework of the 1/Nc expansion, which has as main aim the use of that fundamental expansion of QCD to organize the description of baryon resonances; this work has an impact in the analysis of current experimental results on baryon resonances from various facilities, in particular Jefferson Lab, and it can also be applied to the current Lattice QCD calculations of the excited baryon spectrum. In few body physics, the research is focused on applying the combined chiral effective theory and 1/Nc expansion to study the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Among the fundamental aspects of QCD, the project will focus on pure glue-dynamics, studying its fundamental non-perturbative quantities, namely gluon condensate and topological susceptibility using methods of holographic QCD."
0.033591,"The aim of this project is to advance the understanding of the inner workings of the atom. Specifically, this project investigates how all the components that make up the beryllium atom, the fourth element on the periodic table, come together to give beryllium its atomic and nuclear properties. Our knowledge of atomic systems is driven by both experimental and theoretical results. The lighter elements (hydrogen, helium, and lithium) have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Because beryllium has more subatomic particles compared to the three lighter elements, it is more complex and difficult to model. As the computations involved in modeling this atom grow more complex, it becomes essential to provide experimental results to both check those calculations and determine which theoretical models correctly describe this multi-electron system. The most precise experimental measurements currently available for beryllium are up to 10,000 times less precise than those for the three lighter elements. This project will greatly improve upon these experimental measurements in order to validate fundamental atomic and nuclear theories as well as provide information about the nuclear and electronic structure of the atom. Understanding beryllium is an important stepping stone to developing a multi-electron theory that successfully describes larger and heavier atoms, which make up the bulk of the periodic table of the elements and are essential components of the materials that we live and work with every day.<br/><br/>High precision spectroscopy will be performed on the neutral beryllium isotope chain to significantly improve the experimental accuracy of several key energy levels. The results will delineate various theoretical models, test quantum electrodynamics, and help determine the nuclear charge radius of beryllium. Spectroscopy will be performed on both singlet states (2s2p, 2s3d, and 2snp Rydberg states) and triplet states (2s2p, 2s3s, 2s4s, and 2snp Rydberg states) as well as the ionization threshold. An oven operating at 1200 degrees Celsius will produce a beam of neutral atomic beryllium. Transverse spectroscopy will be performed on this atomic beam using a variety of laser sources including a frequency quadrupled Ti-Sapphire laser and external cavity diode lasers. Photon energy calibration is provided by a calibrated ultra low expansion cavity and the atom-light interaction is detected by absorption, fluorescence, or ion detection depending on the state being studied."
0.728,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. This research program centers around two experiments to make precise measurements of physical properties of the neutron. The first experiment, called UCNA, is being carried out at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, using extremely slow neutrons (ultra-cold neutrons, or UCN), which have such low energy that they can be stored in magnetic ""bottles"". This allows the experiment to make a precise measurement of the direction of the electron emitted when a neutron decays into a proton, an electron and a particle called an anti-neutrino. This provides needed information about the theory of radioactivity (also called the weak nuclear force). In addition, the PI and his group are developing equipment for a future experiment to search for a possible electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. The existence of this EDM would be a signal of new physics beyond our current knowledge and could help to explain why the universe is dominated by matter, whereas the Standard Model of particle physics predicts there should be nearly equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Participation by postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduates is an essential part of the research program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in this frontier area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>This project is primarily focused on experimental research addressing fundamental properties of the free neutron. In particular the group will continue analyzing data from the UCNA experiment while also constructing hardware for a new, highly sensitive experiment to search for the neutron's EDM. The UCNA experiment will provide a high precision measurement of the beta-asymmetry in neutron decay using Ultra-Cold Neutrons for the first time. This quantity allows a sensitive test of the unitarity of the weak quark-mixing matrix and has the potential to provide evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle interactions. With recent improvements to the apparatus the group is poised to improve the precision on the asymmetry down to ~ 0.3% with additional data-taking and analysis during the period of this grant. The goal of the new EDM experiment, called nEDM, is being done at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and will improve the upper limit by a factor of 100 compared to previous measurements; observation of an EDM signals violation of time-reversal and charge-parity (CP) symmetry, and could provide important information related to the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe."

This goal is only now beginning to be realized in practice using Lattice QCD and effective field theory methods. The focus of the proposed project is on obtaining physical predictions for basic nuclear interactions and properties with controlled uncertainties - arising primarily from extrapolation to the physical quark masses and to the continuum limit - accounted for systematically. Among the nuclear physics questions that this research project is focused on answering are: Which two- and three-baryon systems are bound and what are their binding energies? Are there three-body bound systems involving hyperons? What are the low-energy hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon phase shifts, and how will knowledge of these quantities help unravel the role of hyperons and hypernuclei in dense matter such as might occur in the core of neutron stars? <br/><br/>This research will help provide a link between long-observed properties of atomic nuclei and the theoretical framework that is believed to provide a basis for these observations, by taking advantages of advances in computing technology and developments in theoretical physics that have only recently made this effort possible. Graduate student training forms an integral part of this project, and will provide education in theoretical physics as well as forefront computing methods."
0.056087,"It is a well-known fact that light, stable nuclei, those with which we are most familiar, are made up of roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons. This project will explore the structure of neutron-rich nuclei that are far from stability and consequently much less familiar. This will provide a vital understanding of the subtleties of the nuclear force in nuclei that can be found in explosive astrophysical environments, such as a supernova. These experiments will help us to understand the different abundances of the observed elements in the universe, in addition to engaging students in the study of these fundamental questions. In addition, the applied nuclear physics efforts at Hope College will use traditional accelerator techniques for the rapid testing of consumer goods and environmental samples containing chemicals of concern. Work on non-destructive characterization of automotive paint samples for forensic applications will continue. <br/><br/>Experiments producing unstable nuclei at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab (NSCL) (excited states of helium-9 and oxygen-26) will measure decay neutrons with the Modular Neutron Array, while emitted charged fragments are deflected with a high-field dipole magnet into timing and energy detectors. The properties of the decaying nucleus will be determined with invariant mass spectroscopy. Astrophysics measurements will also be done at the NSCL with the Summing NaI Detector supplemented with an internal beta detector or an internal gas cell constructed at Hope College. The interdisciplinary applied physics portion of the proposed research, done with the Hope accelerator, is principally based on particle induced gamma-ray emission, particle induced x-ray emission, and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy."
0.308991,"Numerical studies of non-abelian gauge theories coupled to fermions in different representations of the gauge group will form the central focus of all projects in this proposal. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) belongs to the class of theories we will investigate. The aim is to understand confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, the two features that help understand mass generation and much of the low energy non-perturbative aspects of these theories. We will consider the SU(N) gauge group and consider the limit of a large number of colors (N). We will couple the gauge theory to quarks in the adjoint representation. Using a phenomenon called reduction, we will be able to numerically study the theory on a single site lattice with the number of quark flavors extended to take on any real value. This will enable us to study conformal and near-conformal theories and help us understand mass generation. The de-confinement transition in QCD is currently under intense experimental investigation and we will study the role of baryonic chemical potential in the large-N limit of QCD. Two-dimensional fermion will be used as a probe to study the strong to weak coupling transition in the large N limit of QCD-like theories. We will study the effect of quark masses in multi-favor QCD and, in particular, consider the case of negative quark masses with the aim of identifying a curve in the space of mass parameters where one has massless pions. <br/><br/><br/>Quarks carry a color charge and nuclear matter is formed from the binding of colored quarks mediated by gluons. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory that describes the interaction of these color charges. Experiments have shown that quarks come in three colors but all nuclear matter is color neutral. Massless quarks and gluons give rise to nuclear matter that has mass. An understanding of this mass generation is of fundamental importance and this project will address various approaches to this problem by focusing on QCD-like theories in the limit of large number of colors. Such theories are closely related to recent developments in string theory and we will be able to make connections between field theory and string theory. The scientific methods involve analytical calculations and numerical computations. A post-doctoral fellow with prior experience in this area during his/her recent graduate work will be mentored by the PI to work on several aspects of the proposal. Computer clusters will be used for numerical computations and the results obtained as part of this proposal will be presented at international conferences in nuclear and particle physics."
0.27235,"Unlike the planets orbiting the sun, the electrons that whorl around the nucleus inside atoms are not allowed to do so at arbitrary distances. Quantum theory prescribes that only very specific average distances from the nucleus are allowed. This limitation gives rise to the specific colors of light that atoms respond to when hit with a laser beam. By tuning the laser precisely, one can find the specific colors that are in resonance with the orbiting electron, and thereby learn about the intricate details of the internal structure of the atom. While most atoms have many electrons, making the task of understanding the complicated pattern of orbits relatively difficult, hydrogen and helium have only one and two electrons, respectively, and hence are amenable to very precise theoretical prediction. By comparing these very precise predictions to similarly precise measurements, one can test whether or not the theory of ""quantum electrodynamics"" (the fundamental theory of light, atoms, and most of the rest of the ordinary world around us) is really correct, or only approximately so. The group supported by this grant plans to develop and deploy the laser sources and techniques that will allow improved tests of the quantum theory described above. If the theory is found to be correct at the new level of accuracy, the results of the experiments can then be used to determine the size of the nucleus in hydrogen and helium. A comparison of these sizes with what is known or predicted in nuclear physics will then provide a test of the scientific understanding of these simple nuclei. In this way, these experiments bridge the gap between the atom and the nucleus, and test the consistency of two regimes of physics which differ in length scale by a factor of 10,000. Laser sources and optical techniques are ubiquitous in science, technology and the economy, so training of students in this area provides valuable expertise, and has the potential to develop generally important laser sources and optical techniques for a wide range of applications. <br/><br/><br/>This research develops laser technology and precision laser techniques. It applies them to the study of helium fine structure and the precise determination of hydrogen and helium nuclear sizes. Optical methods are developed which involve high-speed electro-optic modulation of a stabilized semiconductor laser, creating microwave tunable frequency side bands on the laser. These side bands can then be used to drive and determine the transitions frequencies of the triplet 2S -> 2P in helium 3 and 4, and 1S->2S in hydrogen and its isotopes. The physics of the laser interaction with hydrogen and helium atoms is carefully studied to obtain the unperturbed frequencies of studied atomic transitions. Results will be obtained with sufficient precision to provide important comparisons with theory. These include (1) the atomic theory and computation of electron-electron interactions in helium, the simplest multi-electron atom, and (2) the nuclear interactions and computations that predict the observed size of few-nucleon nuclei. In particular, isotopic shifts in these experimental results allow the charge radii of helium-3 and tritium to be determined and compared to predictions of few-nucleon theory and the underlying description of the nuclear force."
2.234925,"Technical Description of Project:<br/><br/>Our project - Fundamental Studies in Nuclear Physics - at California Institute of Technology is primarily focused on experimental research addressing fundamental properties of the free neutron. In particular we will continue taking data with the UCNA experiment while also developing hardware for construction of a new, highly sensitive experiment to search for the neutron's electric dipole moment. <br/><br/>The UCNA experiment has already produced a precision measurement of the beta-asymmetry in neutron decay using Ultra-Cold Neutrons for the first time. This quantity allows a sensitive test of the unitarity of the CKM quark-mixing matrix and has the potential to provide evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle interactions. With recent improvements to the apparatus we are poised to improve the precision on the asymmetry down to ~ 0.3% with additional data-taking and analysis during the period of this grant. <br/><br/>The goal of the new electric dipole moment experiment - nEDM at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory - is to improve the sensitivity by a factor of 100 compared to previous measurements; observation of an electric dipole moment signals violation of time-reversal and charge-parity (CP) symmetry, and could provide important information related to the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe and the new physical phenomena that is responsible. <br/><br/>Non-technical Description of Project<br/><br/>Our project at Caltech is primarily focused on studying fundamental properties of the free neutron. The neutron is an unstable particle and decays with a ten minute half-life into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino. We are making precision measurements of the neutron decay using very slow neutrons that can be stored in bottles. These measurements should allow us to make the most precise measurements of the distribution of electrons from the decay of spin-polarized neutrons. These data can push our understanding of the neutron's decay to the limits of theoretical understanding and may indicate that our current picture is incomplete and must be revised. <br/><br/>We are also developing a new experiment to search for an electric dipole for the free neutron. An electric dipole is a separation of the plus and minus charge within this neutral particle. The existence of this dipole would signal a significant breakdown of so-called Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry. A significant breakdown of this symmetry has been suggested to explain why the universe is dominated by material composed of standard particles with virtually no anti-particles present in the universe. This puzzle (more matter than anti-matter) has stumped physicists for many years and we hope to discover and measure the neutron's electric dipole to help explain this basic property of the universe. <br/><br/>We also note that participation by postdoctoral scholars as well as graduate and undergraduate students is an essential part of the research program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in this frontier area of nuclear physics."
0.54,"This project is devoted to research by the University of Michigan Fundamental Neutron Physics Group on two fundamental-neutron-physics measurements: 1) measurement of the neutron lifetime with precision of approximately one second using a cold-neutron beam at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) and 2) measurement of the beta-neutrino correlation with the Nab/abBA/PANDA spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). These are two of the five highest priority experiments identified in recommendations by a recent NSAC review of the field. The physics has broad impact across the fields of nuclear and particle physics and astrophysics. Both efforts enjoy strong collaborations and the support of the community as well as the scrutiny of critical reviews. The University of Michigan group has key technical and leadership roles in both efforts. <br/><br/>At NIST, we will perform an absolute calibration of the neutron-flux monitor used in the proton-trap measurement of the neutron lifetime. The proton-trap apparatus was used the most recent beam-lifetime measurement with the result for the lifetime of (886.3 +/- 1.2 (stat) +/- 3.2(sys)) seconds, where the systematic error is dominated by uncertainties related to the neutron-flux monitor calibration. The flux-monitor calibration campaign includes two independent calibrations using a monochromatic neutron beam at NIST and thick targets of Boron-10 or liquid Helium-3. For the Boron-10 approach, alpha particles and gamma rays are counted, and a set of measurements has recently been completed that demonstrated internal consistency and precision that would reduce the systematic error to about 0.5 sec. For the Helium-3 approach, the heat generated by the charged particles in the 3He(n,p)3H reaction is measured calorimetrically and converted to a neutron flux. The calorimeter approach, originally developed by our group, has been shown to be capable of measuring the flux to 0.1 % with 10 hours of integration. A number of improvements specifically related to the challenges of the liquid Helium-3 target have been completed at the University of Michigan, and the device will be moved to NIST with the aim of completing the calibration campaign by 2013 and undertaking the new proton-trap lifetime measurement on the new NIST NGC beam line in 2014.<br/><br/>The Nab spectrometer and experiment is to measure the beta-neutrino correlation at SNS. The magnetic-field-expansion spectrometer is designed to measure proton-electron coincidences using proton time-of-flight spectroscopy to extract the a parameter. It may also be possible to extract the Fierz interference b from electron spectroscopy in silicon detectors. The envisioned continuing physics program with the Nab spectrometer and polarized neutrons (abBA/PANDA) is extremely rich with the ability to over constrain V-A parameters for neutron decay and thus probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The University of Michigan group is responsible for all aspects of neutron polarization and polarimetry beginning, for Nab, by measuring the neutron polarization of the unpolarized FP-13 beam with sensitivity to the polarization of less than 0.01%.<br/><br/>The neutron is a sub-atomic particle that comprises more than half of the matter in the world. Within the nuclei of most atoms, the neutron remains stable, but when freed from the nucleus, it is unstable. Free neutrons are an important tool for study of sub-atomic physics, because the decay and interactions of free neutrons reveal the interactions of its constituents and decay products. Neutrons also have spin, the quantum mechanical property of the most fundamental pieces of matter that distinguishes two states called spin-up and spin-down. Spin is responsible for the nuclear magnetism exploited, for example, in NMR and MRI. The spin states also affect the decay and interactions of neutrons, and so the control of neutron spin becomes useful for more detailed study of sub-atomic interactions. This project envisions a program to incisively and carefully advance both the precision and the accuracy of the neutron lifetime and the correlation of electron and neutrino momenta in neutron decay. <br/><br/>The neutron lifetime is a measured fundamental quantity that impacts physics from the formation of the elements to the solar energy cycle to the structure of the Standard-Model of the weak interaction. Discrepancies among recent measurements have actually led to reduced confidence in the value of the neutron lifetime, and a new measurement using different techniques is essential to resolving the discrepancies. The measurement of the neutron lifetime using a cold neutron beam will provide a different approach, and accurate measurement of the neutron flux is crucial to the experiment. The neutron flux will be measured with a detector that has sensitivity that scales in the same way as the detection of neutron decays, but which must be calibrated by an absolute method. Absolute calibration will be achieved by measuring the heat produced when the neutrons are absorbed by Helium-3 in a cryogenic target at two degrees above absolute zero. The goal of this calibration is to provide an accurate neutron-flux measurement and determine the neutron lifetime with one-second precision.<br/><br/>The angle between the electron and neutrino produced in neutron decay is sensitive to the fundamental strength of the weak interaction when combined with the neutron lifetime. A broader class of measurements using polarized neutron can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. A new spectrometer designed to measure both the proton and electron energies in neutron decay will first measure the electron-neutrino correlation and then be used with polarized neutrons.<br/><br/>This work probes deep intellectual questions about the most fundamental pieces of matter. The aim is to collect data that will help complete the picture of elementary particles and their interactions. The techniques have much broader impact. Laser polarized Helium-3 used to polarize neutrons has applications to materials science, and quantum information research. This project is a remarkable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and post doctoral fellows. The technical challenges combined with the deep intellectual issues provide motivation and develop technical skills. Undergraduates will gain research experience working along with graduate and post doctoral fellows. Graduate students emerge broadly capable and move on to prepare for faculty or national lab positions as well as interdisciplinary research. This work has also led to development of new courses for non-physics majors, to a set of public lectures on Nuclear Magnets and Neutrinos and leadership in communicating science to the interested general population. In the context of probing fundamental problems of physics, exciting in its own right, the hardest problems produce the most innovative solutions with spin-offs unimaginable at the outset. Atomic clocks, enhanced MRI, and experiments that probe the origin of matter all follow from the control of nuclear magnetism and neutron spins."
0.12,"Einstein's famous relation E=mc^2 expresses the equivalence of mass and energy and is one of the most well-known formulae in physics. It is a consequence of the theory of special relativity. A direct test of E=mc^2 can be performed by comparing the mass difference between two nuclear states to the energy that is released when a transition between those two states occurs. In this research we will measure the mass difference between two isotopes of chlorine, 35Cl and 36Cl, and compare it to the result of precise gamma ray spectroscopy measurements of the energy released after 35Cl captures a neutron. The atomic masses of 35Cl and 36Cl will be determined using Penning trap mass spectrometry, in which the mass of an ion is measured via the frequency of its motions in a combined magnetic and electric field. At Central Michigan University (CMU) a novel double Penning trap will be constructed and housed inside a 12 tesla superconducting magnet. This apparatus will be used to perform measurements on pairs of ions stored in two identical traps, which will enable the effect of magnetic field variations to be reduced. A comparison of the 35Cl and 36Cl mass difference with the gamma-ray spectroscopy energy measurement will also enable a calibration of gamma-ray energy standards used by detectors in nuclear physics applications in terms of atomic masses. In addition, it can be used to provide a precise determination of two important fundamental constants of nature: the Molar Planck constant and the fine structure constant, and could impact experimental data required for a possible redefinition of the kilogram.<br/><br/>The research program under development at CMU will provide training of Masters and undergraduate students who will gain research experience in modern experimental atomic and nuclear physics techniques, creating an avenue for them to go on to pursue a Ph.D. or enter positions in the technical workforce. The CMU Penning trap will use ions produced by an external ion source and injected into the trap. This will enable many additional precision mass measurements to be performed on a wide range of isotopes, such as those with very low natural abundances, and long-lived radioactive isotopes and isomers, with applications in atomic, nuclear and neutrino physics. The techniques being developed could impact other high sensitivity mass spectrometry applications such as the single-ion Penning trap for rare-isotopes under development at nearby Michigan State University, and mass spectrometers used in national security applications for trace chemical detection."
0.47,"Rob Coalson of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division for computational and theoretical studies of biological ion channels and nanopores. The Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences contributes to the award. The cell uses membranes composed of lipid bilayers to compartmentalize its contents. Specialized proteins insert into the membrane and allow transport through it as required for physiological function. For the cell membrane, the relevant membrane- bound proteins are called ion channels. They selectively pass ions through the membrane and are essential for nerve signal propagation, muscle contraction, auto-regulation of cell volume and production of biochemicals like insulin. The large Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) plays a similar role in regulating the flow of molecular material into and out of the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Residing in the nuclear membrane, NPCs controlthe flow of large biomolecules including proteins and RNAs between the cell nucleus and its cytoplasm. The work to be undertaken here entails large-scale computer simulations of the flow of material through these biological nanopores, using an appropriate level of atomic resolution, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that control these transport phenomena. It has importance for fundamental molecular biology, and ultimately may have relevance to medicine, as serious diseases are associated with improper function of ion channels and NPCs.<br/><br/> When a protein channel spanning a bilayer membrane is in its open state (i.e., is characterized by an appropriate aqueous pore), ions are driven through itby an electrochemical gradient which arises either from a concentration or an electrical potential difference across the membrane. Channel gating is a more complex process. Most gates operate on a time scale of milliseconds to seconds, too long to be simulated via brute force all atom Molecular Dynamics simulation. Understanding these processes requires the development of novel scale-spanning computational techniques. Another intriguing class of biological nanopores is comprised of large protein complexes which span the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. The size and complexity of these Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) present major challenges to molecular modeling analysis. The work to be performed on ion channel modeling will employ a novel divide and conquer multi-scale modeling approach. Molecular level detail extracted from relatively short all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations will be fed into coarse-grained kinetic models. In addition to calculating ion permeation through realistic 3D models of channel proteins, problems involving mechanisms of ion channel gating and the coupling between permeation and gating will be tackled. The work on NPCs entails development of physico-chemically grounded coarse-grained simulation models combined with statistical mechanical analysis. These tools will enable study of larger systems and longer time scales than can be accessed by atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations, namely, mesoscopic scales where collective behavior of many large molecules impacts the pore's ability to select molecular cargos to pass through it."
0.4,"Many areas in physics are entering an information age, with computation at the forefront of research. One of the key notions in this new era is the quantum-mechanical property of entanglement, which characterizes how quantum particles are correlated with each other purely as a result of their quantum-mechanical nature. The influence of inter-particle interactions on entanglement is a challenging question, as interactions (in particular strong ones) drive phase transitions and are responsible for intriguing properties of matter. Information-related quantities, such as the entanglement entropy, play an essential role in quantum phase transitions and are central to seemingly disparate areas, such as quantum computation and black holes. The PI will leverage computational progress in atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics to pursue a deeper understanding of strongly interacting superfluid systems at the interface between those areas, where entanglement properties remain largely unexplored. This project will provide precise predictions of entanglement and its correlation with thermodynamic observables across a wide variety of systems. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged at multiple levels, with emphasis on an ongoing curriculum and track-developing collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.<br/><br/>This project aims for a precise characterization of a wide range of strongly coupled, non-relativistic, few- and many-fermion systems of relevance to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. The systems considered here will include multiple spatial dimensions, free space, harmonic traps, and weakly to strongly interacting regimes. Thermodynamic properties (static, dynamic, structural, and pairing correlations) and their connection to entanglement (entanglement entropies, mutual information) will be determined using non-perturbative approaches, including numerical lattice field theory methods as well as semi-analytic expansions (e.g. the virial and operator-product expansions). To this end, advanced computational methods and algorithms will be implemented and new approaches will be explored to calculate entanglement entropies. The methods (codes, scripts, technical notes) and the data (from auxiliary field configurations to the physical results) will be made available online."
2.2382,"At the high energy frontier in particle physics there are several key, unanswered questions. As yet undiscovered, more massive particles could explain a number of these mysteries. For example, in the universe today, there is much more ordinary matter than antimatter. However, no mechanism of known particle interactions can explain how the universe evolved from the matter-antimatter balance at the time of the Big Bang to the present, highly unbalanced, situation. By making precision measurements, it is possible to detect the echoes of such massive particles, common at the time of the Big Bang, in quantities like the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which just reflects the separation of the neutron's composite positive and negative charges. In addition to advancing our knowledge in particle physics and cosmology, and generating technological progress, this experiment will involve post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students as an essential part, affording the young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their education and training in a forefront area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) is an explicitly time-reversal-violating observable that has played an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics; measured upper limits continue to limit extensions of prevailing models. For example, at present, supersymmetry (SUSY) predicts a value of roughly 10^-25 e-cm for a SUSY mass scale of 1 Teraelectronvolt and maximal mixing. It is clear that measurements at the scale of 10^-28 e-cm as proposed here will provide important input at combinations of very high mass scales and small mixing angles. The neutron EDM is also important for understanding the general pattern of T-(CP-) violation and the cause of the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe.<br/><br/>This experiment, to be performed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline of the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, is based on a technique that is qualitatively different from the strategies adopted in previous measurements. The basic technique in the present experiment involves formation of a three-component fluid of polarized neutrons and Helium-3 atoms dissolved in a bath of superfluid Helium-4 at a temperature T ~ 0.5 K. The ultracold neutrons in this volume, trapped in a plastic measurement cell, are produced by the collision of 8.9 ngstrom neutrons with the phonons of the superfluid. The neutron and Helium-3 magnetic dipoles precess in the plane perpendicular to an applied external magnetic field, B0 in a traditional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance arrangement. The nEDM, dn, is determined by measuring the neutron precession frequency in the presence of a strong electric field, E0. Application of the electric field parallel (antiparallel) to B0 changes the Larmor precession frequency, nu, in proportion to dn. With B0 = 30 milliGauss and E0 = 50 kiloVolt/cm, nu = 88 Hertz and the frequency shift is 4.8 nanoHertz for an EDM of 10^-28 e-cm. Operationally, the neutron precession frequency is measured relative to that of the Helium-3 by taking advantage of the strongly spin dependent nuclear capture reaction and detecting the recoiling proton and triton via scintillation produced in the liquid Helium-4. The polarized Helium-3 atoms (in the same volume as the neutrons) also comprise a co-magnetometer (since any EDM of the Helium-3 atoms is suppressed by its atomic electrons); their precession is observed directly using SQUIDS.<br/><br/>This project provides important training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs as they participate in forefront physics research that stretches across areas including low temperature, atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The results of the experiment potentially impact particle physics as well as astrophysics and cosmology. Some technological developments are expected as several SBIR and STTR grants related to the experimental apparatus have been awarded to date."
1.820663,"This is an exciting time in our quest to understand neutrinos -- fundamental particles that play key roles in the early universe, in cosmology and astrophysics, and in nuclear and particle physics. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. With the realization that neutrinos are massive, there is an increased interest in investigating their intrinsic properties. Understanding the neutrino mass generation mechanism, the neutrino character (Majorana or Dirac), the absolute neutrino mass scale, and the neutrino mass spectrum are some of the main focuses of the immediate future's neutrino experiments. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for the neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. With the goal of ultimately realizing a 1-tonne scale neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay experiment using Germanium (Ge) detectors, the Majorana collaboration is assembling a prototype referred to as the Demonstrator that is intended to confirm that background levels low enough to justify such a large experiment can be reached. The baseline plan for the Demonstrator is for 15 kg of Ge detectors fabricated from Ge enriched in the double-beta isotope 76-Ge. Because most of the cost of such an experiment is the apparatus associated with it and not enriched Ge, and because one can increase the mass of instrumented 76-Ge significantly without increasing that base cost, there is the opportunity to ""increase"" the physics reach of the project for a reasonable, incremental additional cost. This award provides support for extra Ge detectors fabricated from enriched material to improve the physics reach.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technology of larger, lower-background HPGe arrays developed from a tonne-scale experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: direct dark matter searches; measurements for environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities. An E&O program with the Morehead Planetarium on the campus of U. of North Carolina will bring underground science to the public."
0.356671,"This project will create a Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics Network with major nodes at the California Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, Cornell University, and the University of Washington to advance the theory of merging compact-object binaries and stellar collapse. Gravitational waves from these types of events are expected to be detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory in coming years. The network team's goals are to develop the theoretical and computational tools needed to extract the equation of state of dense nuclear matter from gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations, and to determine the impact of compact-object mergers on the synthesis of light and heavy elements. The team will combine its expertise in numerical relativity, nuclear astrophysics, and gravitational wave detection to (1) develop an open-source, next-generation relativistic astrophysics computation framework; (2) improve the theoretical understanding of the nuclear equation of state and compute a large ensemble of equations of state for different temperatures and compositions; (3) improve the computational treatment of nuclear reactions in merger and collapse simulations; and (4) develop parameter estimation techniques to extract information on the equation of state from multi-messenger observations. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of graduate students and postdocs, who will receive cross-disciplinary training in modeling, microphysics, and multi-messenger observations. Outreach videos with visualizations and interviews with project scientists will be disseminated via YouTube to enhance public understanding."
0.309986,"This project will address some of the current challenges in our understanding of the proton: the proton radius puzzle, whereby the highly precise muonic hydrogen measurement of the radius is seven standard deviations from the currently accepted value from electron-based measurements; and measurement of the scalar and spin polarizabilities of the proton. <br/><br/>Recent theoretical calculations of the proton scalar polarizabilities describe the data as well as dispersion-relation-based analyses, but produce a magnetic polarizability twice that of the dispersion analyses. The spin polarizabilities are predicted within many theoretical frameworks, but, until recently, experimental measurement of these properties was unfeasible. We will perform a series of singly- and doubly-polarized Compton scattering measurements to provide a high quality extraction of the scalar polarizabilities, and a world-first independent extraction of all four spin polarizabilities. The measurement program will be carried out within the framework of the A2 Collaboration at the MAinzer MIkrotron accelerator in Mainz, Germany, where the PI is a lead PI on the polarizability program.<br/><br/>The MUon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) at the Paul Scherer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will access the proton radius for the first time via muon scattering, achieving a level of precision comparable with the current electron scattering data. The beam, a mixture of muons, pions and electrons / positrons, will be employed in both charge states and electron and muon scattering data will be taken in parallel. This will allow for an extraction of the radius from both proton and muon elastic scattering to a level of precision comparable with that currently obtained in electron scattering experiments. In so doing, it provides a thorough test of lepton universality, two-photon-exchange corrections relevant to the extraction of the radius from the scattering data and accesses regions where possible beyond standard model physics is postulated to occur. The two photon exchange corrections will be further tested in a complementary dilepton photoproduction experiment at the High Intensity Gamma Source (HIGS) at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) in North Carolina.<br/>--------------<br/>All visible matter with which we interact is formed of atoms, which are in turn composed of neutrons, protons and electrons. We know that the nucleons: the protons and neutrons themselves have substructure: components known as quarks. As these quarks are so strongly bound together, it is impossible for us to pull them apart in order to examine the internal structure and binding of the proton. Instead we have to form theories of how they might be bound together, and make predictions based on those theories which we can test experimentally in order to gain understanding of these building blocks of our everyday lives. It is a little like looking at a catalogue of Lego models and trying to infer the shape and binding mechanisms of the bricks from the possible configurations in the catalogue. We will investigate two properties of the proton in this proposal: its radius and polarizabilities. In so doing, we aim to gain a better understanding of this fundamental building block of the universe and, though it, to better understand the strengths and limitations of current theoretical models of nuclear physics. These models influence many modern technologies such as those involved in nuclear power or radiotherapy treatment, and determine how the stars burn in the sky. <br/><br/>The involvement of undergraduate and graduate research students in international research offers excellent training opportunities both in physics and in international relationships. The leadership of a young female PI will hopefully encourage more individuals from underrepresented groups to consider a career in the natural sciences."
0.0054,"The mobility of fluid and the structure of viscoelastic substances such as gels is important to human health and many key industries. One example of a gel is articular cartilage, the tissue that lines joints and allows for efficient motion such as walking. This study conducts nuclear magnetic resonance correlation studies to characterize the fluid mobility and pore structure of a model cartilage, aiming to identify water and polymer populations in a complex biopolymer system. The information will improve understanding about the relationship between polymer systems and water in a viscoelastic substance. Although these studies focus on cartilage models, many mammalian tissues and many commercial applications are dependent on water and polymer diffusion and how they interact, suggesting potential broad impact to the work. The project is a collaboration with Dr. Petrik Galvosas at the McDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at Wellington University in New Zealand and enables a U.S. graduate student to learn new techniques to expand her skillset as an experimentalist. <br/><br/>Articular cartilage is a mammalian tissue that is not connected to the blood stream and is therefore dependent on molecular mobility of water for nutrient flow and survival. It is also a complex heterogeneous, anisotropic, polymer composite composed of fluid, collagen, and proteoglycans. This study will used Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to characterize the internal structure of a model cartilage, collagen hydrogels, as a function of collagen content.

0.18,"Collisions of neutron stars and black holes are very rare events, but the enormous energies they release in gravitational waves, infrared radiation, X-rays, and gamma-rays make them potentially detectable even when very far away. Their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals contain information about the properties and unknown physics of the colliding objects, but to extract this information, astronomers need theoretical models to which they can compare. For this project, computer simulations will be carried out of systems with a black hole and neutron star orbiting each other and eventually merging. Simulations will also explore the debris commonly produced by black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star mergers: radioactive gas ejected into the surrounding space and hot, magnetized nuclear matter swirling around a black hole. Carrying out these simulations will involve training both graduate and undergraduate students on techniques of computer modeling in relativistic astrophysics. The resulting gravitational wave and nuclear debris data will be made available to all astronomers working to detect and characterize these events. <br/><br/>This research fills some of the most interesting remaining gaps in the modeling of inspiral, disk, and outflow phases of black hole-neutron star binary mergers using simulations with the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), a high-accuracy numerical relativity code that now includes magnetohydrodynamics, nuclear microphysics, and neutrino cooling. Simulations of long inspirals are used to test and improve algorithms for detecting and identifying the gravitational wave signals from such sources. Improvements to SpEC's treatment of flows near black hole horizons enable higher-accuracy accretion disk simulations, and these are used to study the disk dynamics, gamma ray burst, energy extraction, and late-time (tenths of a second) behavior. The project studies outflows for a wide range of binary parameters. The evolution of ejecta far from the post-merger black hole is tracked with smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and nuclear reaction network codes using SpEC data as input, enabling predictions of fallback, kilonova brightness, and nucleosynthesis."

The goal of this research is to exploit the properties of free radicals and clusters of free radicals to develop ways of enhancing the MRI signals from specific molecules using non-toxic, earth-abundant materials so that the transport and fate of those molecules can be studied. This project is part of an international collaboration with chemists in Novosibirsk, Russia and provides an excellent opportunity for introducing under-represented students in the University of Alabama's Chemistry and Research Experience for Undergraduate program to the global science, technology, engineering and math career opportunities of today's economy through planned outreach activities.<br/><br/>Free radicals and biradicals are used in a process known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) to greatly enhance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and MRI signals for molecular imaging and the study of rare molecules and intermediates. The use of DNP is hindered by its high cost and limited performance. Improvements to DNP will be made by the synthesis of much better polarizing agents based on a detailed understanding of the DNP process and the role of the electron spin dynamics of the free radicals that drive DNP. This project involves an international collaboration coupling: 1) experimental studies of free radical spin dynamics and DNP; with 2) theoretical modeling of the role of free radicals in DNP; to 3) guide the synthesis of new free radicals and poly-radicals aimed at improving the practical performance of DNP."

By combining a wide range of data sets, the PI will determine the masses of a sample of resolved nuclear star clusters in nearby galaxies, estimate the masses of a population of nuclear star clusters out to 10 Mpc, and measure the properties of galaxies that host tidal disruption event candidates. The work will subsequently address two key questions in our understanding of galaxy nuclei: (1) how and when do nuclear star clusters form?; and (2) do lower mass galaxies host supermassive black holes?<br/><br/>The PI will also launch an ambitious program to expand the highly successful night-time astronomy program at Bryce Canyon National Park. In particular, the PI will (1) create a ranger talk on nearby galaxies and their nuclei to be used by staff at Bryce, (2) create an astronomy outreach training program for rangers at other parks nationwide so they can replicate Bryce's success, and (3) develop a summer internship program for undergraduate astronomy students. <br/><br/>This work will provide critical contributions to our understanding of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes, as well as the incredibly dense stellar clusters that lie at the centers of galaxies.

0.60075,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Profs. Alexander Pines and Dmitry Budker and their groups at the University of California - Berkeley are developing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in zero magnetic field as a subject of basic research and as a practical tool in chemistry and materials science. This work will uncover new phenomena in magnetic resonance and will eventually free NMR from its reliance upon externally imposed magnetic fields, leading to new technologies in portable NMR for chemical analysis and imaging. At zero magnetic field, nuclear spins in isotropic liquid samples evolve only under the electron mediated scalar couplings (J-couplings) between spins. Despite the absence of chemical shift information in zero-field NMR, the J-couplings are very sensitive to subtle changes in geometry and electronic structure and are thus a source of precise chemical information. As such, a primary goal of this research program is the demonstration of zero-field NMR J-spectroscopy as a technique for high-precision chemical fingerprinting and analysis. Furthermore, in order to disentangle chemical information from complex spectra, efforts will focus on the development of multi-pulse sequences for decoupling and recoupling specific heteronuclear and homonuclear couplings in zero-field multidimensional spectroscopy. This will involve advances in instrumentation and development of a theoretical understanding of average Hamiltonian theory and coherence transfer in the isotropic zero-field environment, as the symmetries are fundamentally different from those encountered in high-field NMR. The research program will also investigate nuclear-spin singlet state dynamics at zero magnetic field as a subject of basic research that will provide insight for the implementation of long-lived hyperpolarized states for biomedical applications.<br/><br/>NMR is a widely used technique in the physical and biological sciences for chemical detection, characterization, and structure elucidation. It is also the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

By employing sensitive atomic magnetometers to measure NMR signals, this work will enable portable and low-cost zero-field magnetic resonance sensors with potential applications ranging from environmental testing to geophysical and space research to medicine to fundamental physics. This project is providing training to graduate and undergraduate students in multiple disciplines, as well as mentoring for postdoctoral researchers, and is catalyzing research collaborations with scientists from the USA and abroad."

In contrast, star-forming galaxies have lower stellar masses and occupy low-density environments.

0.225,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (SSTR) project is the development of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe that will enable research in the field of protein structure determination for dug development and analytical chemistry. The goal is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in measurements taken at room temperature by a factor of 200 using a technique called Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP). This increase in signal-to-noise ratio will reduce the experiment time by a factor of 40,000, and will enable the study of sensitive phenomena not possible with current NMR methods. Current DNP instrumentation and methods require operation at cryogenic temperatures in the range of -180 degrees C, which requires expensive cryogenic systems, and limits the NMR characterization of biologically important proteins that have important dynamics around room temperature (0-20 degrees C). A novel NMR probe will be developed that will enable researchers to achieve the same increase in NMR signal strength at room temperature by improving the delivery of terahertz power to the NMR sample. The NMR probe and methods to achieve the benefits of DNP at room temperature will reduce the cost of cryogenic infrastructure necessary for current DNP setups. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an NMR probe head that uses a novel rotor-resonator integrated with an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) cavity to increase sensitivity by a factor of 200 at room temperature using DNP.

The proposed DNP-NMR probe will enable DNP at room temperature with the following advantages to currently employed cryogenic DNP methods: a) Molecular dynamics (motion) can be determined experimentally; b) molecular structure will not be altered by cryogenic conditions; and c) the spectral resolution will be improved (sharper NMR lines)."

0.0054,"According to a NPR report, 14 percent of the world?s electricity is supplied by nuclear power. The current fleet of 438 reactors spread across 30 nations in addition to the 67 new plants under construction in 15 countries contain a large breadth of specifications, design features, and structural materials. These structural materials must withstand ever increasing amounts of neutron radiation damage in addition to operating in a high temperature and pressure and corrosive degradation environment. Their safety and reliability remain of first importance as reactor lifetimes aspire to be extended. However, they become difficult and expensive to safely handle and test because they become highly radioactive. This radiation has been known to cause unwanted embrittlement and abrupt premature failure. This project focuses on simulating the high dose radiation effect of helium production by focusing a medium energy helium ion beam on a sample at reactor operation temperature. Unlike neutron irradiation in reactors, this technique does not cause the sample to become radioactive, but because the shallow penetration depth of the helium is limited to microns in depth, test samples must be manufactured on this length scale. Micro tensile tests will be performed to investigate the effect of the helium on the grain boundary strength of a structural material commonly used in many nuclear reactors. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Dhriti Bhattacharyya at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in Lucas Heights, Australia who is a radiation damage specialist who has developed a novel in-situ micro-scale tensile testing technique to investigate nuclear structural materials. <br/><br/>Micro-scale tensile testing specimens will be manufactured out of helium implanted engineering alloys using focused ion beam (FIB) milling techniques. These specimens will be tested inside of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in a fashion that will effectively pull apart the material?s grain boundaries in order to test how the helium has effected its grain boundary strength, a strength determining feature crucial to the material remaining intact and reliability during extended service. In addition to providing quantitative mechanical stresses, this technique allows for real time observation of local deformation in real time, providing valuable information concerning the ultimate failure mechanism of reactor components. Selecting of specific types of grain boundaries to investigate and different microstructural features can be made using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and post-test investigations can be performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EBSD to further understand the deformation mechanisms and the distribution of the helium, concerning whether it segregates along the material?s grain boundaries. The methods development of micro-tensile testing will have a wide variety of applications in materials research as a whole, and it will also allow a greater number of labs worldwide to safely conduct research and obtain better statistics with minimal radioactive sample material.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science."
1.821,"At the high energy frontier in particle physics there are several key, unanswered questions. As yet undiscovered, more massive particles could explain a number of these mysteries. For example, in the universe today, there is much more ordinary matter than antimatter.

By making precision measurements, it is possible to detect the echoes of such massive particles, common at the time of the Big Bang, in quantities like the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which just reflects the separation of the neutron's composite positive and negative charges. In addition to advancing our knowledge in particle physics and cosmology, and generating technological progress, this experiment will involve post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students as an essential part, affording the young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their education and training in a forefront area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) is an explicitly time-reversal-violating observable that has played an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics; measured upper limits continue to limit extensions of prevailing models.

It is clear that measurements at the scale of 10^-28 e-cm as proposed here will provide important input at combinations of very high mass scales and small mixing angles. The neutron EDM is also important for understanding the general pattern of T-(CP-) violation and the cause of the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe.<br/><br/>This experiment, to be performed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline of the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, is based on a technique that is qualitatively different from the strategies adopted in previous measurements. The basic technique in the present experiment involves formation of a three-component fluid of polarized neutrons and Helium-3 atoms dissolved in a bath of superfluid Helium-4 at a temperature T ~ 0.5 K. The ultracold neutrons in this volume, trapped in a plastic measurement cell, are produced by the collision of 8.9 ngstrom neutrons with the phonons of the superfluid. The neutron and Helium-3 magnetic dipoles precess in the plane perpendicular to an applied external magnetic field, B0 in a traditional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance arrangement. The nEDM, dn, is determined by measuring the neutron precession frequency in the presence of a strong electric field, E0. Application of the electric field parallel (antiparallel) to B0 changes the Larmor precession frequency, nu, in proportion to dn. With B0 = 30 milliGauss and E0 = 50 kiloVolt/cm, nu = 88 Hertz and the frequency shift is 4.8 nanoHertz for an EDM of 10^-28 e-cm. Operationally, the neutron precession frequency is measured relative to that of the Helium-3 by taking advantage of the strongly spin dependent nuclear capture reaction and detecting the recoiling proton and triton via scintillation produced in the liquid Helium-4. The polarized Helium-3 atoms (in the same volume as the neutrons) also comprise a co-magnetometer (since any EDM of the Helium-3 atoms is suppressed by its atomic electrons); their precession is observed directly using SQUIDS.<br/><br/>This project provides important training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs as they participate in forefront physics research that stretches across areas including low temperature, atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The results of the experiment potentially impact particle physics as well as astrophysics and cosmology. Some technological developments are expected as several SBIR and STTR grants related to the experimental apparatus have been awarded to date."

A potential hydrogen economy is a key player in this market<br/>space. However, hydrogen as a fuel requires efficient storage materials that retain and release<br/>a great deal of hydrogen as desired. This proposal aims to use large scale and accurate quantum<br/>mechanical calculations on an important class of porous hydrogen storage materials: metal-organic<br/>frameworks (MOFs). The research team will study the properties of hydrogen inside of MOFs<br/>and seek to understand their physical properties and how one can design improved MOFs that<br/>should deliver improved storage of hydrogen per unit weight under reasonable and real-world<br/>operating conditions.<br/><br/>To understand and improve MOFs for hydrogen storage applications, it is key to study the microscopic<br/>physical properties of MOFs that govern hydrogen uptake, release, and diffusion<br/>inside the MOFs. This requires simulation of hydrogen inside of MOFs at the atomistic scale.<br/>The project propose to perform highly accurate quantum mechanical simulations of hydrogen dynamics<br/>inside of MOFs using first principles density functional theory to describe the electronic<br/>state of the system coupled to molecular dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom including<br/>quantum nuclear effects (via the path integral formalism). The effect due to the quantum<br/>fluctuations of the nuclear degrees of freedom are critical for understanding the binding<br/>and dynamics of light elements such as hydrogen. The project will use this advanced and accurate theoretical<br/>framework to address three questions of key importance to this field: (1) How do quantum<br/>nuclear effects alter hydrogen dynamics inside of MOFs? (2) How do the transition metal atoms<br/>incorporated into the MOF structure change the hydrogen binding and dynamics properties and<br/>which metals are best for real-world applications? (3) How does the flexibility and temperature-dependent<br/>fluctuations of the MOF framework affect hydrogen storage?<br/><br/>The scientific outcomes of this research will be of interest and importance to researchers<br/>studying MOFs and hydrogen storage.

0.610132,"Embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus can survive for months in the complete absence of oxygen (anoxia). This is especially amazing considering that the embryos are composed primarily of brain and heart tissues, tissues that in mammals are known to rely exclusively on the presence of oxygen to support their metabolism. The unparalleled tolerance of anoxia exhibited by embryos of A. limnaeus makes it an excellent model for these studies. While a great deal is understood concerning the physiology of metabolic dormancy, the master regulators of metabolic depression and factors that increase tolerance of environmental stress during dormancy have to date eluded discovery. The work outlined in this proposal uses modern DNA sequencing techniques to address the following questions of fundamental importance to biology: (1) how are cellular processes reversibly arrested during metabolic depression (2) how can the mitochondrial genome control nuclear gene expression. Preliminary evidence suggests that small regulatory RNA molecules (srRNAs), RNAs less than 25 nucleotides long that do not encode for proteins, may play a critical role in regulating the cellular processes that support tolerance to anoxia in this species. Further, it appears that a number of srRNAs are encoded in the mitochondrial genome and have the potential to regulate the expression of nuclear-encoded genes. In fact, these srRNAs may be responsible for orchestrating the changes in metabolism and cell proliferation associated with the ability to enter into a reversible state of dormancy that is required to survive without oxygen. Next-generation DNA sequencing on the Illumina platform will be used to profile and identify nearly all large (protein coding messenger RNAs) and srRNAs that are actively expressed in embryos during normal development and in response to anoxia. This technique will be applied to embryos that differ substantially in their tolerance of anoxia, and will also be used to identify srRNAs resident within mitochondria isolated from embryos under normoxic and anoxic conditions. The subcellular localization of srRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome during normoxia and anoxia will be described. Bioinformatics analysis will be used to identify putative large RNA targets for regulation by small mitochondrial RNAs. The ability of these mitochondrial srRNAs to confer tolerance of anoxia will be tested in vivo by blocking their action and then screening for changes in tolerance to anoxia. This work has the potential to fundamentally redefine the role of the mitochondrial genome in regulating the basic cellular stress response. The concept that mitochondrially-derived small RNAs can control nuclear gene expression could transform our understanding of basic eukaryotic cell biology. Never before has a direct mechanism for mitochondrial control of nuclear gene expression been outlined, despite many instances associated with diseases where mutations in the mitochondrial genome are known to be associated with changes in nuclear gene expression.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work are manifold. First, it will contribute to the training of a skilled work force that can apply modern tools of biology and bioinformatics to interesting nonmodel systems. The ability to apply the power of modern molecular and genomic-scale techniques to questions of fundamental importance to biology and capitalize on the amazing diversity of organismal form and function is going to transform our understanding of biology. Second, this work has the potential to lead to novel therapies for the treatment of heart attack and stroke in humans and other mammals. Third, A. limnaeus embryos provide an excellent model for ecological and evolutionary developmental biology labs. The PI will continue to develop undergraduate teaching lab projects using these embryos to illustrate the importance of environmental variation on developmental outcomes. These labs and their results will be made available to the general public via the internet. Finally, The PI will continue to participate in outreach educational efforts with the American Killifish Association, a group of several thousand members that are interested in killifish biology and conservation across the globe."
0.38115,"Harnessing the quantum behavior of nanoscopic physical systems is at the center of a broad cross-disciplinary effort driven by the promise of various applications for information processing and secure communication. The prospect of performance gains and increased complexity is driving interest in new devices for existing or new functions (particularly, quantum information processing (QIP) protocols) as well as new paradigms for system architectures beyond present technology. Implementations based on solid-state ""spin complexes"" formed by individual paramagnetic dopants and neighboring nuclear and electronic spins are of particular importance because spin-based quantum technology is well positioned to overcome the obstacles to scaling. Assembling atomically identical spin clusters, however, is unlikely in the near term future, making new protocols necessary to precisely determine the spatial structure of an individual node and selectively address single spins within the complex. In line with these ideas, this grant articulates state-of-the-art nanoscale technology and novel spin manipulation schemes to resolve the network of relative couplings of nuclear spins in the vicinity of the so-called NV center in diamond, arguably one of the most promising platforms for future spintronic and QIP devices. Underlying our effort is the notion of circuits configured to exploit the atomic scale differences between logic units so as to process quantum information in optimal ways. Capitalizing on multi-dimensional spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging schemes, it will be possible to expose the structure and connectivity within the nuclear spin network of a given node in ways resembling the solving of a complex molecular structure. Such information will be crucial to identifying and exploiting long-lived nuclear memories, or to implementing quantum correction protocols without resorting to additional, ad-hoc coupling interfaces. <br/><br/>Besides the technological and scientific advantages, our work is expected to have a broad educational outcome because it will offer students a unique inter-disciplinary scientific training and the ability to interact with a network of collaborating labs. These partnerships not only will provide a broad dissemination platform but also will allow the PI to advance ongoing outreach programs designed to provide meaningful research experiences to underprivileged students through summer activities. These plans gain special meaning at City College, a minority serving institution with a uniquely diverse population of inner-city students. Capitalizing on the various recruitment channels at hand, the teaching, mentoring and career counseling components of this project will truly broaden participation, while encouraging groups underrepresented in the sciences to pursue scientific careers both in academia and in industry."
0.205,"This award provides funding for the development of efficient simulation methods for estimating risk measures and other performance metrics. A primary focus of the research is on variance-reduction techniques (VRTs) for estimating a quantile and constructing confidence intervals for it. <br/>Quantiles are commonly employed to measure risk in a diverse range of application areas. For example, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations sometimes specify that risk is measured using a ""95/95 criterion,"" which requires computing a 95% confidence interval for a 0.95-quantile. To satisfy the NRC requirements, practitioners currently resort to crude Monte Carlo, which can be hugely inefficient, so the research on constructing confidence intervals for quantiles with VRTs has the potential for altering the way uncertainty and safety analyses are performed in the nuclear industry. In finance, where a quantile is known as a ""value-at-risk,"" there are banking rules for capital requirements given as a function of a 0.99-quantile. Other fields in which the research on efficient quantile estimation can be applied include project planning, telecommunications, manufacturing, supply chains, and computing. <br/><br/>If successful, the research will yield new simulation methodologies to increase efficiency, sometimes by orders of magnitude, of estimators of quantiles and confidence intervals for them. The construction of confidence intervals when applying VRTs will involve developing new estimators for the variance constant appearing in the VRT quantile estimator?s central limit theorem. Moreover, other techniques for building confidence intervals for quantiles also will be investigated."

0.4,"CAREER: Combining Nuclear Magnetic Resonance with Integrated Circuit Technology<br/>Nan Sun (The University of Texas at Austin)<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a resonance interaction between atomic nuclei and a radio-frequency magnetic field. It finds a broad array of applications in chemistry, biology, physics, medicine, and material science. Despite its versatility and enormous contributions, existing NMR systems have the constraints of limited sensitivity, low throughput, and long experiment time. In addition, they are bulky, heavy, and expensive. These drawbacks have limited their capability and accessibility. The PI proposes to address the aforementioned limitations and create novel NMR systems with significant performance enhancement and substantial size and cost reduction. To this end, the PI plans to systematically introduce integrated circuit (IC) technology to the field of NMR. IC technology can potentially bring transformational change to the design of NMR coil and transceiver, which are two main components of an NMR system. More specifically, the PI will investigate the following 4 areas: 1) the PI plans to increase the throughput of NMR spectroscopy by developing an integrated probehead that contains a large array of transceivers and planar microcoils, so that many samples can be analyzed simultaneously; 2) the PI aims to create a miniature NMR spectroscopy system by developing a highly-sensitive transceiver IC chip and a small but homogeneous magnet, made possible by a novel hybrid shimming technique; 3) the PI will study wideband integrated transceivers and coils to develop a miniature high-accuracy high-spatial-resolution NMR-based magnetic field sensor; 4) the PI proposes to create a mobile single-sided NMR system by designing a novel multichannel transceiver IC with a multilayer microcoil array. <br/><br/>Broader Impact. The proposed research topics, if successful, will bring major impacts to the NMR field and its broad application fields. For example, an increased throughput for NMR spectroscopy will allow fast screening of combinatorial libraries and accelerate the drug discovery process; a miniature spectroscopy system will enable NMR spectra to be measured on small lab benches and in the field; a low-cost NMR magnetometer will make the usefulness of high-resolution magnetic-field sensing widely accessible; and an integrated sensitive single-sided NMR system will make possible mobile screening of any arbitrary object with reduced experiment time. In addition to the research, the PI plans to actively involve local industry in both teaching and research, develop effective teaching styles, and use state-of-the-art information technology for innovative education.

1.171588,"Nontechnical: Recently developed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy instrumentation provides new opportunities to measure the compositions and structures of technologically important solid-state materials at the level of their atoms. Such capabilities yield new insights that are central to the design, development, and engineering of novel solid-state materials with promise for far-reaching societal or industrial impacts. Specific materials and applications under investigation include high-performance and low-carbon-footprint cements, catalysts for converting biofuels and natural gas to high-value liquid products, organic photovoltaic thin films and nanoscale semiconductors for solar energy conversion, battery and fuel cell materials for electrochemical energy generation and storage, and bio-inorganic solids for sustainable structural materials. Use and understanding of state-of-the-art DNP-NMR instrumentation by students contribute to their education and training across the chemical, physical, materials, and biological sciences. The analyses and applications provide interdisciplinary training that prepares students to address continually-changing energy, environmental, and other needs of society in the broadest of terms. Independent or collaborative access to the integrated DNP-NMR spectrometer by researchers at other regional, national, and international universities extend user base and benefits of the instrument beyond UCSB, in particular to regional partner groups at UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Riverside, and Cal Poly. <br/><br/>Technical: The DNP-NMR instrumentation provides an unprecedented combination of both high signal sensitivity and high spectral resolution for measuring molecular surface species that govern the functions of materials for a broad range of energy, structural, and environmental applications. Among the critical problems and challenges to improving the properties of such materials is the insufficient sensitivity of conventional methods, including NMR, especially for the detection of dilute or surface species. Integrated DNP-NMR measurements provide dramatic NMR signal enhancements of 2 orders of magnitude, resulting in time savings of up to 4 orders of magnitude over that achievable with previous state-of-the-art capabilities. The DNP-NMR instrument represents a breakthrough in molecular characterization that opens new opportunities to characterize and understand heterogeneous functional solids. The scope and goals of the research notably include materials with industrially relevant compositions, synthesized under industrially relevant conditions, and/or materials with low-surface areas or dilute or low-natural abundance species (e.g., 13C, 15N, 29Si, 77Se). The resulting DNP-NMR spectra and analyses are without precedent in the technical literature and enable, for the first time, the molecular-level characterization of complicated compositions and structures of material surfaces that till now have been entirely infeasible by conventional high-field NMR spectroscopy. Such solid-state DNP-NMR capabilities are expected to enable broad and transformative advancements in the materials and chemical sciences and become a standard for molecular characterization of complicated heterogeneous materials, whose surface functionalities are crucial to their properties, but whose molecular origins have previously been exceedingly challenging to establish."

0.090443,"1348361 (Williams), 1348139 (Burger), and 1348341 (Biswas). The Global Nuclear Detection Architecture (GNDA) is intended to detect illicit and unregulated nuclear and radiological materials worldwide. Wide deployment calls for quick and accurate detection technology with sensitivity and resolution close to current state-of-the-art scintillators but at much lower cost. The basic premise of this approach is that there are already inorganic scintillators with light yield and proportionality close to the limits that can be achieved in their ~5 eV band gap range; and that this group haswe developed a predictive model that describes why there is a sweet spot of material parameters defining the current group of highest performance scintillators. This is used to narrow the scope of theoretical, crystal-growth, and evaluative searches in this project so that they can be targeted farther into ternary and quaternary compositions and at the same time deeper into parameters that affect cost and performance. Some of the best new scintillator hosts are in fact composed of abundant (cheap) elements. The reason for their current high cost is not materials, but low yield of growing large single crystals. This project will pursue four research avenues to solve or side-step the crystal growth problems on the way to realizing an economical detector from materials in the sweet spot of structures, compositions, and physical parameters identified from the design rules developed by Wake Forest, Fisk, LBNL, and others since about 2010. One of the approaches to reduce cost examines how to improve the proportionality of segmented index-matched assemblies of smaller crystal blocks that are difficult to grow in large sizes. Such segmented detectors combined with wavelength shifting also provide flexibility to deal with self-absorption (photon diffusion) that currently limits the size of SrI2:Eu detectors. The group will measure and model how the peripheries of blocks in segmented scintillators contribute to nonproportionality, and what can be done to improve it. One ultra-lowcost but high-risk possibility involves index-matched granular scintillators using pre-doped SrI2:Eu beads supplied in bulk by chemical manufacturers. Starting with an excellent scintillator like SrI2:Eu, guided by experience with the segmented scintillators and their modeling, and applying thermal and chemical processing to the beaded material, the group will investigate the physics of what limits the resolution of granular detectors and how to advance performance beyond prior index-matched granular scintillators. A third approach to cost reduction will raise the yield of crystal growth by hardening and toughening existing excellent scintillators while taking care that the hardening measures do not degrade proportionality and light yield. A fourth targets theoretical and experimental searches toward new ternary and quaternary crystals with cubic structures and other properties favoring large crystal growth as well as slow electron thermalization, poor hot electron mobility, good thermalized electron mobility, and low Auger rates leading to best proportionality and light yield. Three university teams bring to this quest their complementary expertise and facilities in (1) crystal growth and characterization, (2) ultrafast laser probes of scintillation and associated numerical modeling of transport, trapping, and nonlinear quenching, and (3) electronic structure calculations on candidate crystals, defects, and dopants. The intellectual merit lies in applying this complementary three university array of experimental and theoretical techniques guided by predictive physical models to attack the cost problem treated in terms of physical parameters alongside those determining proportionality and light yield in both gamma and neutron detectors. The results, positive or negative, will inform the whole field on the models and methods employed. The broader impacts will be to increase national and global security by making possible improved, affordable deployment of nuclear monitoring; increasing the pool of U.S. university graduates trained in the materials technologies necessary to build and deploy such systems widely; and instituting a 3- university bridge system of interacting undergraduate, M.S., and Ph.D. programs and opportunities among the participating universities in three southeastern states to provide a path into the nuclear detection workforce for under-represented and economically disadvantaged students."

The Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences contributes to the award. The cell uses membranes composed of lipid bilayers to compartmentalize its contents. Specialized proteins insert into the membrane and allow transport through it as required for physiological function. For the cell membrane, the relevant membrane- bound proteins are called ion channels. They selectively pass ions through the membrane and are essential for nerve signal propagation, muscle contraction, auto-regulation of cell volume and production of biochemicals like insulin. The large Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) plays a similar role in regulating the flow of molecular material into and out of the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Residing in the nuclear membrane, NPCs controlthe flow of large biomolecules including proteins and RNAs between the cell nucleus and its cytoplasm. The work to be undertaken here entails large-scale computer simulations of the flow of material through these biological nanopores, using an appropriate level of atomic resolution, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that control these transport phenomena. It has importance for fundamental molecular biology, and ultimately may have relevance to medicine, as serious diseases are associated with improper function of ion channels and NPCs.<br/><br/> When a protein channel spanning a bilayer membrane is in its open state (i.e., is characterized by an appropriate aqueous pore), ions are driven through itby an electrochemical gradient which arises either from a concentration or an electrical potential difference across the membrane. Channel gating is a more complex process. Most gates operate on a time scale of milliseconds to seconds, too long to be simulated via brute force all atom Molecular Dynamics simulation. Understanding these processes requires the development of novel scale-spanning computational techniques. Another intriguing class of biological nanopores is comprised of large protein complexes which span the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. The size and complexity of these Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) present major challenges to molecular modeling analysis. The work to be performed on ion channel modeling will employ a novel divide and conquer multi-scale modeling approach. Molecular level detail extracted from relatively short all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations will be fed into coarse-grained kinetic models. In addition to calculating ion permeation through realistic 3D models of channel proteins, problems involving mechanisms of ion channel gating and the coupling between permeation and gating will be tackled. The work on NPCs entails development of physico-chemically grounded coarse-grained simulation models combined with statistical mechanical analysis. These tools will enable study of larger systems and longer time scales than can be accessed by atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations, namely, mesoscopic scales where collective behavior of many large molecules impacts the pore's ability to select molecular cargos to pass through it."

An important mission of this research concerns the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students at Hampton University, one of the historically black institutions. The PI's long-standing involvement with the theoretical and experimental programs at the Jefferson Laboratory provides students with unique learning and research opportunities at one of the premier experimental facilities in the world."
0.1,"A complete understanding of the internal structure of protons, neutrons and other strongly interacting subatomic particles remains elusive. Although Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the relevant part of the Standard Model of particle physics, is an established theoretical framework, it is extremely difficult to perform calculations for phenomena that extend over large distances such as the size of the proton. Lattice-QCD, a numerical first-principles technique that relies heavily on high-performance computational resources, is able to calculate accurately only certain properties of particles such as protons and neutrons. For other properties, researchers rely on physically well-motived phenomenological models. In this broader context, the investigator and his students will develop and apply improved QCD models to study the distribution of constituent quarks and gluons in subatomic particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons. These efforts provide theoretical support to ongoing experimental efforts at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Graduate students involved in this research will be trained in theoretical nuclear physics and will have the opportunity to work on research problems at the forefront of nuclear science, thereby receiving training that prepares them for entering the much-needed workforce in the nuclear science arena. <br/><br/>The Dyson-Schwinger equations approach to nonperturbative model building in QCD preserves the short distance renormalization group behavior of QCD, while modeling in the infrared domain is guided by an empirical approach that preserves the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking known to generate at least 98% of the mass of visible stable matter in the universe. This approach is checked against established results of Lattice-QCD and is used to extend and complement Lattice-QCD for domains where lattice results are not presently available. This work will analyze and interpret experimental results about the quark and gluon structure of sub-atomic particles and elastic and transition form factors. This project will also develop an improved practical method for solving the QCD bound state equation for excited state mesons and will explore the limitations of a recently proposed approximate approach to parton distributions for Lattice-QCD."
0.5263,"The present NSF grant primarily funds the RPI group's participation in the the physics program of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, where it is a member of the CLAS Collaboration. The experimental program's goal is to learn about and image the composition of protons and neutrons - generically called nucleons - which comprise nearly all the currently visible matter in the universe. Nucleons are composed of very complicated arrays of quarks immersed in the strong nuclear fields called gluons.<br/><br/> The main instrument used is the CLAS spectrometer, inside of which a beam of electrons from the Jefferson Lab accelerator impinges upon a target of protons. Most often the target is in the form of liquid hydrogen atoms. The experiments in which the RPI group are focusing are those in which an electron in the beam strikes and scatters off a proton and part of the energy imparted to the proton produces either a single photon (a quantum of electromagnetic radiation), or a single meson, which is a particle consisting of a quark and antimatter quark pair. By studying this reaction as the imparted energy and direction of the scattered electron is varied, the group seeks to obtain a three dimensional image of the distributions of the quarks in the proton, which has never yet been accomplished.<br/><br/> During this grant period the group will continue work on a new CLAS spectrometer, called CLAS12, which is part of the ongoing project at Jefferson Lab to double the energy of the electron beam. The component of the CLAS12 spectrometer on which the RPI is specifically contributing is called a high threshold Cherenkov counter (HTCC), which will be used to identify the scattered electrons. This is in addition to the more general role the Principal Investigator plays in the upgrade as chairman of the CLAS12 steering committee.<br/><br/> RPI is a technology based university whose primary goal is to prepare future scientists and engineers for the most advanced technological demands of society. The complexity of the experiments in this research require the development and use of the most advanced scientific equipment and computational techniques. RPI graduate and undergraduate students, as well as post-doctoral associates, participate one way or another in programs such as this, and in the present case directly carry out most of the direct work on the experimental program, enabling them to become the scientific and engineering leaders of a technologically competitive society."
0.617629,"Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe and yet we do not know many of their properties. For example, we do not know their absolute mass scale or their particle-antiparticle nature. Because of their abundance, even a small mass could have far-reaching consequences for understanding their role in the evolution of our Universe. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles could have implications in understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our Universe.<br/><br/>Neutrino-less double beta decay (NLDBD) experiments address these two fundamental questions. Double beta decay is a rare nuclear decay that has been measured in several nuclei when it is energetically favorable. Some nuclei are stable against ordinary beta decay but are unstable for double beta decay in which two neutrons in the nucleus are simultaneously converted to protons and two electrons are emitted. Double beta decay can proceed through several modes. The experimentally measured process, the two-neutrino mode in which two electron antineutrinos are also emitted, is completely described by known physics. NLDBD is an as-yet-undetected decay that involves no neutrinos in the final state and necessarily would indicate that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. The rate of such decays determines the scale for the effective neutrino mass.<br/><br/>The CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) experiment at the Gran Sasso laboratory (LNGS), Assergi, Italy, is one of the next generation experiments to search for NLDBD. It uses the 130-Te isotope with a design sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass ranging between 40-70 meV, depending on nuclear structure calculations. The UCLA group's major hardware responsibilities include the testing of all the front-end electronics and the installation and commissioning of the electronics system at LNGS in collaboration with the Milan and South Carolina groups. Their analysis focus will be on understanding of the residual background sources through Monte Carlo simulations.<br/><br/>The technology being used in CUORE which is based on milliKelvin bolometry is one of the most innovative and largest scale in the field. If their electronics proves out as designed, it will likely influence other fields. The NLDBD experiments address fundamental physics issues that have a scientific impact beyond particle and nuclear physics. For example, if neutrinos are Majorana particles and neutrino masses are from the See-Saw Mechanism, the lepton sector could violate CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry and contribute to the matter and anti-matter asymmetry of the Universe. The group will also help train undergraduate and NSF-REU students in their research programs and provide them with research experiences in neutrino physics and modern detector technology."
0.2,"Quarks are elementary particles that are strongly bound inside protons and neutrons. The residual strong interactions between protons and neutrons give rise to all of nuclear physics, from the simplest nuclear reactions responsible for fusion, to the intricate structure of large unstable nuclei. In essence, nuclei are to the strong 'chromodynamic' force what molecules are to the electromagnetic force. Tremendous progress is being made by solving the theory of strong interactions numerically. Current computing power and algorithms have put one within reach of realistic computations. Quantitative knowledge of the strong force will ultimately render nucleons and nuclei into laboratories for investigating fundamental symmetries and probing the limits of the Standard Model of particle physics. The comprehensive research program of the PI will combine advances in theoretical physics and high-performance computing to help advance our knowledge about nucleons and nuclei to the most advanced level yet. Moreover, the scope of this program affords both student and post-doctoral researchers considerable opportunities for training in nuclear and computational science, two areas in which an advanced technical workforce is much needed.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to study electromagnetic and parity-violating properties of strongly bound systems directly from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The distribution of charge and magnetism within nucleons will be explored by calculating their magnetic moments and electromagnetic polarizabilities using lattice gauge theory. Effort will also be geared toward studying the electromagnetic structure of light nuclei and hyper-nuclei using lattice QCD techniques, including the challenge of reducing the quark mass. Manifestations of the weak interaction at low energies will additionally be investigated from QCD. The parity-violating component of non-leptonic weak interactions introduces hadronic parity violation, and probes quark-quark correlations deep within hadrons. Due to feasibility of lattice QCD computations in the isotensor channel, lattice renormalization of isotensor parity violation will be determined and electromagnetic mixing will be addressed for the first time. Novel methods will be sought for future lattice calculations in the remaining isospin channels."
0.522,"We will perform several measurements that can establish the properties of the high energy density matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions at both the Relativistic Heavy ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Specifically, we will probe the properties of this matter by studying the collective flow and jet quenching phenomena. In earlier work, we have shown that this matter not only exhibits significant harmonic flows of many orders arising from the density fluctuations in the initial collision geometry, but also exhibits strong jet-medium interactions as well as a response of the medium to the quenched jets. Our future efforts will be aimed at establishing a more quantitative understanding of the microscopic mechanisms for the flow and and jet-medium interactions. We plan to achieve this goal by finishing ongoing data analyses as well as by pursuing new measurements. They include: 1) Ongoing and future experimental and phenomenological efforts to constrain the mechanisms for harmonic flow and the nature of the density fluctuations in the initial collision geometry. 2) Future efforts to understand the jet-quenching response to the density fluctuations and to search for medium response to quenched jets. These projects are built upon our established expertise in single particle measurements and jet correlation measurements.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: These experiments will improve our quantitative understanding of collective behavior and jet-medium interactions, and hence provide invaluable constraints for determining the fundamental properties of high-density nuclear matter under the most extreme conditions.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Studies of high energy density matter can have a profound impact on our understanding of the strong force in nuclei and the evolution of the early universe, supernova explosions and the properties of neutron stars. The experimental results on jet quenching and medium response at RHIC and LHC have inspired important new developments in super-string theories. Both the PHENIX and ATLAS experiments at these facilities provide excellent training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students. In addition, the PI is also actively contributing to undergraduate education in nuclear science by teaching in the annual BNL Nuclear Chemistry Summer School."
0.15,"Most nuclei are unstable and have limited lifetimes. Understanding the structure of nuclei far from stability and defining the limits of the heaviest elements has been an exciting challenge and has led to the production of nuclei with as many as 118 protons using both hot and cold fusion techniques as well as radioactive beams. This award will use the multi-nucleon transfer technique to synthesize new actinide nuclei. The investigators will also measure the properties and production mechanisms of the heaviest nuclei to understand the nature and behavior of these nuclei, and to assist theoretical predictions for the stability, structure and production of super-heavy elements. The project will contribute to the education of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The training of scientists in nuclear and radiochemistry fulfills a well-articulated, frequently stated national need, the re-vitalization of nuclear and radiochemistry.<br/><br/>There are three phases of the research: (a) to investigate the use of multi-nucleon transfer (MNT) reactions in the region near 208Pb to test models of these reactions and to make new nuclei. These investigations are to be done with thick target experiments at Gammasphere (136Xe + 208Pb and 136Xe, 238U + 198Pt). In the former experiment, one is making a unique rigorous test of the Zagrebaev and Greiner formalism for treating MNT reactions while the latter reactions deal with the best way to make N=126 nuclei (b) to study the production of lower Z actinide nuclei testing current models of MNT. This will involve the identification of 15-30 alpha-emitting nuclear products from the 132Xe + 233U reaction by in-beam spectroscopy and off-line analysis and a study of similar products from the 192Os + 197Au reaction and (c) to study the production of exotic neutron-rich actinide nuclei at the limits of stability using transfer reactions such as 136Xe+ 248Cm and 232Th + 248Cm. Several new n-rich isotopes of Fm, Cm, and Cf will be produced."
0.021981,"Nuclei are the basic building blocks of matter. The entire Universe is composed of nuclei and understanding their properties allows us a glimpse into how the Universe transformed itself to support life. One way to study the properties of nuclei is by exciting and de-exciting the nuclear system. This research focuses on analyzing the lifetimes of the quantum states in deformed nuclei. This project will also contribute to training the next generation of scientists by actively engaging undergraduate students in research at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UW-L).<br/><br/>The nature of low-lying excitations, K = 0+ bands in deformed nuclei remain enigmatic in the eld. This project focuses on the search for vibrational excitations in deformed nuclei. The UW-L Nuclear Science Group has recently measured the lifetimes of states in 162Dy during the period of the grant, the group will analyze the results and interpret the implications the measurements. The UW-L Nuclear Science Group will also conduct detector work during the academic year in a small local laboratory. The results will be broadly disseminated through publications and conference presentations by the PI and undergraduate researchers."
0.045079,"The neutrons and protons that make up the nucleus of every atom are themselves made up of constituent particles called quarks and gluons, and held together by what we call the strong nuclear force. This award supports research to the study of the strong interactions between those elementary constituents of matter. More specifically, it is aimed at understanding the properties of the theory of the strong force, named Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD, at energies where nucleons are formed and it is most relevant,. To this end, the PI and the students supported by this award will perform experiments at The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab,) in Newport News, VA. NSU faculty and undergraduate students will participate in the construction of hardware and in the analysis of data from experiments in the forefront of intermediate energy nuclear physics. Norfolk State University is one of the leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities. NSU graduates more African-American physics majors than all of the other Virginia universities combined. It is a goal of this project to strengthen the national participation of undergraduate minorities in nuclear and particle physics research.<br/><br/>In the recent years, numerical solutions of QCD (Lattice-QCD) have provided with a mass spectrum of light-mass mesons. Therefore, it is time for improving our experimental determination of the poorly known light-mass meson spectrum to compare with predictions. Since the interaction carrier of the strong interaction, the gluon, is sensitive to the strong interaction, it is also possible that gluons can be externally observable in the meson spectrum as exotic mesons (particles made of a quark, an antiquark and a gluon). One main question in meson spectroscopy is: Can we find hints of the gluon in the meson spectrum? The PI is analyzing data from meson spectroscopy experiments performed with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) in Jefferson Lab's Hall B to search for those hints. He is also involved in two new experiments named GlueX and CLAS12, at the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade. Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) is the technique used for that analysis. The first PWA results have been published and more PWA results are progressing in several channels. The main work is in developing and upgrading new techniques of amplitude and partial wave analysis."
0.747639,"A pulsed DNP/NMR/ESR (DyNE) spectrometer for the structural studies of macroscopically aligned membrane proteins under their native-like physiological conditions will be developed. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) allows one to obtain atomic-resolution structures of membrane proteins and membrane-bound receptors in their native lipid environment without the need of crystallization. The current disadvantage of ssNMR is its relatively low sensitivity due to small polarization of the nuclear spins at the available magnetic fields. This main drawback will be addressed by employing and optimizing the Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) method that transfers the larger polarization from the electronic spins to the nuclei, thereby achieving several hundred-fold enhancements of the NMR signals. DNP is rapidly revolutionizing the field of NMR of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic surfaces, but its applications to biological macromolecules remain fairly limited. This project is focused on developing the DNP instrumentation that will be specifically suited for the structure-function studies of membrane proteins under their physiologically relevant conditions (i.e., full hydration at 37 C). To achieve these goals, the expertise of the PI (Nevzorov) in high-resolution structural studies of membrane proteins by ssNMR will be combined with the expertise of the Co-PI (Smirnov), who is a pioneer of using lipid nanotube arrays for stabilizing membrane proteins and an expert in building millimeter-wave instrumentation and probeheads for electron-spin resonance (ESR). <br/>The development of the DyNE instrument will take place at the interface of magnetic resonance, membrane protein biophysics, and nanotechnology. Such an instrument would become an invaluable tool for a diverse group of researchers ranging from biophysicists to structural biologists and medicinal chemists studying the interactions of small-molecule therapeutics with membrane protein receptors. In the course of this development project graduate students will obtain an interdisciplinary training ranging from advanced NMR and ESR methods to biophysical experiments with membrane proteins and preparation of hybrid nanomaterials. The results from this instrumentation development will be disseminated through interdisciplinary educational initiatives including the existing undergraduate and graduate level courses at NCSU as well as by collaborating with biologists, chemists, and physicists on the structural studies of membrane proteins by utilizing this unique instrumentation."
0.44358,"With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program is supporting the research of Chandrasekhar Ramanathan of Dartmouth College to develop new techniques to study and understand the physical and chemical properties of surfaces. A number of important processes occur at the surface of materials. For example, catalysis?such as occurs in solar energy conversion processes or in catalytic converters?takes place on the surface of the catalyst. A detailed understanding of the structure of solid surfaces and their interfaces to other media is critical to the development of new catalysts and other technologies, such as highly sensitive sensors that can be used, for example, to measure groundwater contamination or detect explosives. This research develops methods based on nuclear magnetic resonance (the technology behind magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI) and applies that technique to the study of small-scale materials. The goal is to characterize the structure of these surfaces with high spatial resolution. The resulting information is then used to selectively activate specific sites on the surface to improve on their catalytic or sensing properties. The research is having a broad impact through the development of useful new technologies that will have a variety of applications in many areas. It is having a further impact through programs in local science pubs and cafes designed to communicate the science involved to a broad societal audience. <br/><br/>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods are being developed to study the physical and chemical properties of surfaces and interfaces. To compensate for the low sensitivity of NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization techniques (DNP) are being designed and optimized to both maximize the signal enhancements for surface spin species, as well as to obtain information about the local spatial ordering of the spins at nanometer and sub-nanometer length scales. In particular, the use of endogenous and exogenous polarizing agents for DNP of surface functionalized groups in silicon and silica micro- and nano-particles are being compared. Hyperpolarization is being combined with static multiple-pulse NMR techniques such as multiple-quantum spin counting experiments to probe the local ordering of the surface spins in these systems. The newly developed methods are being applied to systems such as nanoparticle surfaces and atomistically-thin layers such as Langmuir-Blodgett or functionalized graphene films, using both endogenous and exogenous polarizing agents. The goal of these studies is to get a better quantitative estimate of the size of the quenched region, the polarization transfer rates and atomic level detail about the local DNP process. A better understanding of these phenomena could, in turn, enable the use of optimal control techniques to selective excite and study certain chemical species, allowing selective maximization of enhancements."
0.345,"The research objective of this award is to determine how opposing mechanical elements of the nucleus help maintain proper shape of the organelle which houses the DNA. The nucleus of mammalian cells has a peripheral network of lamin filaments that provides stiffness. Preliminary results show that alpha II-spectrin provides mechanical resilience or recoil, which may be described as a ""spring"". Studies conducted under this award will test the mechanisms of this spring hypothesis by quantifying recovery of nuclei in cells under force. The force responsiveness of the lamin network and subnuclear components including the DNA will be observed during mechanical testing in cells that have been depleted of alpha II-spectrin. Also, binding partners will be determined for alpha II-spectrin using purified proteins and protein fragments so that a more accurate description of the architecture can be identified. <br/><br/>Although strength and stiffness is important at every level of physiology, mechanical recoil and resilience also plays an important role in maintaining proper homeostasis. Here, the discovery and investigation of alpha II-spectrin as a nuclear mechanical spring will allow a thorough understanding of integrated cellular mechanics and mechanobiology. If successful, these studies will advance the understanding of nuclear structure, gene expression and mechanical responsiveness of cells. Also, results may provide insights into the large number of human diseases and progressive dystrophies associated with lamins and other nuclear structural proteins. The education plan focuses on enhancing ethics training for undergraduate researchers. To directly impact students from underrepresented groups nationally and internationally, advanced online learning initiatives in Anatomy and Physiology are being developed as a supplement for community college education in pre-medicine."
0.135,"This proposal funds the research activities of Assistant Professor Jack Laiho at Syracuse University. Laiho's research focuses on precision studies of the interactions of quarks via the strong and weak nuclear forces. These forces are a part of the enormously successful Standard Model of particle physics. In order to compare the predictions of the Standard Model with experimental observations large-scale supercomputer calculations are required to correctly account for the effects of the strong nuclear force using an approach called Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Theoretical predictions of the Standard Model are compared with experimental results obtained from particle accelerator experiments, thus testing our understanding of the laws of nature. So far, good agreement has been found. While it is satisfying that the current framework describes matter and its interactions so well, it is known from cosmology that there is physics not accounted for within the Standard Model. The discovery of discrepancies between the Standard Model predictions and experiments done at particle colliders would be very exciting, as such results could lead to an understanding of the mysteries that are not explained in the current framework, including why there is as much matter in the universe as there is. A broader impact of this research is that the Lattice QCD ensembles used by the PIs are made publicly available and are used by other researchers studying quark interactions throughout the world. Additionally, knowledge of computational methods and problem solving skills needed to perform research in lattice field theory are useful assets for graduate students, whether they continue in academic research positions or get jobs in the private sector.<br/><br/>Laiho's research focuses on calculations using Lattice QCD that are needed to maximize the impact of high-energy particle physics experiments. This includes lattice calculations of heavy-light and light-light weak matrix elements, quantities where one needs to control the effects of non-perturbative QCD. This work makes use of high performance computing facilities throughout the US, and is used for calculations of Standard Model predictions that are needed for comparisons with experimental observations as part of the search for new physics. Laiho also has an interest in applying lattice methods to the study of quantum gravity to try to determine whether or not a quantum field theory of gravity is renormalizable when formulated nonperturbatively. The Lattice QCD calculations funded by this grant are essential to make best use of the existing and planned experimental facilities including LHCb and Belle II. They can help to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model, and they provide insight into the workings of the strong nuclear force and quark interactions. The research on gravity might lead to an understanding of how to handle another nontrivial theory using lattice methods in the non-perturbative regime."
0.179785,"Dr. Leah Minc, of Oregon State University, and an international team of collaborators will explore the origins of market-place exchange and the specific political and social conditions fostering market systems in ancient economies. Although markets are a fundamental part of modern economy, scholars question whether similar commercial exchange systems developed in ancient societies and debate which factors stimulated their emergence and growth in non-western economic traditions. From the perspective of modern microeconomic theory, some researchers have argued that commercial exchange and a complex division of labor evolved naturally in complex societies as an efficient solution to provisioning large populations with essential goods, once political stability ensured freedom of movement and rule of law. Other scholars, in contrast, dispute the applicability of the modern mind-set (including assumptions of economic rationality, competition, and profit motive) to non-western or pre-industrial societies. For example, some historians question whether in highly stratified societies, where control over the means of production (land and labor) was firmly held by the ruling class, production and exchange built on profit incentives could reasonably develop among the peasantry, or whether in these cases alternative forms of exchange (such as extended family networks) might provide a means for acquiring needed commodities. Archaeology is well poised to evaluate the universality of micro-economic assumptions, by examining the evidence for market exchange in the distant past, as well as the political and social context for its development and the possible persistence of alternative forms of exchange that supplied communities with necessary materials. <br/><br/>This collaborative project will examine a pristine case of market system development by using nuclear science and geochemical techniques to trace exchanges of basic, utilitarian goods. The project will focus on the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, home to one of the best documented early state societies in the New World, and will explore how key political events affected regional economic interaction and integration through time. Drawing on excavated collections of domestic pottery from communities throughout the valley, the research team will use robust methods of trace-element analysis (instrumental neutron activation analysis) to establish where ceramic vessels were manufactured, map their movement from producer to consumer, and assess the spatial scale, organization, and intensity of intra-valley exchange across key periods of state emergence and consolidation (from ca. 700 BC through 550 AD). The observed distribution patterns will provide a sound foundation from which to re-assess specific models of market system evolution, as well as a means for future studies to address how these economic changes affected households' production, consumption, and exchange decisions. Further, the intersection of archaeology and nuclear science will create opportunities for STEM education and professional training for students in the social sciences; at the same time, due to its ""human appeal,"" archaeometric research can build support for nuclear science, engaging public interest and justifying infrastructure and lab equipment upgrades."
0.371999,"This is a theoretical and numerical study of nonlinear interactions between waves and vortices in two subject areas: atmosphere ocean fluid dynamics relevant to climate science, and plasma physics relevant to tokamak dynamics and nuclear fusion. Common to these interaction problems are the huge inherent scale separations between the different dynamical components of the flow, which render a direct numerical simulation hopeless and which also introduce a stochastic component to the system dynamics because the small-scale components are only partially observable. Hence the study involves the mathematical investigation of various systems of multidimensional nonlinear PDEs using a combination of asymptotic analysis, stochastic modeling, and numerical computation, all with an eye towards ultimate applications in the real world that are relevant to climate science and nuclear fusion. Specifically, the study consists of three projects. The first considers a special kind of small-scale internal gravity wave in the ocean and its interactions with mean currents near the sea floor, the second considers random particle motion induced by deep-ocean internal waves in the presence of forcing and dissipation, and the third investigates the wave-turbulence jigsaw puzzle posed by interactions between strong drift waves and strong zonal flows in the problem of plasma confinement in tokamaks.<br/><br/>Atmosphere ocean dynamics relevant to climate science contains a vast span of active dynamical scales, from millimeters and milliseconds associated with sound waves to planetary scales and decades associated with large-scale ocean circulations, for example. All these scales are dynamically coupled together through a wide variety of nonlinear interactions and this is where fundamental mathematical theory can make a decisive contribution, namely by reducing these interactions into more tractable and understandable components that can then be simulated with significantly greater ease. Analogous comments apply to plasma dynamics that is relevant to fusion research and the behavior of tokamak devices. Hence, results from this theoretical study may feed into the future design of next generation atmosphere ocean forecasting systems for weather and climate, which is of great societal importance, and they should also strengthen the fundamental principles that feed into the design of nuclear fusion devices in tokamaks."
0.448329,"1150588<br/>Di Carlo<br/><br/>The mechanical properties of cells, the underlying origins of these properties in cytoskeletal & intracellular structure, and the relationship of this structure with disease states has been a rapidly expanding area of research. Purely biophysical (mechanical) measurements can help uncover fundamental associations between disease and cell architecture, and these properties have been shown to be powerful label-free biomarkers for cell phenotype. For example, a measure of shape changes in response to force (deformability) has been shown to be indicative of malignant transformation in cell lines and human biopsy samples. However, previous studies have been limited to proof-of-concept applications by the low-throughput analytical technologies employed. Applications in biophysics research, clinical diagnostics or drug screening necessarily require large sample sizes to obtain statistically significant data - leading to sensitive and specific results. The PI aims to address the low throughput and complexity of current measurement techniques using a next generation instrument to assay the mechanical properties of thousands of single cells in minutes achieving the ease-of-use and throughput of flow cytometry. The PI has started to address this challenge using continuous microfluidic stretching of cells in an extensional (purely stretching) flow - i.e. ""Deformability Cytometry"". The PI has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for deforming >1000 cells per second, which is orders of magnitude higher than gold standard mechanical measurement techniques. Extending the development of this instrument, the PI proposes to provide high-throughput and systematic data to the cell biophysics and bioengineering communities that can aid in understanding the roles of biomolecules in cellular integrity, and ultimately suggest currently unknown connections to clinical diagnostic applications.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The mechanical properties of cells have been thought to be largely determined by cytoskeletal elements with the highest stiffness (namely actin and microtubules). Recently, intermediate filaments, nuclear envelope proteins and chromatin structure have been suggested to contribute significantly to cell mechanical properties. For example, pluripotent stem cells and activated lymphocytes are known to lack the nuclear membrane proteins lamin A/C and have less condensed chromatin. It remains an open question whether these characteristics are responsible for the high observed deformability in these cells. The PI's innovation is to investigate the combination of these elements on whole-cell large-scale deformation, without bias for dominant origins in the traditionally examined cytoskeleton. It is clear that the interplay between these elements may control mechanical behavior in some cells, while a sole element may dominate response in other cells (for example chromatin structure in lymphocytes with large nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios). A simple to use and high-throughput instrument will allow a systematic survey of these contributors, alone and as part of a potential linked mechanical network, which will be a boon to the bioengineering and biophysics communities attempting to address the fundamental origin of cell mechanical properties.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>A label-free mechanical measurement of cell state can help address the high cost of healthcare by eliminating the cost of antibody labels and reducing the technician labor associated with preparing labeled samples for diagnostics. Further, such an approach could improve quality of life by increasing our diagnostic capabilities - leading to the identification of the correct treatment quickly. Educational and dissemination activities will be seamlessly integrated with the proposed research. These activities will be focused in areas addressing a variety of stakeholders including the (i) undergraduate and graduate student community, (ii) the microfluidics community, and (iii) the broader public. The four education and dissemination activities include: (1) Graduate and undergraduate exposure to high-speed camera operation and microfluidics in collaboration with UCLA's CEED (Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity). (2) Summer undergraduate internships to assist financially disadvantaged undergraduates to become involved in research. (3) An online community for sharing and discussion of microfluidic designs. (4) An online YouTube gallery of ""cool"" slow-motion scientific and illustrative videos (e.g. water balloons filled with different viscosity fluids thrown against a wall) to engage and excite the public."
0.417391,"In this project funded by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Sophya Garashchuk, at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, is developing new theoretical methods to analyze the dynamics of molecular motion. This method combines the microscopic behavior of electrons in molecules, treated by quantum mechanics with the motion of the nuclei of the atoms treated by classical mechanics, following that of Isaac Newton. The quantum-mechanical treatment of electrons is important and crucial to understand chemical reactivity, optical, magnetic and other properties of molecules. More importantly these new methods will allow researchers to investigate larger systems such as nanomaterials. Potential applications include photovoltaic materials that convert light to electricity, movement of atoms and molecules through membranes, and isotopic separation. <br/><br/>The scientific goal is to develop a practical methodology for systems of 10-200 atoms, which incorporates Nuclear Quantum Effects (NQEs) for certain nuclei or modes of motion (quantized vibrations, rotations), while they fully interact with the remaining classically-described nuclei. Drawing on the ideas from the quantum trajectory formulation of the Schrodinger equation, we will develop a trajectory-based theoretical framework of including NQEs selectively within a larger molecular environment, transform the concepts into computer codes and through simulations advance our understanding of molecular systems, such as those mentioned above, known to exhibit isotope and other NQEs. Broader educational goals are to train junior researchers in theoretical, computational chemistry, and high performance computing, to facilitate use of computational chemistry tools by experimental colleagues through formal teaching and collaborative projects, and to provide access and training in computational chemistry tools for undergraduate institutions in South Carolina."

Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research."
0.398279,"In this project, a group of investigators participating in the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic expedition will determine the concentrations of a suite of anthropogenic (human-made) radioisotopes in the Arctic Ocean. Anthropogenic radioisotopes are unstable forms of elements that have a human-made origin; they may leak into the environment as by-products of nuclear weapons testing or nuclear energy production. In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Results from this research will help to characterize distinct contaminant sources for anthropogenic radioisotopes and identify the influence of important mechanisms that lead to their observed distributions in the Arctic. Researchers will collaborate with the NSF-funded Polar Learning and Responding Climate Change Education Partnership in order to develop web-based spatial tools for sharing results of their work with students and the general public.<br/><br/>Although a significant amount of work has been done in the Arctic, data sets on radionuclides are entirely lacking in some cases or limited with respect to particular elements or isotopes of interest including characterization of different sources, water column, sea ice, and sediments. The U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic section offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the sources, fate and transport of anthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic, a region that has been heavily impacted by nuclear industrial activities and exhibiting dramatic and rapid responses to global climate change. Using a comprehensive, multi-tracer approach, these researchers will determine the concentrations of a suite of anthropogenic radionuclides, including cesium-137, cesium-134, plutonium-239, plutonium-240, and neptunium-237 in a variety of different types of samples from the Arctic. This study will provide information on the horizontal and vertical distributions of the anthropogenic radionuclides of interest, which will substantially add to the global data set, constrain the budgets of several anthropogenic radionuclides through collaboration with European colleagues, and address not only the transport and fate of these contaminants in the Arctic, but also provide insight into the dominant processes that affect them. The data will support efforts in data modeling, which will integrate the dissolved and particulate anthropogenic radionuclides data on a basin-wide basis, and then compare and evaluate the contributions from different oceanic processes as well as the influence of sources of contamination."
0.279926,"As the Earth's climate becomes warmer and more variable, characteristics that help organisms cope with stress will become increasingly important. This research investigates beetles living at high elevation in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California to study how variation in genes coding for proteins that process energy and respond to stress affect metabolism and performance. The research seeks to discover the contrasting roles of oxygen, which is necessary to process metabolic fuel, and temperature, which changes the rate at which these processes occur. It is a synthesis of genomics, physiology, and animal natural history that will provide a unique opportunity to understand how organisms cope with environmental change. It will provide insight into the evolution of thermal plasticity and may unveil novel genes associated with temperature and oxygen stress. The work will increase research opportunities for students at two primarily undergraduate universities. Students will be trained in experimental design and analysis, proposal and paper writing, and in the presentation of research at scientific meetings, which will provide them with marketable skills for the modern work environment. Educational materials will be developed for K12 education, which illustrate the use of genomic tools for answering scientific questions. Outreach events detailing the results of this project will occur at public events in the San Francisco Bay Area and near field sites in Inyo County, California.<br/><br/>This project will develop and use genomic and transcriptomic tools to gain mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of adaptation to temperature and atmospheric oxygen in the Sierra willow leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis. This research will test the hypothesis that interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have pervasive effects on gene expression that scale up to differences in metabolic capacity and performance. To test this hypothesis, the stress response will be investigated in larvae from populations that differ with respect to mitochondrial and nuclear genetic background and that occur along a latitudinal and steep altitudinal temperature gradients. Larvae will be reared at a high elevation laboratory in chambers where oxygen level and temperature will be manipulated. At the end of the growth period, larvae reared under these different conditions will be exposed to different temperatures and running speed measured. Genetic variation associated with fast and slow running speed after stress will be identified using whole genome sequencing of individuals in the upper and lower tails of the running speed distribution. Differences in expression of genes of interest will be assessed using RNA sequencing for these same individuals. Genes of interest (e.g. stress, hypoxia, central metabolism) that have non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation along natural temperature or elevation gradients will be identified in whole genome sequencing experiments and used to build 'SNP panels' in which larger numbers of individuals can be screened. Rearing conditions described above will then be used to generate larvae in which metabolic physiology will be examined. Metabolic enzyme activity, mitochondrial respiration, oxidative damage and thermal tolerance will be measured, SNP variation recorded, and differential expression of genes of interest quantified using quantitative PCR. Taken together, this research will reveal how mitochondrial and nuclear genomes interact to cope with stress in a changing environment. The project will establish a new international collaboration with world leading experts in insect genomics from Stockholm University (Sweden). International collaborators will help organize and lead a two-week hands-on workshop on genomics and bioinformatics for undergraduate and Masters students from Santa Clara University and Sonoma State University. Additionally, Masters students from Sonoma State University will travel to Stockholm University to receive training in genomics and bioinformatics. International activities and travel will be supported by funds from the International Science and Engineering section of NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities."
0.319999,"The focus of this research program is the atomic-scale structure and dynamics of the silicate minerals, glasses and magmas that are at the center of most geological processes, from those taking place at the Earth's surface to those in the planet's deep interior. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide better fundamental understanding, and eventually better prediction, of the material properties that ultimately control complex processes in nature, many of which have enormous impacts on people and on society. For the two-year grant period, one emphasis will be on the effects of high pressure on the structure and properties of silicate melts that represent magmas in the Earth, and hence are tied to many geological processes including the formation and eruption of volcanoes. A second major activity will be further development and application of methods to measure the distribution of minor elements in some of the most important silicate minerals in the Earth's crust and mantle, in order to improve models that describe their chemical behavior in nature, and thus better our ability to glean clues about geological evolution from natural samples. Results and methods developed in this project should continue to be of major interest outside of the Earth sciences, particularly for researchers working to develop and optimize silicate glasses and ceramics for advanced technologies, such as materials for data processing and transmission, computer displays, substrates for photovoltaics, fuel cells, and many other applications. Education is central to this project, since most of the research will be part of the training of Ph.D. and undergraduate students on their ways to careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The approach taken in this research is to identify important problems where critical details of short- to intermediate-range structure are needed and can be elucidated by laboratory measurements, collect accurate data on synthetic or natural materials, and determine the consequences of the results for key chemical and physical parameters. The most important experimental approach that will be used is solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which can reveal quantitative details about the structure around many of the components common in minerals and magmas, such as silicon, aluminum, oxygen, phosphorus, and sodium. A variety of compositions of glasses (representing the high temperature molten materials in natural magma systems) and crystalline materials will be synthesized, and measurements made of how their structures change with composition, temperature and pressure. One particular emphasis will be to continue to extend the applicability of NMR, traditionally used to look at abundant constituents of non-magnetic materials, to minor and even trace components and to materials containing substantial amounts of magnetic components. These data should be particularly important in helping to develop more accurate, physically-based models of mineral and magma properties and behavior, which are especially important in the Earth sciences, as many processes take place in regimes of temperature, pressure, and time that are inaccessible to direct observation."
0.32,"CAREER Abstract:<br/>Low Temperature Microplasmas For Thermal Energy Conversion, Education, and Outreach<br/><br/>Thermionic energy conversion (TEC) is the direct conversion of heat to electricity by the thermal<br/>(thermionic) emission of electrons from a very hot surface. Though historically pursued primarily<br/>for electricity production from nuclear sources in space applications, it has the potential to be used<br/>terrestrially for waste heat, solar, or nuclear energy conversion. To meet this objective, however,<br/>TEC must be enhanced to operate more efficiently at lower temperatures than historically possible.<br/>Microplasma thermionic energy conversion occurs when a microplasma (ionized gas) is ignited<br/>between a thermionic diode with an electrode spacing ~1-20 micrometers. This mode of operation<br/>could enable operation in inert gases, at near atmospheric pressures, and at lower temperatures - all<br/>necessary features for practical terrestrial application. Understanding of the fundamental interaction<br/>between thermionic emission and microplasmas will be advanced by this research in order to pave<br/>the way for microplasma-TEC devices. First principles theory and simulations will be used to reveal<br/>the inter-dependence between a microplasma and thermionic emission, and experiments will be<br/>conducted to confirm the enhancement of thermionic emission by a microplasma necessary to realize<br/>improved energy conversion efficiency. Carbon-based electrodes, including diamond and carbon<br/>nanotubes, will be synthesized using a microplasma jet processing technique and used as electrodes<br/>in microplasma-TEC experiments. In addition to the efficacy of microplasma-TEC being established<br/>by this research, fundamental studies will also advance the basic understanding of plasma/electrode<br/>coupling, where there are persistent questions that affect a wide variety of technologies from highintensity<br/>discharge lamps to arc-based materials deposition.<br/><br/>Direct thermal-to-electrical energy conversion can be used to convert solar, nuclear, and waste heat<br/>to electricity, and energy conversion technologies will play an important role in creating a more<br/>energy efficient and independent nation. The discoveries made by this research will lay the<br/>foundation for practical, terrestrial TEC devices that could become an essential part of the energy<br/>economy, greatly impacting energy security in the United States. Further, undergraduate students<br/>from underrepresented minorities will be engaged in this research early in their careers, creating a<br/>more effective undergraduate research experience and increasing the number that achieve graduate<br/>science and engineering degrees. Using a service-learning approach, outreach to the local K-8 youth<br/>in the community will be led by these undergraduates including the creation of a plasma exhibit for a<br/>community-wide science festival and a targeted, interactive outreach program on environmental<br/>science for middle school students. These undergraduate students will be exposed to the fulfilling<br/>nature of outreach and also inspire a large number of K-8 youth toward science and engineering,<br/>creating a perpetuating educational cycle in which each generation fosters the inspiration,<br/>excitement, and development of the next generation."
0.168103,"This award supports the renewal of the physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of California, Davis. Each year, the REU program will provide ten or eleven students from around the United States an opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program. REU students work closely with a faculty mentor on a ten-week research project in a variety of physics subfields. The projects span the subfields of astrophysics, biophysics, complex systems, condensed matter, nuclear and particle physics. Examples include developing new photomultipliers for dark matter searches, analyzing spectroscopic data to learn about the molecules present in distant planet-forming regions, designing new proteins with useful energy storage properties, and exploring strongly correlated materials through nuclear magnetic resonance. <br/><br/>In addition to their specific research project, the students learn from their interactions with faculty, graduate students, and other REU students, and from field trips showing physics-related work in diverse settings -- students will visit facilities such as the McClellan Nuclear Research Center, Lick Observatory, and the Advanced Light Source. Former UC Davis REU students now working in the San Francisco Bay Area will also describe their career paths to current participants. At the end of the program, each participant gives a formal research presentation and presents a written project report that can lead to a peer reviewed publication. Taken as a whole, the REU activities teach skills useful for further scientific endeavors, give students a broad perspective on possible future paths, and help them build a network of professional contacts. The program especially targets students from small colleges with limited research opportunities and those from groups underrepresented in physics, including women and students from certain minority groups."

4.700001,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure how quarks are distributed in nucleons and in particular how the magnetic moments of quarks are aligned compared with the nucleon?s overall magnetic moment. Measurements over the past decade have shown that the quarks contribute only about 1/3 of the total spin of the nucleon, which gives rise to prediction that a significant fraction comes from the orbital motion of the quarks and other sources. The goal of these experiments is to compare results on the quark distributions (and their orbital motion) with theoretical predictions from the so-called Standard Model of Particle Physics. Additional measurements to search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron, which would be a signal of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the universe, are also part of this project. These research efforts will contribute to the education of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates in a broad array of skills needed in the advanced high tech workforce.<br/><br/>The prevailing theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD, is a generalization of the highly successful QED, yet QCD is hard pressed to provide either quantitative or intuitive descriptions of nucleon structure. This project will focus on investigating key properties of the proton, targeting the poorly measured sea quarks and the unknown orbital motion of the quarks. The research will be performed at four experiments: SeaQuest at Fermilab, PHENIX at Brookhaven, and COMPASS-II and ATLAS at CERN. The strong force also played a role at the beginning of time. In the early stages of the big bang, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) existed for an instant, before the strong force confined the quarks into bound states. This fleeting state of matter has been recreated in the laboratory and found to possess extraordinary properties, such as a viscosity so low that it may be at its theoretical minimum. This grant enables continued study of the QGP?s properties using fully reconstructed jets at ATLAS and correlations in small collision systems at PHENIX. This award also supports a search for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron, a CP-violating quantity. The nEDM experiment aims at a 100-fold improvement over the present upper limit of the EDM set by previous experiments."

The PIs will focus on recruiting woman and Native American students.<br/><br/>The proposed effort will use novel NMR imaging experiments to measure velocity and temperature profiles in multiphase porous media systems, including micro-encapsulated PCMs (phase change materials). The approach is novel and offers the potential to extend the capabilities of NMR applied to the fundamental study of thermo-fluid systems. The high spatial resolution of NMR is first calibrated with well know PCM materials and will provide data to study and quantify transport at the micro-scale (pore size) in porous media systems. The work will also incorporate CFD modeling and analysis that captures the complexity of the experiment that will produce new information to allow for a finer level of examination of the models used to relate micro-scale physical processes to macro-scale heat transfer."

0.379711,"Modeling the flow of groundwater is fundamental for understanding the quantity of water available for human use, and the movement of chemicals, such as carbon, underground, into streams, and into the atmosphere. Accurate groundwater models require an understanding of the properties of soils and rocks that affect the flow of water (i.e. the permeability). Permeability is traditionally measured directly by inducing groundwater flow using pumping, slug, or packer tests; however, these methods can be limited by small measurement volumes and require the existence of wells. Indirect estimates of permeability based on geophysical techniques benefit from relatively short measurement times, do not require fluid extraction, and are non-invasive when made from the surface (or minimally invasive when made in a borehole). However, estimates of permeability based on a single geophysical method often require calibration for rock type, and cannot be used to determine all of the physical properties required to accurately determine permeability. This research focuses on developing an innovative method for estimating permeability based on the synergistic coupling of two complementary geophysical methods - complex resistivity (CR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) - aimed at providing a robust and minimally-invasive determination of permeability at the watershed scale.<br/><br/>The proposed research will use a combination of mechanistic model development, laboratory measurements, and field measurements to develop a permeability model based on CR and NMR parameters. The model and measurements will be tested at the Christina River Basin, an NSF funded Critical Zone Observatory (CRB-CZO), in which the accuracy of groundwater models has been limited by complex spatial variation in subsurface permeability. This research represents a critical step towards the development of joint NMR/CR measurements to obtain spatially dense information about permeability that will improve the quantitative characterization of groundwater flow."

1.169916,"Purification is a normal requirement for determining the structure of biological macromolecules. However, these structures may differ depending on whether the macromolecule is in the cell interacting with its partner, or purified from cellular components. Thus, the physiological relevance of many structures remains unknown. This project will develop new experiments to characterize biological molecules in purified form, in living cells and even in whole organisms. The technique to be used, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides information about both the structure and dynamics. An important challenge for these experiments is that they often require large amounts of material, and, therefore, the studies are often limited to simple macromolecules studied in their purified forms, rather than in a native biological context. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful technique for enhancing NMR sensitivity. This project will develop DNP experiments that capture signals from amounts of material typically found in living cells. Knowledge of structures of biological macromolecules benefits society because it enables detailed understanding of basic biological processes. The proposed activities will also benefit society through training of new scientists and outreach activities.<br/><br/>The project will use dynamic nuclear polarization to study full viral particles of the bacteriophage Pf1, which is both an important biological agent and a template for nanotechnology. The knowledge gained regarding the virus structure, molecular recognition, solvation, and dynamics, will contribute to a broader understanding of self-assembly. The project will also develop improvements in DNP technology. DNP operates by transferring signal strength from the unpaired electrons of stable free radicals to nuclei that are then detected in the NMR experiments. These compounds, containing two closely spaced stable free radicals, are mixed with the sample. To better deliver the radical compounds, the project will develop ways to attach them to proteins in ways that facilitate specific enhancements. Moreover, tagging the proteins will facilitate detailed studies to better understand the mechanism of polarization transfer."
0.15,"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop an optofluidic platform for applications in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that require enhanced detection sensitivity. In the US, NMR accounts for the largest share of the molecular spectroscopy market, with an estimated value of $700 million in 2013 and $1 billion in 2018. The compact, portable system that will result from this work will find applications in existing, emerging, or new markets connected to areas spanning point-of-care diagnostics, bio-defense, environmental monitoring, and food safety. This technology will also bring new opportunities to analytical science, particularly in studies that demand the high-throughput characterization of varied chemical moieties, as routinely carried out in the pharmaceutical industry. Further, this work will positively impact efforts to improve healthcare facilities through the development of advanced and low-cost diagnostic tools. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to circumvent multiple limitations of existing nuclear spin polarization technologies through a robust, low-cost platform that leverages recent experimental findings. The technology to be developed introduces a new, laser-assisted route to enhancing the fractional alignment of nuclear spins in a target fluid, thus reducing the analyte's volume, the acquisition time, and the cost and size of the overall NMR system. The proposed approach articulates fluidics and photonic technologies to dynamically polarize fluids exposed to a properly engineered solid-state matrix. A central goal is to engineer the proposed device and conduct initial characterizations of its performance using model target fluids; the anticipated level of polarization is of the order 0.1% to 1% (i.e., orders of magnitude superior than that possible with commercially available magnets). These 'hyperpolarized' fluids can be used directly for inspection, or as a resource to post-polarize other (e.g., light-sensitive) fluidic systems."
16.85,"The primary theme of the JILA PFC is to address the challenge of bridging the gap from few-body physics to many-body physics through quantum control. The central scientific objective is to extend the remarkable level of control and understanding that physicists have for few-body systems to many-body quantum systems. Quantum systems made up of many particles and their interactions play an essential role in much of physics, including condensed matter physics, material physics, nuclear physics, high-energy particle physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and chemical physics. The JILA PFC will focus upon the challenge of controlling and understanding multi-particle quantum systems using the tools and ideas of atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, which, ironically, is a field of physics for which many-body physics has not traditionally been emphasized. AMO physics is in the midst of a revolution, evidenced, for example, by the remarkable accomplishments in recent years of experiments on ultracold gases, ultrafast laser technology, and ultraprecise spectroscopy. This revolution affords a new approach for confronting the behavior of complex multi-particle systems using control at the quantum level. <br/><br/>In the period 2011- 2016, the JILA PFC investigators will apply the tools of modern AMO physics to tackle the challenge of bridging the gap from few-body to many-body quantum physics from both sides, using cutting-edge techniques to study few-body problems beyond current understanding and many-particle ensembles in regimes beyond the limits of a mean-field description. Specific questions to be addressed are (1) What new insights can one bring to quantum many-body physics using ultracold atom and molecule gases as model systems? (2) Can one extend AMO's measurement and control techniques to create new types of many-body systems using coherent light-matter coupling? (3) Can one understand and address, in the few- to many-body problem, the physics of molecule formation and, more generally, chemical reactions by applying cutting-edge technologies to control and probe simple molecular systems? (4) What are potential high impact research directions that are closely tied to this work? The research will take place at JILA, a multidisciplinary research institute located on the University of Colorado campus in Boulder, and builds upon the extensive results achieved under the present PFC funding. Significant results in nanokelvin molecular physics, in non-classical behavior of nano-oscillators and microwave fields, and in various probes of solid and liquid dynamics across timescales that span twelve orders of magnitude, all set the stage for rapid future progress in four major activities:.<br/><br/>Major Activity 1: Building complex matter from the ground up.<br/><br/>Work in this area will explore the rich phenomena arising in novel quantum many-body systems that are assembled from ultracold atoms and molecules. This major activity, which has strong connections to condensed matter physics, will include research in dipolar molecular quantum gases and strongly interacting atomic quantum gases. Specific research goals include exploring the boundary between gaseous and liquid behavior in gases of strongly interacting particles, and realizing novel states of quantum matter using the long-range and anisotropic interactions between ultracold polar molecules.<br/><br/>Major Activity 2: Engineering quantum many-body systems using light-matter coupling.<br/><br/>This activity will extend quantum control to increasingly complex systems by exploiting coherent light matter interactions. Projects will explore collective light emission from cold atoms, the quantum motion of nano-mechanical oscillators, and light-induced coherence in material systems. An example project is an ambitious effort to map non-classical photon states in the microwave onto corresponding states in optical modes and vice versa, using a nanomechanical ""diving board"" as the coupling medium.<br/><br/>Major Activity 3: Confronting molecular transformation.<br/><br/>At the most basic level, reactions proceed via the interaction between electrons and the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion. JILA PFC investigators will explore the physics of reactions at this fundamental level, with the goal of understanding, and learning to control, energy flow in small systems such as triatomic and tetratomic molecules. They will focus on three projects: studying cold and ultracold reactive molecular scattering, probing time-resolved nuclear and electronic dynamics, and developing coherent UV to IR molecular spectroscopy.<br/><br/>Major Activity 4: Exploring high impact synergistic research directions.<br/><br/>An essential aspect of JILA's center philosophy is that one should be alert to opportunities to ""export"" interesting ideas and technologies to activities outside the central focus of the center, and to import these as well. JILA will explore a few of these opportunities, investing a small fraction of center resources in facilitating this trade in ideas and technology.<br/><br/>The major activities share a common focus, and therefore have substantial intellectual and scientific overlap, and, if, anything, still stronger technological overlap. Prior experience has shown that the extraordinarily challenging goals envisioned for the JILA PFC are best tackled with fluid collaborations that can draw on a range of capabilities, such as laser frequency combs, ultracold atoms, advanced VUV sources, quantum and ultrafast optics, the sensitive detection methods of chemical physics, and theoretical methods, both computational and analytic. This diversity of expertise cannot readily be synthesized in an individual investigator's group. In addition, the JILA PFC relies on and continuously upgrades a shared technical infrastructure including a world-class machine shop, as well as electronics and computational support, and engages in a collective program of education and outreach efforts.<br/><br/>The JILA program will have many different broader impacts. It will enhance the nation's technical infrastructure by developing many new laser-based tools and techniques, and by producing many graduates who are highly trained not only in AMO physics but also in technical communication and teaching skills. It will connect with the science community around the world and foster field-wide frontier research through organization and hosting of topical workshops, through a short-term and long-term JILA visitor program, as well as through the many undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who participate in the collaborative and interdisciplinary research at JILA. As discussed above, the proposed work connects to many different areas of physics, including applied areas such as materials physics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. Extending understanding and quantum control from few- to many-body systems will certainly impact many applications, such as photosynthesis, design of catalytic materials, and new techniques in renewable energy. The proposed program will also attract more students into science, particularly from under-represented groups, through a vigorous undergraduate research program and a predominantly minority-serving middle-school after-school enrichment program. It will contribute to general science interest and literacy through a variety of programs that include the very popular ""Wizards"" show for school children, the University of Colorado Saturday Physics public talks, and suitably trained graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who present science topics to Colorado middle-school and high-school students. It will also research, develop, and broadly disseminate better ways to teach AMO science to all students, better ways to teach AMO science to all students, particularly through on-line interactive simulation."
0.39502,"With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A Program (CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Christian B. Hilty of Texas A&M University in a project that will use magnetic resonance techniques to examine the structures of proteins in solution. These investigations will allow a determination of the way solvents such as water affect the shape and functions of the proteins they interact with. Since proteins play crucial roles in life processes and often carry out their functions in water solutions, these studies will impact research in molecular biology and the biomedical sciences. The investigator will also develop a series of web-based modules, aimed at middle school to high school students, which will highlight the importance of molecular structure in chemistry and biology.<br/><br/>The proposed research will employ nuclear hyperpolarization based NMR techniques to investigate site specific and time dependent solvent-protein interactions. NMR spectra acquired after mixing the protein with hyperpolarized solvent will reveal polarization transferred to sites on the protein. The distribution of polarization on the protein will be used to derive solvent binding sites, contact areas and protein structure."
0.92146,"Intellectual merit. Nanoscale molecular machines found in a cell exceed any human creations in their intricacy and vastly exceed anything humans have created for efficiency. These are responsible for cellular functions that range from transporting objects across membranes to machines that synthesize, to motors that move cargo from one location to another. For a few of the smaller machines we have been able to merge our studies on the structure of these machines, with our observations on what the machine is doing and, as result, provide insight to how the machine works. Alas, our ability to analyze, and therefore understand, the larger, more sophistical biological machines. This project develops the computational tools to test how these machines work. The first model to be studied is the pore that regulates transport in and out of the nucleus across the nuclear envelope, the central part of the cell that guards our genome. Preliminary studies demonstrate that advances in computation can allow us to understand how these machines function at a molecular level with such great efficiency and speed. <br/><br/>Broader impacts. These results have impacts on several important levels. First, understanding the basic operation of the pores that guard the nucleus is an essential goal of cell biology. Which genes are turned on and off often depends upon which molecules are allowed to enter through these pores that surround the nucleus. Second, we need to fully understand how malfunctions of these pores can affect the normal state and integrity of the cell. Third, practical application of the engineering design principles used by cellular machines at a nanoscale can have tremendous economic and technological potential when applied and scaled to other problems. Nature has created nanomachines that vastly exceed in efficiency anything humans have created. Understanding how these nanomachines work can provide insights into our own technology. Fourth, this work makes science research accessible to a much broader community. The investigators have been working in the New York public school system for 35 years. Current involvement includes integrating high school teachers and their students in the laboratory over the summer, participating as a board member of the education committee of the New York Academy of Sciences, running monthly meetings for New York regional science teachers, as well as placing graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in middle and high schools in the New York area. Even though most high school students do not have access to high-end experimental tools, work such as this can be done on a home personal computer, thus making this science accessible to a broad population, which might not otherwise have the chance to pursue scientific research."
0.44079,"With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Tadeusz Malinski from Ohio University and colleagues Eric Masson, Stephen Bergmeier, Michael Jensen and Jennifer Hines will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (11.7 Tesla magnet, 54 mm bore, with active shielding.) The new spectrometer would have gradient shimming, 4-radiofrequency channel, a variable temperature unit, and three probes: an inverse triple resonance microprobe for the observation of 1H while decoupling 13C and 15N nuclei and a multinuclear broadband Fluorine Observe SmartProbe. The project is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) study of highly complex macromolecules from natural products and from synthetic preparations; (b) synthesis of medicinally relevant natural and unnatural products; (c) study of recognition properties and applications of the Cucurbituril family of macrocycles using supramolecular chemistry; (d) identification of highly substituted polypyridine-metal complexes that have a large number of overlapping aromatic protons in spectra collected at lower field strength; (e) use of paramagnetic NMR techniques; (f) development of RNA-targeted ligands; and (g) nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathways.<br/><br/>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.

The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and will impact a large number of students including some from the Appalachian Ohio region and also industrial partnerships.

0.019309,"In the last decade, scientific exploration of Madagascar's remarkable biodiversity and its origin has shifted to characterizing the drivers of evolution within the island. This project will use two endemic lineages of the myrrh tree genus (50 spp., Commiphora, Burseraceae) as models to test hypotheses regarding the influence of geography on species diversification in the seasonally dry tropical forests of western Madagascar. These hypotheses predict that species have arisen as a consequence of isolation caused by 1) watershed expansion and contraction, 2) river barriers, and 3) historical climate change. A subset of 959 nuclear genes will be sampled from all endemic species using a cost-effective high-throughput method that combines microfluidic amplification and massively-parallel sequencing. The resulting data will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these species and will be combined with specimen-based mapping to test the overarching biogeographical hypotheses. <br/><br/>Genomic markers developed as part of this research will also be evaluated for their transferability to other species across the angiosperm tree of life, which may expand the methodological toolkit for all plant systematists. This research will provide mentorship opportunities for two undergraduate students and will support their professional development, including presentation of their research at a national meeting. Additional outreach will be provided to involve K-12 and undergraduate students through ongoing mentorship activities."
0.156,"Dark matter and neutrino properties are among the most compelling problems to be studied in modern physics. Dark matter particles may be detected through the observation of nuclear recoils produced when they scatter with nuclei in a target. Nuclear recoils can also be created when neutrinos coherently scatter with nuclei. This process, if ever observed, would help in probing non-standard neutrino interactions, searching for sterile neutrinos, and understanding the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. Both scattering rates increase dramatically as the energies of nuclear recoils go down. The lower the energy threshold of a detector, the more events can be detected. <br/><br/>Recent activity in the SURF underground laboratory stimulated support from the South Dakota state to the expansion of PhD programs at state universities. The activity planned with this award provides an opportunity for a PhD student to take part in research related to underground science. The activity may also pave the way for practical applications of undoped NaI/CsI at 77 K in civil uses. For example, un-doped NaI at 77 K has a much faster scintillation signal than NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. It can be used to improve the time and position resolution of PET, resulting in more precise imaging of the concerned tissue of a patient.<br/><br/>A straight forward way to lower the energy threshold of a scintillation detector is to increase its light yield. This award is focused on optimizing the light readout from un-doped NaI/CsI at 77 K. Both sodium iodide and cesium iodide doped with thallium, NaI/CsI(Tl), are excellent scintillators at room temperature. The PI plans to couple un-doped NaI/CsI directly to the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), cool them down to 77 K to maximize the light readout. Low temperature properties of the PMTs will be compared; dimensions and various surface treatments of un-doped NaI/CsI crystals will be examined to optimize the light collection efficiency. The goal is to verify whether it is possible to lower the energy threshold by a factor of two by increasing the light yield by a factor of two, compared to existing experiments utilizing NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. The decay times of scintillation light from un-doped NaI/CsI at 77 K are quite different from those of NaI/CsI(Tl) at room temperature. Their effect on signal and background discrimination will also be examined."
0.271319,"Neutron stars are the densest objects in the Universe and have fascinated theorists and observers since they were first conjectured. Despite a wealth of observations across the electromagnetic spectrum over the last four decades, much of what happens in their deep interior remains inscrutable. Owing to X-ray telescopes such as Chandra, laboratory nuclear experiments, and perhaps in the near future gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), knowledge of neutron star physics is growing rapidly. Indeed, the National Academy report, ""Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century"" identified the nature of matter at exceedingly high density and temperature as one of the eleven critical science questions for the twenty-first century. Moreover, the recent 2010 Decadal Survey ""New Worlds, New Horizons"" identifies as one of its Frontier questions for Stars and Stellar Evolution, ""What controls the mass, radius, and spin of compact stellar remnants?"" The models developed in this project will enable existing and future observations to further our knowledge of the physics of dense matter and stellar evolution.<br/><br/>This project includes activities to recruit the next generation of scientists and to inform the public and provides support of a graduate student for three years. The project supports an undergraduate to assist with running the codes used in the project, and to assist with testing, maintaining, and posting educational resources using the open-source MESA stellar evolution code. The PI with assistance from the undergraduate will develop problem sets, plots, and animations using MESA. Michigan State is a large public institution with a diverse student population and will serve as a testbed for development of these resources. In particular, the PI will develop problem ""templates"" so that students can more readily use MESA to explore stellar physics. These tools will be posted on the MESA web forum http://mesastar.org/. Posting these tools will make it easier for other instructors to adopt MESA for classroom instruction and is expected to motivate others to post their results as well. For public outreach, the PI will incorporate discoveries made during the tenure of this award into public talks at Michigan State's Abrams Planetarium.<br/><br/>More technically, for neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, in which the neutron star accretes hydrogen- or helium-rich material, there is a wealth of time-dependent phenomena spanning a wide range of timescales. During accretion, runaway thermonuclear burning of the accreted matter is observable as a Type I X-ray burst. The thousands of observed X-ray bursts, the rarer and more energetic superbursts, and the cooling transients all encode information about the physics of dense matter, in particular the sub-nuclear-density ""crust"" of the neutron star. For over a decade the model of the neutron star's crust has been that the three layers influence each other: the short bursts produce the fuel for superbursts, superburst ashes form the outer crust, and nuclear reactions in the crust heat the envelope. In the last several years, however, evidence has steadily mounted that this picture is at best incomplete, and that additional, strong, shallow---and as yet unidentified---heat sources are present. This project will generate global models of the neutron star crust with the latest nuclear reaction physics, including a newly discovered neutrino cooling mechanism, and use existing and future observations of cooling transients, superbursts, and X-ray bursts to constrain the depth and strength of additional heating in the crust. In addition, they will make predictions for the uniqueness of the crust composition as a function of density, which is important for determining the neutron star's thermal and magnetic evolution as well as its ability to sustain a mass quadrupole."
0.28,"As engineered systems grow in complexity, the difficulty of safe and reliable operation of these systems becomes more challenging. For example, consider the $15 billion international nuclear fusion reactor being built in Cadarache, France. Although the world has known for 60 years that it is possible to produce energy from nuclear fusion by heating plasma in a magnetic field, physicists have never been able to control the magnetic field accurately enough to produce significant amounts of power. The reason is that even the simplest models of magneto hydrodynamics involve more than 20 coupled nonlinear differential equations. Although algorithms for control have made great strides in recent years, control of systems of this complexity is still out of reach. This project will design new algorithms for control which use supercomputers and massively parallel computation in an attempt to enable the safe and reliable design of controllers for large complex systems such as describe plasma in a reactor.<br/><br/>At the heart of the project is a new way of using convex optimization to parameterize Lyapunov functions (a measure of energy). Specifically, while the well-known sum-of-squares parameterization of positive polynomials is convex, reliable and accurate for small-scale systems, it cannot be readily adapted to supercomputers and other forms of massively parallel computation. The essence of this project, then is to look for alternative mathematical parameterizations of Lyapunov functions which are convex and furthermore are amenable to parallel computation. Such alternatives exist in classical mathematical results by Handelman, Polya and Bernstein. The scope of work is to use those results to create parallel codes, which can study multiple coupled nonlinear equations and determine the best possible Lyapunov function fit within the mathematical Language of polynomials. The project will test these algorithms on cluster and parallel graphics processor computing machines and will be able to study nonlinear differential equations with up to 20 states. These algorithms will then be applied to discretized nonlinear partial differential equation representations of the magneto-hydrodynamics of plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor to obtain a function of energy which can then be used to design and test magnetic and radio frequency controllers which will reduce or eliminate magneto hydrodynamic instabilities. The algorithms developed can also be applied to any large nonlinear system, implying they can be used to improve understanding and control in applications such as chemical reactors, gene regulatory networks and communication satellites."
0.194405,"This research concerns three broad projects, each with several subproblems of varying difficulty. The first project aims to prove the equivalence of three regularity properties for separable simple nuclear C*-algebras: one topological, one homological, and one algebraic. The proof of this fact, which has recently seen rapid progress toward a solution under some restrictions on traces, would represent a deep generalization of Kirchberg's characterization of purely infinite simple nuclear C*-algebras. The second project concerns the interplay between descriptive set theory and C*-algebras, and specifically the use of the notion of Borel reducibility to answer, for various classes of functional analytic objects, the question: How complicated is isomorphism? The objects that the principal investigator will consider include nuclear, exact, and locally reflexive C*-algebras, and operator spaces and systems. The third project examines uniform perturbations of C*-algebras and the degree to which they preserve structure and invariants. Important questions here include whether or not Z-stability and stability are preserved by such perturbations.<br/><br/>Many fields of scientific inquiry require analyzing infinite-dimensional systems and the ways in which they can be transformed. Examples include models for quantum physics, signal analysis, and weather patterns. Infinite-dimensional systems are, of course, complicated. Understanding them often proceeds by approximating them with simpler finite-dimensional systems. This project uses this approach in an effort to understand infinite-dimensional systems called C*-algebras. The finite-dimensional approximating objects are square arrays with complex number entries. Our aim is to identify conditions under which one can approximate the infinite-dimensional system arbitrarily closely using only a fixed finite number of overlapping arrays. This last property is known to have powerful consequences for the original system, consequences that reveal a great deal of detail about its structure."
0.4,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Bowers and Hagelin-Weaver and their groups at the University of Florida will combine state-of-the-art catalyst synthesis, characterization, and reaction studies to identify and mitigate the processes that reduce pairwise hydrogenation during Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP). PHIP is a robust and inexpensive method used for sensitivity enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. In addition to potential biomedical utilization, PHIP is a powerful method for the study of hydrogenation catalysis and new insights gained during this proposed research may well have a major impact on the field of catalytic reactions, beyond hydrogenation. Students will receive interdisciplinary training in catalysis, reactor design, materials characterization, and surface chemistry. The PIs also propose to reach out to teachers from rural and urban schools serving 50% or more students from socio-economically underserved homes by coordinating with UF's CPET programs for teacher recruitment. The proposed outreach efforts will provide an innovative and productive linkage between cutting-edge research and secondary school STEM education.<br/><br/>The proposed research seeks to identify correlations between catalyst properties, activity and pairwise selectivity. The proposed research plan will be the first to combine state-of-the art nanoparticle fabrication strategies with precision atomic layer deposition (ALD). Interpretation of PHIP data will be guided by spin density matrix theory. Development of unique PHIP NMR instrumentation is another key element of the project. Pairwise selectivities obtained with oxides and oxide supported metal particles are currently limited to a few percent. Attaining substantially higher pairwise selectivity using engineered oxide-supported metal nanoparticle catalysts would be a transformative outcome of the project. This low pairwise selectivity problem will be addressed through fundamental kinetic and mechanistic studies. The proposed studies also aim to broaden the variety of targets that can be hyperpolarized by this class of catalyst."

0.22,"The primary thread of research will focus on emerging analogies between the structure of II_1 factors and simple C*-algebras. For example, there are now C*-analogues of McDuff's Theorem and Connes's ""Injective implies McDuff"" result (which played a fundamental role in classifying injective factors). The investigator hopes to explore these analogies with the ultimate goal of classifying simple C*-algebras of so-called finite nuclear dimension. In another direction, the investigator will continue working on C*-algebras associated to groups and related spaces that were recently introduced in joint work with Erik Guentner. Finally, we will continue our study of dynamical systems associated to II_1 factors which arise from certain homomorphisms.<br/><br/>One very successful idea in mathematics is that we can learn about complicated objects by approximating with simpler objects, then passing to a limit. For example, in calculus we compute the area under a curve using rectangular approximations, then refining the approximations over and over. Operator algebras are (usually) infinite dimensional objects which provide the natural framework for quantum mechanics, for example. Moreover, deep and unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology and probability were discovered over the years. As such, a solid understanding of the structure of operator algebras is important. The general philosophy of using approximations by simpler objects becomes especially relevant here since the objects of interest are infinite dimensional. The investigator will continue an established tradition of trying to use finite dimensional approximations to better understand some fundamental infinite dimensional objects."

0.706,"The establishment of proper neuron connections during development is essential for coordinated behavior. Axons, the wires of the nervous system, are guided to their targets by attractive and repulsive cues. This project will investigate the mechanisms that promote axon attraction to the midline of the fly central nervous system. Similar to the vertebrate floor plate, the fly midline is an intermediate target for navigating axons, which must decide whether or not to cross the midline. Netrin attracts axons to the midline through receptors of the Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (DCC) family (frazzled in Drosophila). However, it is unclear how Frazzled/DCC signaling mediates axon attraction and what additional mechanisms contribute to midline circuit assembly. Defining these mechanisms will enrich understanding of how guidance molecules work in the intact animal and have the potential to suggest therapeutic targets for disorders of the nervous system. The project includes outreach activities that are aimed at increasing high school scientific literacy and aptitude. Each summer, a high school teacher will spend six weeks in the laboratory, where he/she will collaborate with lab personnel to conduct original research and design a teaching module to bring back to the classroom. <br/><br/>To define mechanisms mediating axon attraction, this proposal seeks 1) to identify genes that act with Fra to control midline guidance, 2) to determine how the novel role of Fra in activating gene transcription is regulated by receptor proteolysis, and 3) to test if nuclear localization and transcriptional activation function of the Fra intracellular domain (ICD) are required for Fra-dependent gene expression. A sensitized genetic screen will identify new components that act with Fra to promote midline crossing, and molecular genetic approaches will be used to investigate a novel role for Semaphorin1a (identified in our screen) during midline guidance. Molecular and genetic approaches will be used to test the importance of proteolysis of the Fra receptor. Candidate genes from the screen will be tested for roles in Fra-dependent transcription. In vitro assays in insect and yeast cells will be used to delimit sequences that are necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization, nuclear export, and transactivation function of the Fra ICD. Finally, in vivo requirements for these elements will be tested by generating mutated forms of the Fra receptor, expressing them as transgenes, and assaying their ability to promote midline axon attraction and target gene expression."
0.288153,"As the Earth's climate becomes warmer and more variable, characteristics that help organisms cope with stress will become increasingly important. This research investigates beetles living at high elevation in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California to study how variation in genes coding for proteins that process energy and respond to stress affect metabolism and performance. The research seeks to discover the contrasting roles of oxygen, which is necessary to process metabolic fuel, and temperature, which changes the rate at which these processes occur. It is a synthesis of genomics, physiology, and animal natural history that will provide a unique opportunity to understand how organisms cope with environmental change. It will provide insight into the evolution of thermal plasticity and may unveil novel genes associated with temperature and oxygen stress. The work will increase research opportunities for students at two primarily undergraduate universities. Students will be trained in experimental design and analysis, proposal and paper writing, and in the presentation of research at scientific meetings, which will provide them with marketable skills for the modern work environment. Educational materials will be developed for K12 education, which illustrate the use of genomic tools for answering scientific questions. Outreach events detailing the results of this project will occur at public events in the San Francisco Bay Area and near field sites in Inyo County, California.<br/><br/>This project will develop and use genomic and transcriptomic tools to gain mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of adaptation to temperature and atmospheric oxygen in the Sierra willow leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis. This research will test the hypothesis that interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have pervasive effects on gene expression that scale up to differences in metabolic capacity and performance. To test this hypothesis, the stress response will be investigated in larvae from populations that differ with respect to mitochondrial and nuclear genetic background and that occur along a latitudinal and steep altitudinal temperature gradients. Larvae will be reared at a high elevation laboratory in chambers where oxygen level and temperature will be manipulated. At the end of the growth period, larvae reared under these different conditions will be exposed to different temperatures and running speed measured. Genetic variation associated with fast and slow running speed after stress will be identified using whole genome sequencing of individuals in the upper and lower tails of the running speed distribution. Differences in expression of genes of interest will be assessed using RNA sequencing for these same individuals. Genes of interest (e.g. stress, hypoxia, central metabolism) that have non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation along natural temperature or elevation gradients will be identified in whole genome sequencing experiments and used to build 'SNP panels' in which larger numbers of individuals can be screened. Rearing conditions described above will then be used to generate larvae in which metabolic physiology will be examined. Metabolic enzyme activity, mitochondrial respiration, oxidative damage and thermal tolerance will be measured, SNP variation recorded, and differential expression of genes of interest quantified using quantitative PCR. Taken together, this research will reveal how mitochondrial and nuclear genomes interact to cope with stress in a changing environment. The project will establish a new international collaboration with world leading experts in insect genomics from Stockholm University (Sweden). International collaborators will help organize and lead a two-week hands-on workshop on genomics and bioinformatics for undergraduate and Masters students from Santa Clara University and Sonoma State University. Additionally, Masters students from Sonoma State University will travel to Stockholm University to receive training in genomics and bioinformatics. International activities and travel will be supported by funds from the International Science and Engineering section of NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities."
0.152916,"There has been much interest in the physics literature in the study of mathematical models involving matrices of large size. This work began with the pioneering results Eugene Wigner in the 1950's, in which the energy levels of certain models in nuclear physics were modeled as the ""eigenvalues"" of large random matrices. The beautiful result of Wigner is that the energy levels actually become nonrandom in the limit as the size of the matrices goes to infinity and are described by Wigner's famous semicircular distribution. This result was the first indication that certain complicated calculations actually become simpler as the size of the matrices involved gets larger. This mathematics research project by Brian Hall is in the same spirit. Hall and his collaborator T. Kemp study an important tool in quantum mechanics (the ""Segal--Bargmann transform"") on groups of matrices. Their first results indicate that the transform does indeed simplify substantially in the limit as the size of the matrices goes to infinity, to the point that the calculations can be carried out efficiently on a computer. There are many beautiful results still to investigate, including the problem of determining the appropriate analog of Wigner's semicircular law in this setting. This work has close connections to the two-dimensional version of strong nuclear force. That subject, in turn, has been connected to string theory by the Nobel Prize winner David Gross, since the ""worldsheet"" swept out by a string is a two-dimensional surface.<br/><br/><br/> This mathematics research project by Brian Hall concerns the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory describing the behavior of matter at the atomic scale. Quantum mechanics is foundational to many areas of science and engineering, including solid state physics and the design of computer chips. Ideas from quantum mechanics also have had a profound impact in mathematics, as exemplified by the awarding of the Fields Prize (the so-called Nobel Prize for mathematics) to a physicist, Ed Witten, in 1990. A key issue in quantum mechanics concerns its connection with classical mechanics, the theory that governs the behavior of matter on the macroscopic scale. The Segal--Bargmann transform is a mathematical tool that facilitates a comparison between classical and quantum mechanics. Hall's earlier work has extended the range of application of the Segal--Bargmann transform, and has been cited extensively in both the physics and mathematics literature. Hall's ongoing research will expand the scope of the transform still farther, by connecting it to models derived from study of the strong nuclear force and string theory. This work has potential applications in both mathematics itself, with connections to the exciting new field of free probability theory, and in physics, with possible connections to both string theory and loop quantum gravity."
0.463682,"This project will survey and document the biodiversity of amphibian, reptile, bird and small mammal faunas in Nuclear Central America, defined as the region between the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico and the Nicaraguan depression.

The continuing recent reports of many new species from the region demonstrates that much of the diversity of the region remains to be described. Unfortunately, this part of Central America has suffered extensive deforestation. This research project aims to generate extensive data on species distributions and diversity that can be used both to test evolutionary hypotheses and to guide conservation actions for the region. <br/><br/>The project is a collaboration between the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, the Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico, the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala, the Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School in Honduras, and the Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Nicaragua.

0.336008,"Among the key areas of study currently in particle physics are precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters, the neutrino mass hierarchy and measurement of CP violation in the neutrino sector. To address these requires a more detailed understanding, both experimentally and theoretically, of neutrino interactions in nuclear matter. With the emphasis long baseline experiments, in which matter effects are important, and on Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers as the detectors of choice for many experiments, where the relevant atomic number is A=40 for Argon, such understanding is not only necessary, but fundamental.<br/><br/>The research effort at Virginia Polytechnic and State University is aimed directly at these questions and is based on a complementary approach using experiment, theory and simulation. The objectives include: (1) to compare event generator predictions with experimental data, focusing on comparisons with measurements that the Virginia Tech group and collaborators will perform in Liquid Argon using the MicroBooNE detector; (2) to determine the impact of nuclear models, correlations and neutrino interaction uncertainties on the discovery of CP violation in the lepton sector and the experimental determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters; (3) to include state-of-the-art nuclear models in the neutrino interaction simulation and (4) to determine the level of detail needed in these models to achieve the required sensitivity to observe CP violation. The proposed research is potentially transformative, by altering and refining the scope of the GENIE neutrino event generator to predict events more precisely and interface it with the GLoBES simulator to understand the effect of neutrino interactions on the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters for past and future neutrino experiments worldwide.<br/><br/>In parallel with the research, the program includes important educational components, directed at high school and more advanced levels. The group will build upon an already active PhysTec program at Virginia Tech and will create a QuarkNet center to attract high school teachers and students, with initial emphasis on neutrino physics. The group also actively encourages the participation in the research of students from underrepresented groups through the Virginia-North Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation (VT-AMP) program."
0.285799,"1531313<br/>Parsekian <br/><br/>Funding from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will enable an early career investigator to acquire a wireline, borehole nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) well logging tool to be used for investigations of subsurface hydrologic properties. NMR spectroscopy is sensitive to Hydrogen nuclei and has long been used for hydrocarbon exploration. The proposed NMR instrument is designed to fit into standard groundwater wells and is tuned to pick up the resonant frequencies specific to Hydrogen nuclei. The borehole NMR instrument would become part of the Facility for Imaging of the Near & Subsurface Environment (FINSE), an established Instrument facility at UW managed by trained staff and would support the field analytical capabilities of the Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG), a center of excellence in hydro geophysics funded by NSF/EPSCoR. <br/><br/>The NMR well logging tool will offer greatly improved spatial ( < 0.5 m) and temporal resolution of subsurface hydrological parameters over conventional methods that typically aggregate subsurface hydrological observations over 10s of meters so the knowledge gained has the potential to be transformative and therefore supports NSF mission of promoting the progress of science.. The investigators intend to deploy the NMR tool for studies in vadose zone hydrology of interest to Critical Zone Observatories supported by NSF Division of Earth Sciences and studies of permafrost in the high Arctic; the instrument will be useful for groundwater resource assessment thus promoting the national welfare. The instrument will support hands on experiential learning by students using the NMR tool for studies of regional interest thereby fostering their future employability in fields that routinely engage in subsurface hydrologic studies, another aspect of the proposal that is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the national welfare.<br/><br/>***"
0.225,"This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will result in the fabrication and validation of an optically-detected magnetic resonance sensor for determining the chemical composition of trace quantities of liquid and powder samples. This is critical in numerous industries ranging from defense forensics and environmental safety, to materials synthesis and petroleum exploration. The desire for chemically-specific detection of trace analytes has spurred the growth of a large and diverse market, served by techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and high-field benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These are already sizeable markets (on the order of $1 billion) with annual growth rates of 5-10%, depending on product type and geography. This new sensor will have a direct and broad impact on public security and defense, for example in airport and border security checks. The reliable detection and analysis of small quantities of potentially-threatening chemicals and materials are essential for simultaneously meeting the increased demands for security and eliminating the need to test large quantities of analyte. An impact on science education is also anticipated, based on the anticipated development of an affordable turnkey system, which can be used in instructional and research settings.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the application of the basic physics of solid-state defects in diamond to create a device with unique properties desirable for chemical trace analysis. Unlike many NMR systems, this spectrometer operates at ambient temperature, in a range of magnetic fields easily generated by small permanent magnets, and with sub-microliter sample volumes. The analyte is delivered via a microfluidic chip to a sensor region consisting of a nanostructured diamond doped with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers. By applying pulses of laser light and microwaves, the magnetic field from the analyte's precessing nuclear magnetization becomes encoded in the NV fluorescence signal. Analysis of the fluorescence signal reveals the NMR spectrum of the analyte, from which the chemical composition can be extracted based on established libraries. This platform bypasses two common problems that hinder NMR sensitivity using traditional coil-based approaches. First, it does not rely on thermal polarization and thus allows operation at ambient temperature and low magnetic field without affecting the signal strength. Second, it uses a magnetometer to directly measure the nuclear magnetization and thus avoids the poor sensitivity that is fundamental to frequency-dependent flux detection."
0.225,"There is a wide range of beneficial and practical applications of accelerators and particle physics including medical diagnostic instrumentation, cancer therapy, monitoring of nuclear waste proliferation, computing, and many more. Optimizing an accelerator's operational parameters is a complex problem, yet critical to achieve robust performance and to increase the number of circulating particles. Computer models will be developed in this project to investigate the possible configurations, set specifications, and estimate the system performance. Algorithms will also be created to operate the accelerator as efficiently as possible, thus increasing the discovery potential in accelerator experiments. Student participation is an integral part of this project. The students will benefit from participating in cutting-edge research and having access to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. They will develop scientific programming and modeling skills, learn how to create and validate simulations, conduct measurements, and be involved with operations of complex accelerator systems. All of these experiences will be a realistic introduction to graduate work, and/or work in advanced industry in one of the many areas in which accelerators play a key role.<br/><br/>Innovative developments in a broad range of subfields of accelerator physics and technology will be required to achieve the beam specifications for the next generation accelerators. There are two major objectives in this project. First, a general model of the interaction between the next generation radio frequency (RF) system and the particle beam dynamics will be generated, which can be applied to future particle colliders and light sources. Second, this general model will be validated through application to a particular particle accelerator. The simulations of the next generation RF and low level radio frequency (LLRF) systems will be developed as block systems in the computer program Simulink. The simulation defining parameters and the initial conditions will be set in Matlab. Multi-particle simulations will also be developed in Python. The validation of models developed during this project will be done using the Large Hadron Collider crab cavity system, located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. The validation process will involve conducting proof of principle simulations, investigating the LLRF-beam dynamics interaction, studying the LLRF implementation, examining detrimental effects, and developing control algorithms; thus expanding the deliverables of this project. This project will have a significant impact on advancing knowledge in accelerator physics. The knowledge and expertise developed will be directly applicable to future particle colliders and light sources."
0.39,"The laws of nature can only be revealed through experimentation. A glaring deficiency in our understanding of those laws is the role played by time reversal symmetry violation, the connection between time and the physical forces. Because an electric dipole moment (EDM) can exist only if time-reversal symmetry is violated, the mercury EDM project will search for time reversal symmetry violation within the mercury atom. The size of the EDM will shed light on the correct description of the laws of nature. The signature of an EDM is a shift of the nuclear spin precession frequency (the signal used in MRI machines) when an electric field is applied to the atoms. The experiment will measure the effect of an electric field on the precession frequency to unprecedented accuracy and perhaps be the first experiment to detect a non-vanishing EDM.<br/><br/>The notion of time reversal symmetry and its violation appeals to the general public as well as a broad physics community. Within physics, EDM experiments are of interest to the atomic, nuclear, high energy, and astrophysics communities, both experimentalists and theorists alike. The mercury EDM project is a ""table-top"" experiment, giving graduate, undergraduate, and high school students the opportunity to work locally on a small-scale experiment in which they can explore fundamental issues normally studied only by large groups at high energy accelerators. These students gain experience in exquisite technology with atoms, lasers and electronics, and in turn help make advances in this technology that they take with them to their future careers. The techniques developed to measure nuclear spin precession frequencies to unprecedented accuracy are transferred to researchers in other fields where precision magnetometry is paramount."
0.1,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vadim Kaplunovsky at the University of Texas at Austin. His work focuses on several aspects of string theory -- which unifies gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature (strong, weak, and electromagnetic). String theory has an unusual property - it contains something called ""holographic dualities"", which relate theories in many-body quantum systems (ranging from quark-gluon plasma to superconductors) to theories of gravity in higher dimensional spaces. These dualities, since they relate to very different systems, allow calculations in one system to give results in the other. Professor Kaplunovsky studies the duality between forms of super-dense nuclear matter and models with crystal-like structures, as well as the duality between models of gravity in highly curved spaces with strongly interacting particle physics models. He also studies string theories which are dual to each other. All these projects are deeply connected to other aspects of string theory as well as to particle physics, nuclear physics, and condensed matter. To enhance the broader impact of his research, Professor Kaplunovsky will give a series of talks to high-school students about hot issues of modern physics (which alas are not even mentioned in a regular curriculum). The subjects may involve fundamental particles, cosmology, or anything else the students may be interested in. Prof. Kaplunovsky will also give a series of more advanced lectures about theoretical physics to the undergraduate students at the University of Texas and at other universities in the US and overseas.<br/><br/>Prof. Kaplunovsky's research focuses on several issues of string theory and holographic QCD. One project is about infinite crystals of YM instantons -- which 'live' in 4+1 dimensions (where they act as particles) but may form lower-dimensional lattices in external potentials. There are many types of such crystals, with different lattice geometries and/or different patterns of instantons' isospin orientations. The project focuses on surveying such crystals and the phase transitions between them, especially the transitions which change the dimensionality of the lattice (3D->4D, or 2D->3D, or 1D->2D). Another project focuses on leading order (in alpha') stringy corrections to the hadron spectra in high-curvature holographic QCD models with O(1) 't Hooft couplings. A related issue concerns stringy corrections to the short-distance nuclear forces in models where the dual baryons looks like string stars rather than instantons. The third project is about M theory duals of the heterotic orbifolds, which seem to give paradoxical results, and he hopes to come up with a solution to these puzzles."
0.224532,"Elementary particles have an intrinsic property called spin--they act as if they were constantly spinning around like tops. Just as a tops precess in the presence of gravity, the spins of fundamental particles precess in a magnetic field. This precession is the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance which is the underlying physics used in the medical diagnostic known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently developed precision optical techniques have allowed the study of interactions with particle spins with unprecedented precision. The researchers will use these precision techniques as tools to investigate the fundamental forces and symmetries of nature. At the most basic level, our present understanding of nature is summarized in the ""Standard Model' of particle physics. This model requires four fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak) to describe all of reality as it is presently known. In one experiment, the investigators will look for a new long-range force between particle spins that can't be described by the Standard Model. To optimize their search, they will measure the interaction of their laboratory spins with the sum of all of the electron spins within the Earth. In their other experiment, the researchers hope eventually to see if the fundamental laws of nature might be asymmetric in time. This breaking of ""time symmetry"" can be studied by looking for the precession of a nuclear spin in an electric field. Here the experimental sensitivity can be increased by using a very cold beam of molecules. Additional time asymmetry (beyond that which has already been observed) is believed to be necessary to explain the existence of our universe. Without time-reversal violation, our universe would have produced equal amounts of matter and anti-matter. Their mutual annihilation would not have allowed for the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and life. <br/><br/>Recently, the researchers created the first map of the electron-spin density within the Earth. These ""geo-electrons"" constitute the largest polarized spin source known. Precision measurement of spin-precession frequencies in laboratories at the surface of the Earth as a function of their applied magnetic-field direction, allows one to look for long-range spin-spin interactions (LRSSI) between the geo-electrons and the laboratory spins. In the first proposed experiment, a refined spin-precession apparatus will be constructed which is both well calibrated and relatively immune to AC light effects. This should allow at least an order of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of these measurements to LRSSI. If an effect is seen it would suggest the existence of a new force of nature. In current models this force might be associated with an ultra-light vector meson, a ""dark"" photon, the ""unparticle,"" or torsion gravity. In the second proposed experiment, critical parameters that determine the viability of an electric-dipole moment (edm) experiment in thallium fluoride (TlF) will be investigated using an ultraviolet laser and a cold molecular source. Specifically, the researchers hope to demonstrate the existence of a cycling transition in TlF and to measure the efficiency with which TlF can be ablated from a surface. If the results of these measurements are favorable, TlF will then be proposed as a candidate system for a cold-beam precision measurement of the edm of the thallium nucleus. The discovery of a permanent nuclear edm would imply a violation of time symmetry and could help explain the existence of our matter-dominated universe."
0.318467,"Non-technical description:<br/>The Florida State University cryogenic Penning trap mass spectrometer is currently the world's most precise apparatus for measuring atomic masses (more colloquially, for ""weighing atoms""). The mass of an atom is a basic property and so atomic masses have many important applications in chemistry and physics. In particular, because of the equivalence of energy and mass (through ""E = mc2""), atomic mass differences determine the energy released in nuclear reactions. Although many atomic masses have already been precisely measured, there are several scientifically important applications where measurements at still higher precision are required. These applications include determining the mass of the neutrino, an extremely light and weakly interacting fundamental particle that pervades the universe. For years it was believed that the neutrino had no mass. We now know this not to be the case, and this new knowledge raises fundamental questions concerning the origin and structure of the universe. The project also provides training for student and post-doctoral researchers who are likely to make careers in academe, industry or national laboratories, hence contributing to the scientifically trained workforce.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>Three of the measurements we propose will provide atomic mass differences, or nuclear Q-values, that will be used to test systematics in other projects that seek to set upper limits on the mass of the electron anti-neutrino from low energy beta-decays. These are measurements of the 3T-3He mass difference for the ongoing, very-large-scale tritium beta-decay spectrometer KATRIN; and the mass differences 187Re-187Os and 163Ho-163Dy, for projects that will use micro-calorimeter beta-decay spectrometers. Other measurements on light ions will reduce the uncertainty of the atomic mass of the proton. Another mass difference, 35Cl-36Cl, will enable a check of precision gamma-ray metrology. Measurements of the atomic masses of 40,48Ca are also planned, to enable ongoing precision g-factor measurements of 40,48Ca19+ to test relativistic atomic theory for the g-factor of hydrogen-like ions and to probe the dependence on nuclear structure. The measurements will consist of ratios of cyclotron frequencies of pairs of ions in the 8.5 tesla magnetic field of the FSU Penning trap mass spectrometer. Unique features of this spectrometer include the ability to make and isolate, in the Penning trap, a single ion of nearly any element; phase-coherent detection of the axial motion of an ion, via image currents, using a high-Q super-conducting tuned-circuit coupled to a dc-SQUID; and measurement of the ion's cyclotron frequency by mapping evolved cyclotron phase onto axial motion using an rf pi-pulse at the cyclotron-to-axial coupling frequency. Cyclotron frequency noise due to variation in the magnetic field is reduced by trapping both ions in the pair simultaneously."
0.36,"****Technical Abstract****<br/>A new type of spectroscopy combining optical-pumping of electrons with NMR detection, termed OPNMR, is being developed and applied to a series of important classes of direct-gap III-V semiconductors. OPNMR exploits the optically-oriented electrons, which couple to surrounding nuclear spins; enhanced NMR signals can then be observed. Defect sites and dopants related to optically-relevant defects will be spectroscopically identified. Polarization transfer schemes, whereby signal enhancements in one region travel via nuclear spin diffusion to other regions will be explored, opening up the possibility of new applications of OPNMR. Theory and experimental work will be closely coupled in this project with calculations of the bandstructure and spin-dependent optical transitions, and an industrial partner will assist in selection of heterostructure devices for analysis. Ancillary benefits of this research will include models of OPNMR phenomena for these methods to be applied to II-VI and Group IV semiconductors. Graduate students will be educated and trained in cutting-edge spectroscopy techniques, which enables them to pursue careers in a variety of areas including lasers, semiconductor devices, NMR/MRI spectroscopy, and it builds both knowledge and experience in chemistry, physics, and engineering. Experience working with an industrial partner will be invaluable to help students make informed career choices and to provide contacts for future research opportunities.<br/><br/>****Non-technical Abstract****<br/>Cutting-edge spectroscopic tools are being developed that combine lasers with nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR (a technique that is closely-related to MRI's used in medicine), to study semiconductors. Semiconductor materials are of enormous economic and industrial importance because these form the basic building blocks for electronic components and equipment. Semiconductors are a type of material that act as a ""pipeline"" for electrons, controlling where and how electrons flow inside the material, such as in computer chips or the pixels in digital cameras. By shining laser light onto the semiconductor, electrons are generated. Understanding how these photoexcited electrons behave is important to device performance, and the laser+NMR techniques are used to monitor the electron spins through their interactions with the surroundings. In this project, graduate students will be educated and trained in these advanced technologies, which enables them to pursue careers in a variety of areas (i.e., lasers, semiconductor devices, NMR/MRI spectroscopy), and it builds knowledge and experience in chemistry, physics, and engineering. The collaborative team includes an industrial partner thus offering real-world experience for our students, and a broader commercially-focused perspective to the senior (academic) personnel on this project."
0.468654,"For several microseconds after the big bang the entire universe passed through a phase called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). More than a million times hotter than the sun, the QGP is a form of matter governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where the individual quarks and gluons localized within nucleons are expected to scatter out over distances and times many times larger than a femtometer (fm). Only in the last ten years has it become possible to create and study this form of matter in the laboratory using the fleetingly short-lived nuclear sized droplets of plasma created in the aftermath of a heavy-ion collision. The very short lifetime (10 fm/c, where c is the speed of light) and small size (10 fm) have made the study of this matter a theoretical and experimental challenge. The modification of hard QCD jets (bundles of strongly interacting particles) as they pass through this exotic form of matter presents the best tool to date to study the various properties of the QGP. The goal of the research supported by this grant is to continue to formulate both a systematic and sophisticated approach to the theoretical study of these modified jets. Considerable effort will be directed towards a deeper understanding of the factorization of the hard jet cascade from the soft rescattering experienced by the patrons in the jet, as they propagate through the QGP. Yet another goal will be to numerically simulate the partonic cascade process within the dense medium to better understand the event-by-event characteristics of such modified showers. A third goal will be a rigorous analysis of the data within the framework of perturbative QCD based jet modification to isolate the transport properties of the plasma and place stringent error bars on the extracted transport coefficients of jets in a QGP.<br/><br/>This research, at the intersection of particle and nuclear physics, will greatly enhance our understanding of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD in the complicated environments of a dynamically expanding quark gluon plasma. It will introduce state of the art numerical tools to simulate such processes. It will lead to the training of graduate students in both the sophisticated analytical approaches used as well as the numerical simulation tools used in such efforts. The project also includes an outreach effort to convey the latest results from such analyses as well as from other new cutting edge fields to the general public."
0.599998,"One of the most difficult unanswered problems in nuclear and particle physics is how to understand systems in which the components are so tightly bound together that it is impossible to separate them, as occurs inside the proton and neutron and many other particles. This project is designed to explore several methods of obtaining definitive information from such complicated systems, so that one can understandand how they are put together and why they interact the way they do. For most of the approaches to be researched, the investigators initiated the development of the methods used here. This project emphasizes collaborative work with researchers at several other universities and laboratories. The educational component represents an important part of the work to be performed here. The project allows for the training of graduate and undergraduate students both on the analytical aspects of theory, and will also make possible the mentoring of these students for success in their future carreers in industry or academia. <br/><br/>This project includes six specific problems that will be studied, three each for the PI and co-PI in areas of their respective expertise, all related to the question of how to understand systems in which the component particles are so tightly bound that it is difficult or impossible to separate them, such as inside protons and neutrons. These specific problems are 1) how the proton and neutron would be assembled if the strong nuclear force that holds them together had a different number of interaction charges than the three in our universe; 2) how best to extract the maximal amount of information about their detailed internal structure from experiments; 3) how to compute their actual dynamical interactions in a strong-force theory that is a realistic simplified model of the one studied experimentally, and 4) how closely this idealized theory appears to mimic the real one, since much more can be computed exactly from the ideal than from the real theory; 5) how to simulate the structure of an atom, much smaller than conventional atoms, formed from particles (muons) that appear in cosmic rays, which is guaranteed to exist but has not yet been experimentally observed; and 6) using a connection between strongly-interacting theories and gravity in curved spacetimes to study systems in which the strongly-interacting particles have such a high ambient energy that they can be said to have a finite temperature."
0.6,"Nature has intrinsic handedness because of the weak interaction, but the difference between the left- and right-handed cases is barely discernible in atomic and nuclear interactions. Understanding its strength in nuclei is possible through measurements that require francium atoms so cold that they barely move. They show the effects of the handedness, from the anapole moment, when they are set to oscillate, and their frequency of oscillation changes with the handedness. The researchers will study the weak interaction, the force responsible for the beginning of the solar cycle, inside the francium nucleus. The atoms, made in the accelerator at TRIUMF Vancouver Canada, will be held on a laser trap, excited with microwaves and generate signals that show the handedness of nature.<br/><br/>This international effort, with active participants from the USA, Canada, and Mexico, as well as Australia and China, is an example of multinational collaboration that is enabling investigations at the frontier of physics. The research will allow US graduate and undergraduate students to obtain valuable global perspectives in science, and be educated in the boundary between atomic molecular and optical physics and nuclear physics. In addition, undergraduates from Mexico, through a program with the Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica, will participate in the summer at TRIUMF. The recently commissioned Francium Trapping Facility at TRIUMF is available for visits by the general public."
0.32,"Research in Fundamental Nuclear and Particle Physics is being categorized in three areas: At the ""Energy Frontier"", physicists hope to discover new physics, e.g. new symmetries or particles, by colliding particles with increasingly high energy. At the ""Cosmic Frontier"", physicists use the cosmos as a laboratory that contains detectable information about new physics. And finally, at the ""Precision Frontier"", physicists attempt to measure quantities that are believed to be known very precisely, and to interpret deviations from the known physics predictions as a signal for new physics. This award supports a measurement of the third type, a precision measurement of several observables in free neutron beta decay which serve to better understand the fundamental interactions between elementary particles. The process of beta decay has been incorporated into the standard model of elementary particle physics, which gives us a successful description of elementary particle processes. A discovery of new physics would have a critical impact on Nuclear and High Energy Physics, and on Cosmology. Being on the forefront of scientific research and on the edge of what is technologically feasible, the project will serve as a training ground for future generations of scientists. Most of the research will be done by students at the undergraduate and graduate level. <br/><br/>This grant supports the effort to design, construct, commission, and operate the Nab spectrometer. The spectrometer will use the state of the art neutron beamline (FNPB) at the new Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge, TN to determine the two-dimensional energy distribution of decay electron and protons in neutron beta decay. The redundancy inherent in the standard model description of the neutron beta decay process allows uniquely sensitive checks of the model's validity and limits, with strong implications in astrophysics. One of the expected observables, the determination of the neutrino-electron-correlation coefficient with a relative uncertainty of 0.1%, will allow an extraction of Vud, the upper left element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, in order to test its unitarity. The current NSAC long range plan finds that ""The only realistic way to improve Vud is via neutron decay."" New results from high energy physics cast a shadow on the unitarity of the CKM matrix, and re-open the possibility of finding hints for new exchange bosons, or a fourth quark generation. The other observable, the determination of the Fierz term, which parametrizes a deviation from the known shape of the spectrum of the decay electrons, to about 0.001, allows finding new particles that mediate scalar or tensor interactions at low energy, in a complementary way and with sensitivity competitive to what is expected from LHC."
0.27,"This project concerns the theoretical exploration of the properties of strongly interacting matter at ultra-high densities (10 to 20 times denser than atomic nuclei) and temperatures (several hundred billion degrees). It is generally accepted by the scientific community that the universe was filled with super-dense matter shortly after the Big Bang. Super-dense matter continues to be created in the final stages of catastrophic stellar events, such as core-collapse supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and it may be present deep inside the cores of collapsed stars, known as neutron stars. Neutron stars are typically about 20 kilometers across and spin rapidly, often making many hundred of rotations per second. A thimble full of neutron star matter would have a mass of one billion tons! At such extraordinary conditions atoms themselves collapse, and atomic nuclei are squeezed so tightly together that new fundamental particles are generated and novel states of matter are created. This makes neutron stars, and the catastrophic stellar events creating them, into excellent astrophysical laboratories for a wide range of physical studies, which are addressed in this project. Theoretical predictions concerning the equation of state of matter under these extreme conditions can be used to compare the results of simulations with observational data accumulating rapidly from both orbiting and ground based observatories spanning the radiation spectrum from X-rays to radio wavelengths.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the role of quark deconfinement for (proto) neutron stars and core-collapse supernova events, using a state-of-the-art (non-local 3-flavor Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio, n3PNJL) model for the description of quark matter. The n3PNJL model accounts for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and mimics quark confinement via the Polyakov loop potential. In recent years, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model has become the workhorse for various studies in theoretical nuclear physics, as it provides a very versatile and numerically treatable approach to the theory of the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics, QCD). This research will consists of five intertwined activities concerning (1) the equation of state of cold quark-hybrid matter; (2) color superconductivity treated in the framework of the n3PNJL model; (3) quark deconfinement in (proto) neutron stars; (4) the properties of a quark-hadron Coulomb lattice that may exist in the cores of neutron stars; and (5) the role of quark deconfinement for core-collapse supernovae. The best available data from heavy ion collisions and neutron star observations will be used to impose the strongest possible constraints on the equation of state that will be developed in the framework of this research project. The equations of state will be made available to the wider nuclear and astrophysics community to explore the birth, structure and evolution of (proto) neutron stars and the events which create them."
0.27,"Advances in the physics goal of understanding the universe at its most fundamental level have shown that matter is composed of a set of fundamental particles that combine to form other particles that group together to generate the structures that we recognize around us. For example, the nucleus of an atom is formed from a mixture of protons and neutrons. These protons and neutrons are made from constituents, called quarks and gluons, which give substructure to these particles. The goal of this project is to determine aspects of the structure of the proton and neutron, and how this structure is affected when placed in the nucleus. The experiments focus on how the quarks are distributed in space and in momentum. An on-going puzzle is whether the proton size is not the same when measured with atomic hydrogen and its counterpart, muonic-hydrogen, where the electron in the hydrogen atom has been replaced by its heavier cousin, the muon. The project includes measurement of electron and muon scattering from protons to provide an independent measurement of the proton radius. In addition to the direct scientific goals of the project, the experiments provide students and young scientists experience and training in working in the international collaborations of modern scientific experiments, with state of the art technology.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposal is study the structure of the nucleon. The ongoing Fermilab SEAQUEST experiment uses Drell-Yan cross sections to determine the ratio of anti-d to anti-u quarks in the nucleon as a function of quark momentum, to study transverse momentum distributions, to investigate the EMC effect, to study quark energy loss in cold nuclear matter, and to investigate the possible existence of dark photons in a parameter region of higher mass but lower coupling constant to ordinary matter. The Fermilab MINERvA experiment provides a complementary view of nucleon and nuclear structure by scattering few GeV neutrinos from protons and from nuclei. At Jefferson Lab, experiments on tritium targets will be run in 2017. The MARATHON experiment, through a comparison of deep inelastic scattering of electrons on 3H to 3He, provides information on the ratio of the proton and neutron F2 structure functions at high x, testing decades old perturbative quantum chromodynamics model calculations. The preliminary phases of creating a new experiment to elastically scatter muons and electrons from the proton, the MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, are in progress, with the goal of measuring the distribution of charge in the proton."
0.3,"This research project addresses mechanisms underlying the strong interaction of subatomic physics in terms of the confined quarks and gluons described by that part of the Standard Model known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We implement a continuum nonperturbative approach based on the Dyson-Schwinger equations of QCD which preserves the short distance renormalization group behavior of perturbative QCD while the infrared domain is described by one parameter to generate the empirical amount of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. The latter phenomenon is the source for the generation of at least 98% of the mass of known stable matter in the universe, and it guides the development of our theoretical methods.<br/><br/>This work will analyze and interpret information about the quark and gluon structure of sub-atomic particles produced by the Jefferson Laboratory at Newport News Virginia (JLab), and provide predictions for the experiments anticipated from the upgrade currently being undertaken. Theoretical work of this type informs and motivates a portfolio of fundamental physics programs at sub-atomic physics laboratories across the world. Specific physics issues addressed include parton distributions of the pion and kaon mesons, the transition or generalized parton distributions of the pion and kaon mesons, the elastic and transition form factors of pions for a complete range of momentum transfer, and an extension to nucleon parton distributions, and their ratios. We anticipate a by-product will be a new understanding of the mass scale for transition from non-perturbative to perturbative dynamics in the pion charge form factor. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the program include the cross-fertilization of nuclear and particle physics, a return on the investment in the experimental facilities at JLab and RHIC, and integration of research and education through the research training of graduate students in connection with undergraduate teaching. The interactions of graduate students with scientists who are prominent nationally and internationally is a contribution to the nation's infrastructure for research and education. The PI uses examples from this research program to illustrate key elements of core graduate classes in Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear and Particle Physics. The PI supervises an informal seminar course for graduate students and postdoctoral associates to discuss and present aspects of QCD and field theory that underly this research program. The collaboration with overseas colleagues will enhance international cooperation in science research and education."
0.045,"The study of fundamental symmetries in the field of nuclear physics explores the nature of the matter, energy, and forces that define the universe and that have allowed stars, planets, and life to emerge and flourish. This award will support the PI and undergraduate students to work on two experiments that will further our understanding of that universe. The first experiment, called MuSun, addresses one of the most important limitations of calculations related to the proton-proton fusion process that releases most of the energy in stars like the Sun. It will provide data that will calibrate the least precise parts of these calculations and can also be applied to other important nuclear reactions. The second, known as the Muon g-2 experiment, tests our Standard Model of particles and their interactions. While this model has been remarkably successful, it is not complete. The previous generation of this experiment uncovered a strong hint of a discrepancy between its measurement and the Standard Model's prediction; the new experiment will probe it with enough precision to potentially claim a discovery.<br/><br/>Students will have opportunities to carry out guided research related to the larger physics goals, to work at major research facilities, and to attend conferences and collaboration meetings. This grant will provide opportunities to involve and support a talented and diverse group of science students that includes women, members of underrepresented ethnic groups, and first-generation college students.<br/><br/>MuSun measures the rate of muon capture in deuterium, a fundamental two-nucleon process that provides a calibration of effective field theories of weak interactions in light nuclei. The muon capture process studied by the MuSun experiment is analogous to reactions that include proton-proton fusion and the deuteron breakup reactions that were used to detect neutrinos at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The MuSun result will dramatically improve the precision of the low-energy constants describing two-nucleon terms in chiral effective field theories that describe these reactions. The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab will be the group's primary focus for this grant period. This experiment measures the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon by observing the rate of spin precession of a muon beam as it circulates in a precisely shimmed storage ring magnet. The spin polarization precesses because of coupling to virtual particles, including all of the particles described by the Standard Model and potentially any new, as-yet-undiscovered particles and interactions that are beyond it. The Regis group will be responsible for the implementation, installation, commissioning, and analysis for the fiber harp beam monitors and entrance counters for this experiment. The measurement clearly has the potential to discover new physics beyond the Standard Model. When the existing precision of 0.5 parts per million from the Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment is compared with modern Standard Model calculations, there is a discrepancy of more than three standard deviations; the probability of a fluctuation at this level by chance is less than one in a thousand. As the precision of the experiment reaches its 0.14 part-per-million goal, the discrepancy could exceed the discovery threshold of five standard deviations. Such a finding could represent the discovery of supersymmetry, new gauge bosons such as dark photons, or other new particles or interactions."
0.09,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. The Standard Model of particle interactions describes known fundamental particles and their interactions. However, the Standard Model in its simplest form does not include a nonzero mass of the neutrino, for which there is now experimental proof. This calls for a continued effort to improve the Standard Model, and to further our knowledge of neutrino properties and interactions. Neutrino scattering from the nucleus, which leaves the nucleus intact, was first described some forty years ago, but still lacks an experimental demonstration. An accurate measurement of this mode of neutrino interaction, as planned here, will provide a handle on several still unconstrained neutrino properties, contributing information that helps to formulate refinements to the Standard Model.<br/><br/><br/>This research will use sodium-doped cesium iodide scintillators as an advantageous target for the detection of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering, exploiting the intense neutrino yield from the Spallation Neutron Source facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The response of this material to low-energy nuclear recoils, like those expected from this process, has been characterized and a full feasibility test has been performed using a 2 kg low-background prototype crystal in a dedicated radiation shield. Based on these studies, a planned 14 kg detector is expected to measure approximately 550 events per year from this mode of neutrino interaction. The still unmeasured neutron-generating charged-current neutrino interaction on Pb-208, of interest in nuclear physics and for supernova detection, will also be studied during the period of the award."

0.069876,"A faculty member and his undergraduates at Central Michigan University were collaborators in the construction, assembly, and testing of the one million dollar Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) which was completed in 2004. Subsequently, the collaboration received a $1.3 Million NSF grant to construct the Large multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA). The MoNA LISA neutron detector tandem is used with the Sweeper magnet at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The main purpose of MoNA LISA is to extract masses of neutron-unbound nuclei and excitation energies of unbound states. The physics to be addressed is that of light, very neutron-rich nuclei located in the direct vicinity of the drip line or even beyond. This is the domain of very weakly bound nucleonic matter where fascinating new phenomena have already been observed, such as halos or drastic changes in shell structure. The MoNA LISA and Sweeper detection system is ideally suited to explore the intrinsic structure of near drip line nuclei by studying the properties of their ground and low excited states. It will also provide information about low-lying resonances located just above the particle emission threshold in nuclei at the drip line and beyond. Finally, the detectors are designed in such a way that they can readily measure neutrons in coincidence so that correlations between emitted neutrons can be investigatedin detail as well.<br/><br/>The MoNA collaboration is in a unique situation that is quite different from any other collaboration or research group proposing experiments at the NSCL. Specifically it first allowed professors from predominantly undergraduate institutions and their undergraduate students to participate in the construction of a top-level research instrument. The group has answered the challenge to transform from construction to production. We have built a unique analysis scheme that allows the undergraduate programs to be involved in the running, reduction, and analysis of MoNA experiments. As a result, 112 undergraduates have had the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge nuclear physics experiments. Additionally, Central Michigan University has aggressively worked to expose high school students and their teachers to experimental nuclear physics, and has even brought MoNA to Michigan state legislators and their staffs."

0.301286,"This project addresses current issues of interest concerning the structure of the Universe. The investigator and his students will focus on the study of matter in compact stars, as natural laboratories that provide extreme densities and strong magnetic fields. One of the important components of the project concerns the training of graduate and undergraduate students by involving them into a modern research program in theoretical nuclear physics. The students are expected to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills that will be applied in their future careers in industry or academia. The integration of the principle investigator's research with education at the Arizona State University with a substantial enrollment of underrepresented groups of students will contribute to a high-quality education in science and engineering, as well as to the development of human resources in the region.<br/><br/>This project will apply quantum field theoretical methods to study fundamental properties of relativistic matter in magnetic fields. The corresponding relativistic types of matter with strong magnetic fields are relevant for the phenomenology of compact stars, the evolution of the Early Universe, and the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. Therefore, the project will add to a deeper understanding of numerous phenomena in the natural world and will expand the knowledge about the phases of strongly interacting matter and their role in the cosmos. The theoretical methods and research outcomes of this project will also extend beyond the realm of theoretical nuclear physics. In particular, the results of these studies will be useful in the context of quasi-relativistic condensed matter materials, which hold a great promise for future applications."
1.082957,"Intellectual Merit of Project: Trafficking of regulatory proteins into the cell nucleus, where genetic information is stored and processed, is fundamental to the organization and functioning of all living cells. Not surprisingly, this cellular traffic control is highly regulated and is directed by special signals called nuclear localization signals (NLS's), found within proteins destined for the nucleus. The NLS's directly interact with special transport proteins called importins that help guide the cargo into the nucleus. This project explores the signals regulating traffic control of thyroid hormone receptors, essential proteins which either activate or silence the expression of target genes in response to thyroid hormone, and play a pivotal role in development and metabolism. Specifically, the project will determine: 1) which importin serves as the primary carrier for the two NLS's in the thyroid hormone receptor; 2) the role that multiple NLS's play in regulating thyroid hormone receptor distribution and functional diversification, and 3) whether protein turn-over and routing to the proteasome, a special cellular component that acts like a garbage disposal system, play a role in thyroid hormone receptor trafficking. The thyroid hormone receptor provides an excellent model system for studying the role of multiple import and export signals in mediating traffic control of key regulatory proteins in the cell. This research will enhance general understanding of NLS structure and function, refine predictive tools, and provide insight into how a dynamic balance between nuclear import, retention, and degradation of regulatory proteins modulates the expression of essential genes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of Project: A fruitful collaboration with faculty and undergraduates at Hampton University, an HBCU, will be continued. Opportunity for a diversity of undergraduates to gain hands-on experience with the scientific process will be provided. In the wider context, new techniques will be introduced to the departmental confocal microscope user group, and research activities will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course taught each Fall. Master's students will have the opportunity to gain experience in lab management and to develop their teaching skills through training and supervising undergraduates in the lab. This project will contribute substantially to human resource development in science, by preparing undergraduates and graduate students to go on to other graduate programs, medical school, veterinary school, secondary education, and industry, to name a few. In particular, this project will enhance the professional development of participants from groups underrepresented in science."
0.332091,"The Particle and Nuclear Physics group at James Madison University aims to be a key contributor to state of the art research in Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics while providing an outstanding educational experience for undergraduate students. The three faculty members and their students focus on research designed to explore the structure of nucleons (neutrons and protons) which are the basic building blocks of any atomic nucleus. While it is understood that nucleons are composed of three interacting (via gluon exchange) quarks (viewed as fundamental particles) the picture of the mechanisms that give rise and govern the evolution of multi-quark systems (protons, neutrons, nuclei) is not yet complete. <br/><br/>The group participates in studies aimed at clarifying this picture by charting the structure of nuclei and nucleons using electron, muon, and photon probes. Group members are deeply involved in the efforts of building the hardware (detector development), software, as well as the organizational infrastructure needed to carry out this research program. <br/><br/>Currently the group is actively involved in ongoing research at Jefferson Lab in experimental Halls A, B, and C (inclusive electron scattering off the nucleon, duality studies, strangeness production) and Fermilab (the muon gyromagnetic constant, g-2). Additionally, the JMU-PNP group members are key participants in detector and software development (Hall C: scintillator hodoscope detector, ROOT/C++ data analysis code; Hall B: forward tagger, preshower calorimeter) that is part of the 12 GeV energy upgrade at Jefferson Lab and are principal investigators on experiments that will take advantage of this upgrade. <br/><br/>The group's success can be measured through the number of publications, signaling the deepening of our understanding of subnuclear matter. Equally as important success can be gauged also through the number of undergraduate students that gain invaluable experience by pursuing research in our group."
0.37,"Investigating the rarest of processes between elementary particles is a very powerful tool in understanding Nature at its most fundamental level. The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) program investigates the fundamental nature of the neutrino, that intriguing elementary particle that for a long time was thought to have no mass, doesn't interact with much of anything, and may hold the key to why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe. The EXO program carries out its study of the neutrino by searching for the existence of a nuclear decay called neutrino-less double beta decay. Beta decay involves the emission of an electron from the nucleus, and is always accompanied by the emission of an antineutrino. Neutrino-less double beta decay would be a process in which a nucleus (xenon-136 in this case) transforms by emitting two electrons (and nothing else). According to the Standard Model of particle physics, this can only happen if neutrinos and antineutrinos are exactly the same. Such a direct overlap between matter and antimatter could prove essential in answering one of the most fundamental questions in science: why is our Universe made exclusively of matter? <br/><br/>The first experiment of the program, EXO-200, uses 200 kg of liquefied xenon enriched in the 136 isotope as a source and has operated at the underground Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico since 2010. EXO-200 is set to run for another 3 years, and this award will support the PI and his group for up to three years. The accumulated data will allow scientists to probe the existence of neutrino-less double beta decay should this process happen with a characteristic half-life of up four million billion times the current age of the universe. The detector technology used in EXO-200 pioneers the use of selected materials with ultra-low levels of residual radioactivity in order to produce the most radio-quiet environment for the detection of rare events. Some of these cleanliness protocols and requirements are now reaching the electronics and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, the large noble liquid detectors, such as the one used in EXO-200, are finding increased applications outside of particle physics, in particular in nuclear reactor fuel cycle and composition monitoring and in medical imaging (e.g. PET scan machines). The EXO-200 project is proving an ideal stage for graduate students to grow into researchers with both data analysis and hardware expertise. The UMass group has a track record of successfully involving a diverse population of undergraduate students in core areas of the project. The newly established Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions provides a stimulating and productive environment for a broad scientific exchange between experimentalists and theorists. <br/><br/>The UMass group plays a central role in fully exploiting the data from the EXO-200 experiment. The chosen xenon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) technology allows the project to take advantage of the radiation self-shielding properties of high-Z xenon, in a homogeneous layout with excellent event tracking capability and energy resolution. The work includes a comprehensive study of processes with spatial topology, such as bb decay of 136Xe to excited states of 136Ba, 137Xe background, and high energy gamma-rays originating from cosmic muon interactions with detector components. An integral part of the proposal is a laboratory program at UMass to test optical properties of various detector materials and surfaces in liquid xenon and to use the results from these measurements in a ray-tracing optical simulation of EXO-200. Together with focused tests of novel detectors for the Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV) scintillation light produced in xenon (silicon photo-multipliers in particular), they are part of investigations under way towards a tonne-scale, next generation experiment (nEXO) for neutrinoless double beta decay."
0.310095,"The fundamental goal of nuclear science is to understand all forms of nuclear matter, e.g., the origin and structure of the nucleus at core of the atom, and the nucleons and their quark and gluon constituents which account for nearly all of the mass of the visible universe. Over the last decade, hard exclusive reactions have emerged as a class of processes providing novel information on the parton (quark and gluon) distributions in hadrons - the particles sensitive to the strong force. Factorization theorems allow for expressing amplitudes in terms of the Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), which are expected to provide a universal description of nucleon structure in both momentum and coordinate space. Experimentally, access to the transverse spatial structure relies on asymptotic freedom, allowing the hard interaction of the experimental probe with one parton to be unambiguously separated from the residual soft interaction of the struck parton with the rest of the hadron. In a kinematic regime where hard-soft factorization applies, exclusive measurements of a photon or meson originating from the struck parton can be used to create a tomographic image of the nucleon. This project plays an important role in these studies, specifically through the PI's exclusive photon and meson production experiments at Jefferson Lab, which will be essential for a reliable interpretation of the results from the GPD program at both 6 GeV and 12 GeV. <br/><br/>Young scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students play an integral part in this project, which provides them with opportunities to further their training and education. These will include the opportunity to gain experience in the design, assembly, and testing of modern instrumentation for the detection of radiation and subatomic particles, fast signal processing electronics, and scientific data analysis. Furthermore, learning to work in a large international scientific community will prepare young scientists and students for the modern work environment at academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry. The PI's research projects have contributed significantly to the education of graduate and undergraduate, and, over the past three years, ten high school students. She has considerable experience working with minority students, and by providing a female role model, she could encourage women to pursue advanced studies in physics."
0.15,"Neutrinos are some of the most intriguing elementary particles that make up the Standard Model of particle physics. They were long thought to have no mass, don?t interact with much of anything, and may hold the key to why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe. Neutrinos are commonly observed in beta decay, a radioactive process that involves the emission of an electron (or its antiparticle the positron) from the nucleus, and which is always accompanied by the emission of a neutrino (or its antiparticle the antineutrino) as well. This research focuses on the search for what is called neutrino-less double beta decay, where an initial nucleus with atomic weight and number (A,Z) is transformed into a nucleus of (A, Z + 2) with the emission of only two electrons and nothing else. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, this can only happen if neutrinos and antineutrinos are exactly the same, that is, the neutrino is its own antiparticle. It is believed that this overlap between matter and antimatter could prove essential in answering one of the most fundamental questions in science: why is our Universe made exclusively of matter?<br/><br/>The research uses the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments. The NEMO-3 experiment employed thin foils of particular nuclear isotopes surrounded by detectors that could provide 3D particle tracking of the decay electrons. This unique technique provides several observables for each registered event, offering a powerful means to identify double beta decays and to reject background processes. SuperNEMO will further exploit the NEMO-3 technique. The research group supported by this award will continue its participation in the NEMO-3 data analysis and in the construction of the first SuperNEMO module (""Demonstrator""). Through their activities, the group will educate and train young researchers in building state-of-the-art research instruments and science projects. They will work towards building on the University of Texas at Austin campus an exhibit gallery illustrating the discovery, the underlying physics, and applications of natural radioactivity, cosmic rays, and related subatomic phenomena. <br/><br/>The NEMO-3 analysis has already yielded high precision measurements of double beta half-lives for seven isotopes and set some of the most stringent constraints on the neutrino-less transitions, yielding an upper limit for the effective neutrino mass of (0.3-0.9)eV, where the span reflects uncertainties in the nuclear matrix element. The SuperNEMO aspects include designing and fabrication of the central source foil frame, the light injection and calorimeter monitoring system, and the Bi-207 calibration deployment. For the next three years, a critical period for completing and commissioning the Demonstrator, the group will complete hardware commitments and will participate in analysis of data from the new experiment."
0.18,"This project seeks answers to two of the overarching questions central to nuclear physics: ""How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge?"", and ""Are the fundamental interactions that are basic to the structure of matter fully understood?"". The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is successful at describing interactions of elementary particles, but it is known to be incomplete, because the SM fails to describe phenomena that shape our universe, like the difference between matter and anti-matter or the nature of dark matter. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the strong force binds three light elementary particles, quarks, to make massive composite particles, proton and neutrons, are not well understood quantitatively. Over ninety nine percent of the mass of the visible matter in the universe is generated by the strong force in this way. In this context, the PIs are involved in two experimental programs using the electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, first to investigate the internal structure of the proton as a means of investigating the nature of the strong force, and second to search for physics beyond the Standard Model by performing precision measurements of interactions with precise Standard Model predictions. The PIs will train two graduate students and undergraduate students in carrying out the research program, and will engage in STEM outreach activities through the ""Adopt a physicist"" program. <br/><br/>This project will support in part the use of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering of electrons from the proton to produce a 3-D tomographic picture of the internal structure of the proton against which models of the strong force can be tested. Roche is one of the spoke persons for experiment E12-06-114 at JLab, and this project will support the data taking and data analysis for this experiment. The immediate goal of this experiment is to test the hypothesis of scaling on which the Generalized Parton Distribution formalism used to interpret this kind of experiments is based. The second project supported by this award will further the involvement of the PIs and their students in the JLab parity violating electron scattering experiments, QWEAK and MOLLER. These experiments test the Standard Model by studying the electromagnetic and weak forces in electron-proton and electron-electron scattering. The PIs will continue their work with QWEAK up to publication of the final results, and will use their expertise in data acquisition and software development for the preparation of the MOLLER experiment."

0.526442,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.271649,"Non-technical description:<br/><br/>This grant supports the acquisition of a laser system at Smith College, an undergraduate women's liberal arts college. This system will enable two main developments, the first of which is the next generation of a technique called ""Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)"" which is expected to significantly improve the ability of the U.S. to monitor activity at known and suspected nuclear reprocessing sites, as well as to analyze ice core samples for climate history studies. The second development involves the measurement of several energy levels of neutral beryllium to high precision, which improves our understanding of atomic theory and helps to advance basic science. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/><br/>To perform trace analysis with krypton (in support of the first development described in the paragraph above), krypton atoms first need to be transferred to a metastable state for laser cooling and trapping. The precision of most Atom Trap Trace Analysis measurements is currently limited by the methods used to produce the metastable atomic beams. Replacing these methods with the optical source funded here will lead to significant advances such as an increase in detection efficiency, a decrease in sample size, and elimination of cross-sample contamination. The beryllium project (the second development described in the paragraph above) aims to improve experimental measurements on several energy levels and the ionization threshold. Currently, theoretical estimates of the energy levels have more than an order of magnitude more precision than experimental measurements. These improved experimental results will delineate various theoretical models, test quantum electrodynamics, and help determine the nuclear charge radius of beryllium."
0.994507,"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been a long standing model system in the biological sciences for studies of photosynthesis, flagellar development and other aspects of cell biology. Recently, as a fast-growing, photosynthetic eukaryote, Chlamydomonas has attracted a great deal of interest as a source of biomass and renewable energy. University of Minnesota-Twin Cities houses the Chlamydomonas Resource Center (CRC) and its utility is enhanced by the availability of the sequence of the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. CRC has a large collection of mutants and a complete genetic map linked to the molecular map. The PI serves as the new Director of CRC and, in its 30th year of operation, this stock collection center will continue to act as the central repository to receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute wild type and mutant cultures of C. reinhardtii. The Center will continue to maintain and distribute molecular tools for Chlamydomonas research, including genomic and cDNA clones of Chlamydomonas nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, and cDNA libraries. The Center will continue to distribute teaching kits, with reagents, strains and instructions for high school and beginning college biology class experiments.

0.151058,"To first order, the Earth is divided into three concentric shells of different nature: the metallic core, the rocky mantle, and the fluid atmosphere/hydrosphere. While samples are available from the mantle and atmosphere/hydrosphere, the nature and composition of the core remain poorly understood. In particular, the core is known to be less dense than pure iron-nickel alloy, indicating that another light element is present in the core, possibly oxygen, silicium, or sulfur. The conditions (pressure and temperature) under which Earth's core formed and the nature of the light element in Earth's core are two major unresolved questions in planetary sciences. Because no core samples are directly available for study, scientists rely on remote seismic observations or other indirect methods to address those questions. In the proposed work, the approaches of geochemistry (the chemistry of the Earth), mineral physics (solid state physics applied to natural materials), and computational techniques will be combined to set limits on the temperature condition during core formation and the nature of the light element in Earth's core. This will be achieved by examining the extent to which different isotopic flavors of silicon and iron were partitioned between metal and silicate when the core formed. The work will involve synthesizing minerals in the laboratory and compressing them to pressure conditions relevant to the deep Earth by confining the samples between two diamonds, measuring the strength of the iron bonds in those minerals at a synchrotron source that produces very energetic X-rays, and examining, through computer calculations, the behavior of matter under high pressure and temperature. This work can impact many fields of science, ranging from the origin of Earth's dynamo to characterization of extrasolar planets through measurement of their mass. All PIs will actively engage in training and educating graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs in the proposed research projects. The PIs will continue developing SciPhon, a user-friendly, free software for NRIXS data reduction. This program will be made available to various communities studying different aspects of NRIXS, including geochemistry, mineral physics, material sciences, condensed matter physics, and biochemistry. All PIs will be actively involved in outreach programs including the UTeach Outreach Program that conducts academic summer camps for underrepresented K-12 kids from the Austin and southwest Texas area. <br/><br/><br/>The mass of the Earth and its accretion history are such that core-mantle differentiation was probably unavoidable but considerable uncertainties remain as to how and when this took place. Our limited understanding of this major event arises from our lack of sampling of Earth's deep interior. Scientists have devised indirect approaches to address this shortcoming by relying on (1) mineral physics experiments to reproduce the high pressure-temperature conditions prevailing in Earth's interior, (2) theoretical calculations to mimic those same conditions, and (3) geochemical measurements of the composition of mantle rocks to search for telltale signatures of core formation. These strongly interweaved approaches have led to significant progress but first-order unanswered questions remain, such as under what pressure-temperature conditions did the core form, what is the nature of the light element in the core, and did core formation fractionate Si and Fe isotopes. Terrestrial basalts have non-chondritic Si and Fe isotopic compositions, which could reflect partitioning of these elements into the core, although other interpretations exist. The investigators propose to establish Si and Fe isotope fractionation factors using high-pressure nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) and theoretical calculations at deep mantle conditions via collaborative approaches in geochemistry (Dauphas), theoretical ab initio calculations (Wentzcovitch), and experimental mineral physics (Lin). The derived force constants of Si and Fe bonds in basaltic glasses, lower-mantle minerals (bridgmanite and ferropericlase), and Fe alloys will allow us to build a deep-Earth geochemical model to evaluate if the specific Si and Fe isotopic compositions of the silicate Earth reflect core partitioning, and if they do, put constraints on important aspects of core formation such as temperature or the presence of Si as a light element in the core. The experimental results will serve as a benchmark for ab initio calculations of Si and Fe isotopic fractionation between relevant metal and silicate phases at high pressure and temperature. The theoretical work will in turn guide and refine the experimental and geochemical modelling efforts, focusing in particular on nuclear resonant measurements, force constant derivations, anharmonic and spin crossover effects. The exchanges and feedbacks between geochemists and experimental and theoretical physicists involved in this project will provide a holistic view of Si and Fe isotopic fractionation during core formation."
0.317587,"Plants are a prerequisite for life on earth. By performing photosynthesis in the chloroplast, a specialized cell compartment, plants transform light into chemical energy and fix CO2 from the atmosphere. Furthermore, they provide the air we breathe by releasing oxygen, and they represent the main part of our diet. As sessile life forms, plants have to cope with constantly changing, often times harsh, environments. As average temperatures rise, drought and interrelated soil salinity become increasingly problematic for plant performance and agricultural production in the US and globally. Salt stress affects photosynthesis by destroying the fine-tuned ion balance in the chloroplast. This process involves transporter proteins but most genes encoding chloroplast ion transporters are unknown. Dr. Kunz and his group investigate a new set of plant genes and mutants to determine their role in chloroplast ion transport. Moreover, his group is building a genetic tool that allows for testing the relevance of all chloroplast proteins and entire protein families in plant function and photosynthesis. The tool will be applied to precisely determine the genes crucial for plant performance under salt stress. This research will provide critical knowledge and new strategies to increase crop yields even under adverse climatic conditions. Dr. Kunz engages high school students in his research to raise awareness for plant research and its significance for a sustainable future and to excite the future generation of scientist for the world's most fundamental biochemical process, photosynthesis.<br/><br/>Plant photosynthesis is affected by soil salinity but little is known about the genes involved and their potential to improve plant resistance. Salt stress triggers changes in transcription of nuclear encoded chloroplast genes and the chloroplast proteome. Physiologically, salt stress leads to toxic Na+ accumulation in plastids and outcompeting of K+ which disturbs chloroplast ion homeostasis, osmoregulation, and eventually diminishes photosynthetic efficiency. Recently, the first plastid K+ efflux carriers were discovered. Corresponding loss-of-function mutant plants reveal poor photosynthesis under control conditions but, surprisingly, photosynthesis is rescued by salt stress. This emphasizes the potential of manipulating plastid ion flux to increase photosynthetic efficiency during salt stress. However, this approach is hindered by the limited number of characterized plastid ion transporters, most strikingly a chloroplast K+ importer. One hurdle is the high number of gene family members in chloroplasts which often results in functional redundancy and a lack of phenotypes. This project will: 1. Determine the role of plastid K+ channel homologs for K+ import, 2. Define the genes responsible for the unexpected salt stress rescue of plastid K+ efflux carrier mutants. 3. Build and apply a full-coverage artificial library tool to downregulate all nuclear encoded chloroplast genes and gene family transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana and determine the genes responsible for plastid Na+ influx and low photosynthesis during salt stress. 4. Engage and excite high school students in plant science and photosynthesis by providing hands-on molecular biology training in the classroom and the laboratory."
0.1541,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, left over from the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the Galaxy, yielding a sidereal modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. <br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) dark matter experiment is a leader in the field of directional dark matter detection, with sensitivity to the powerful angular signature of nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The collaboration will be testing their next prototype detector, DRIFT-IIe, above ground at Occidental College. It features an inherently scalable design including a redesigned field cage, a texturized, thin-film cathode, a new, transparent wire readout which doubles the fiducial volume per readout, and a new every-wire data acquisition system which allows for lower noise and fiducialization in the detector plane. <br/><br/>The potential of DRIFT's capabilities have promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience."
0.18,"This project will investigate how atoms can be used to test our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature, i.e. our understanding of elementary particles and their interactions. While one can search for new particles directly with large collider facilities, it is also possible to test the effects that new particles could have on processes occurring in atoms and molecules. Such experiments require very high precision and a very good understanding of the systems that are being studied. Moreover, certain atoms and molecules might be much better suited to the studies of fundamental interactions owing to their having properties that enhance desired effects. This project will investigate which systems are the best for future studies of this kind. The experimental work in this field also requires theoretical analysis of the experiments, and this work will provide such analysis and will develop methods to improve the accuracy further. This research is at the interface of atomic physics with high-energy physics, nuclear physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. While the main goal of this project is to study fundamental symmetries, the methodologies described in this project are applicable to the development of atomic clocks, laser cooling and trapping, study of super-heavy elements, production and control of ultracold molecules, study of degenerate quantum gases, astrophysics, plasma physics, and nuclear physics. Graduate students will be directly involved in the forefront research under this grant and will present the research at the scientific meetings.<br/><br/>The main objective of this research is to develop theoretical methods to advance fundamental symmetry tests with atomic and molecular systems in the search of new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project is focused on the study of parity violation and the search for a permanent electric-dipole moment (EDM). The group will develop theoretical methods that will allow identification of the best systems for the next generation of experiments and provide calculations that are crucial for the analysis of current and past experiments. Specific efforts include: (1) introduce the Sturm basis sets and test the performance of all the group?s existing methods using more compact and regular Sturmian basis set functions; (2) develop an accurate method to evaluate contributions of highly-excited states in the sum-over-state approach in order to resolve present problems with the analysis of the most precise parity non-conservation (PNC) study in Cesium; (3) develop a next-generation Configuration Interaction+all-order code for accurate calculations of PNC amplitudes relevant to current experimental research; (4) explore the addition of the effective Hamiltonian to the molecular configuration interaction (CI) code for the study of diatomic molecules."
0.009562,"Mankind's energy usage is a staggering 15,000,000,000,000 watts, 80% of which is from fossil fuels that produce about 9,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide believed to be a major contributor to global climate concerns. The goal of displacing this fossil fuel based energy production is a daunting problem requiring the equivalent of 10,000 nuclear, solar, wind or hydroelectric carbon-free power plants. To put this in perspective, currently worldwide, there are only 441 nuclear power plants and far fewer renewable energy sources. For this reason, most of the effort in stemming the growth of energy demand is focused not on production, but on efficient energy consumption. To that end, this team proposes to commercialize ""engineered semiconductor building blocks"" (engineered substrates) that will enable customers to create major advances in energy efficient electronic power and lighting devices enabling massive energy savings through improved power efficiency. The initial focus of the team's efforts will be to demonstrate engineered substrates using a recently patented technology useful for emerging markets in power electronics and UV and green light emitters (known as LEDS). These engineered substrates will allow (a) various semiconductor devices to be fabricated with higher quality/performance for devices currently being produced and (b) existing manufacturers to expand into new devices that have higher performance and are currently not achievable by any competing method.<br/><br/>This I-Corps team will conduct a detailed market survey of existing nitride substrate template technologies, including their cost, material quality, production value, and time to delivery. The team will identify customers within the Nitride community with experience in device design and growth using traditional non-native substrates (e.g., Silicon, SiC) and native templates (AlN and GaN). This team will conduct detailed customer surveys to understand the desired material quality and doping levels. The insight provided by these customers through direct surveys of their experience will be invaluable to maturing the proposed technology into a production ready product offering. It is critical that the team members understand the existing device performance metrics from the perspective of the customer, so that they can identify the key issues and challenges for which the team can provide an immediate solution and generate direct marketable impact for the customer. This team will also survey customers on pricing structure, and identify what they would be willing to pay for engineered substrates customized to their specifications."
0.220851,"Helium is one of the most important geochemical tracers of Earth's internal composition and evolution. It consists of two isotopes: 3He, which has a primordial origin, and 4He, which is the product of uranium and thorium decay. The ratio of these two isotopes in samples derived from Earth's mantle is variable, as are the ratios for many other elements. A long-standing question is how the observed heterogeneity in isotopic composition relates to the heterogeneity that is observed by other means, including seismic imaging. To answer this question, it is necessary to know on what length scales isotope heterogeneity can persist in Earth's mantle over geological time, against diffusive and convective mixing. Because helium is a highly mobile element in geological materials, it can provide a lower limit on the length scale of heterogeneous regions that are sampled by geochemical methods. However, while the mobility of helium has been determined experimentally in shallow mantle materials at low pressures, no information is yet available on the mobility of helium in the deepest 80% of Earth's mantle. The proposed work will provide the first data on helium mobility in these deep mantle materials. <br/> The proposed research combines both experimental measurements and first-principles calculations. Experiments will be carried out at CWRU and Harvard to determine the mechanism and rate of He diffusion in periclase, as well as its solubility, over a wide range of temperature and pressure. The diffusivity of He will be determined by incremental outgassing step-heating experiments on He-saturated crystals using the noble gas mass spectrometer at Harvard. Helium diffusivity and solubility at high pressures will be determined through time series experiments in sealed noble-gas charged capsules followed by bulk He analysis of the recovered crystals. Theoretical first-principles calculations will be carried out at the University of Wisconsin to determine He diffusivity and its mechanism in both periclase and MgSiO3-perovskite. The calculations will provide a critical cross-check on the experimental data and extend the study to deep lower mantle conditions that are experimentally inaccessible. The proposed research will provide a fundamental constraint on the minimum length scale of geochemical heterogeneity that can be maintained in Earth's deep mantle. It may also provide indirect insight into the helium mobility in nuclear reactor materials, where helium embrittlement is a persistent problem, and in proposed nuclear waste disposal materials, which include perovskite-structured oxides."
0.41048,"With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF), and EPSCoR programs, Professor Jessie Carrick from Tennessee Technological University and colleagues Daniel Swartling, Jeffrey Rice, William Carroll and Xuanzhi Zhan will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broadband nitrogen-cooled cryoprobe. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The nitrogen-cooled probe will provide a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. The new instrument will have a significant and immediate impact on the research training and teaching endeavors of faculty in the departments of Chemistry as well as Chemical Engineering and an interdisciplinary Environmental Sciences Program. The presence of a reliable instrument equipped with a sample changer will allow much greater student access to a spectrometer in the teaching laboratories than an old, low-field instrument currently at this university. The PIs indicate that the instrument will be utilized by students in the sophomore organic courses, the advanced analytical laboratory, and an advanced organic spectroscopy course. Special emphasis will be directed to women and other historically underrepresented students in STEM.<br/><br/>The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesizing bis-1,2,4-triazine ligands, including conformational and subsequent complexation studies with simulated actinides for potential remediation of used nuclear fuel; (b) structurally characterizing fluorescent proteins for nerve regeneration and wound healing; (c) developing solution phase structure approaches for dynamic molecules; (d) studying conformations of arrestin proteins; (e) developing green chemistry methodology; and (f) studying thiosemicarbazone ligands as potential anti-cancer therapeutics."
0.5,"The end product of photosynthesis, sucrose, is exported from leaves to the rest of the plant where it is used as an energy source for metabolism. This distribution of sucrose is essential for plant growth and development. A major route for passage of sucrose between cells is via cytoplasmic channels called plasmodesmata (PD). Although PD have long been known to exist and to be important for sucrose transport, we still do not know how PD development and function are regulated. There is accumulating evidence that chloroplasts, the plant organelles that perform photosynthesis to generate sucrose, produce signals that can regulate PD. This project will determine how chloroplast function impacts PD to regulate sucrose transport. The results of this research will be of broad interest to plant biologists, and in the long term should also provide novel targets for genetic engineering in efforts to develop plants with fine-tuned control of carbon partitioning. This may produce plants with better carbon allocation patterns to meet increased human demands for crop production. Several high school and undergraduate students will be involved in this project, and will gain hands-on experience in conducting research. This will help the NSF meet its goal of integrating research and education. <br/><br/>Carbon partitioning in plants depends on the coordination of carbon fixation with transport. Plasmodesmata (PD) allow the passage of sugars to and from the plant vasculature for redistribution to tissues that require photoassimilates. It has long been known that plant physiology significantly impacts PD and intercellular trafficking, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. On the basis of previous work with the ise2 mutant, it is proposed that chloroplasts regulate the balance between photosynthesis and PD. ISE2 is an evolutionarily conserved nuclear gene that encodes a chloroplast RNA helicase. The objective of this study is to characterize the function of this chloroplast RNA helicase in chloroplasts and to elucidate its impacts on PD. Specific goals of this project are to: 1) elucidate the molecular function of ISE2 in the chloroplast, 2) understand how chloroplast photosynthetic output alters PD formation and intercellular trafficking, and 3) characterize other chloroplast mutants with altered PD structure and trafficking properties. The questions addressed in this proposal impact two important areas of plant cell biology. The first is the longstanding question of how intercellular flux of carbon via PD is regulated. Second is RNA processing in the chloroplast, an intriguing process that represents a crucial step in the coordination of gene expression between nuclear and organellar genomes, providing insight into the evolution of the organelle from its prokaryotic origins as an endosymbiont. A combination of biochemical and molecular biological approaches will be used to investigate ISE2's molecular function; intercellular trafficking will be monitored through the use of fluorescent molecules; and PD will be visualized by transmission electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Insight into the relationship between chloroplasts and PD will increase our understanding of how plants integrate local physiological and environmental cues into decisions that have systemic implications. The research in this proposal takes a holistic view of intercellular trafficking, and the results generated could potentially shift the paradigm from PD as passive mediators of carbon flux to PD as part of a larger strategy for integrating local, cellular physiology with whole organism responses."

The award to Hampton University has potential impact in the areas of high energy physics, homeland security, and nuclear medicine through the development of new halide-based rare-earth detectors. The results of this project will add new knowledge on the optical, structural, electronic, and scintillation properties of the proposed materials, impacting the development of efficient radiation sensors. Every year, two undergraduate students will be directly involved in the research.

0.232,"Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe, they are keys to many astrophysical processes, and they may hold the key to explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. They are known to occur in nature in three types, or ""flavors."" It has also been observed that neutrinos could switch flavors through a process known as neutrino oscillation. From such oscillation experiments, it is found that neutrinos must have a mass. This is the first known indication that there is physics beyond the very successful Standard Model of Particle Physics. Neutrino mass remains one of the most important open questions in physics and so experiments are searching for ways to determine it since with their abundance they could play an important role in the evolution of our Universe. Direct laboratory determinations based on the precise measurement of the beta spectrum have been expanding over the past 80 years due to increasingly powerful electron spectrometry techniques. In 2009, the PI proposed a new technique by which the energy spectrum of low energy electrons can be extracted. The technique, known as Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), relies on the detection and measurement of coherent radiation created from the cyclotron motion of electrons in a magnetic field.<br/><br/>Knowledge of neutrino masses has broad implications for the scientific community, particularly in the fields of nuclear physics, particle physics, and cosmology. The CRES technique, being a general spectroscopic technique for low energy electrons, has broad applicability. Examples of possible application include detection of rare radioactive isotopes for nuclear non-proliferation, Fiertz interference term measurements, low energy electron-atom scattering, and high voltage metrology. The PI wishes to target undergraduate student participation in such research toward underrepresented minorities, particularly toward members of the Native American community.<br/><br/>After three years of research and development, the Project 8 experiment has successfully demonstrated the first detection of cyclotron radiation from single electrons. With the proof of principle firmly established, this award provides continued support for the next stage of the R&D program, moving toward a neutrino mass measurement from tritium beta decay. In particular, the next phase is to make a first measurement of a tritium beta spectrum in order to determine the scalability of the technique. Such a direct measurement in the sub-eV neutrino mass range is important for cosmology, the structure of the new Standard Model, and it will illuminate a key unknown in the search for neutrino-less double beta decay."
0.363042,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.375,"Proteins carry out many different tasks that are necessary for life. The specific task performed depends on the 3-dimensional structure of the protein molecule. In nature, a protein's structure can be purposely altered through interaction with ions, like calcium, or by chemical modifications, such as adding a sugar group. Even though it is predicted that most proteins have sugars attached to them, forming so-called glycoproteins, only a small proportion of the 100,000+ protein structures studied by scientists are glycoproteins. To understand how attached sugars alter the structure of a calcium-binding protein, the effects of the attached sugars must be systematically investigated. Understanding the synergistic effects of the sugar, calcium, and protein will allow investigators to study the function of these unique protein shapes and to predict the structure of similar glycoproteins. Graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be recruited for this project. They will acquire specialized training in protein chemistry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.<br/><br/>With this award, NSF-EPSCoR and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division are funding Dr. Megan Macnaughtan from Louisiana State University to determine the synergistic effects of calcium binding and glycosylation on the structure of the mouse Notch1 Abruptex region. The structure and function of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, like those in the Notch1 Abruptex region, are regulated by highly conserved glycosylation and calcium-binding sites. The effects of high-affinity calcium-binding sites on the structure of tandem EGF repeats has been well-studied, but the synergistic and singular effects of glycosylation have not been systematically investigated. EGF repeats 26-28 of the Notch1 Abruptex region will be studied to determine the calcium dissociation constants and the structural changes upon sequential glycosylation using fluorescence spectrophotometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The high-resolution 3-dimensional structure of calcium-bound, glycosylated EGF26-28 will be determined using NMR to identify important interactions. By defining the interactions between calcium, the glycans, and the protein, new insights into the structure of other glycosylated EGF repeats and the regulation of EGF repeat function will be revealed, impacting the fields of structural biology and cellular signaling."
0.596335,"This award will allow for the establishment of a strong research and educational development program in the field of ultrafast atomic, molecular, and optical sciences in the Department of Physics at the University of Arizona. The program will study atomic and molecular response to strong transient electric fields with simultaneous use of IR and XUV pulses in attosecond precision experiments. This will involve measurement and control of electronic and nuclear dynamics in highly-excited molecules using attosecond/femtosecond resolved pump-probe experiments. Ultrashort XUV excitation provides direct access to an interesting and challenging regime, where atoms and molecules are energetically far from their ground-state configuration. Using attosecond time-resolved XUV+IR experiments, we can measure the effect of strong electric fields on excited bound-state wavepackets in atomic systems. These measurements will offer new opportunities for the control of electron dynamics on attosecond time-scales. In molecules, the XUV excitation is associated with fast inner-valence electron phenomenon, correlated two-electron processes, and strongly interdependent electronic and nuclear dynamics. The understanding of time-resolved dynamics in this regime has been very limited due to the spectroscopic difficulties in probing inherently low cross-section photo-fragmentation channels; the complexity of the potential energy surface manifold in highly-excited systems; and the paucity of efficient, tunable, femtosecond/attosecond XUV photon sources. This project aims at investigating this regime by utilizing cutting-edge research tools, such as, tailored XUV pulses, and efficient photo-fragment imaging schemes.<br/><br/>The broader aspects include the CAREER educational objectives that will increase the representation of Hispanic students in physics research; directly involve undergraduate students in ultrafast science research; and lead to the development and web-based dissemination of interactive learning programs. This training and outreach, along with the forefront research will help make our nation more competitive in the field of attosecond and femtosecond science. The educational plan targets students from an under-represented group. In collaboration with a primarily Hispanic institution (UTEP), Hispanic students will obtain hands-on experience and vital exposure in a cutting edge field of research. With the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, the educational program leads to the development of interactive learning programs in optics/AMO, along with a method for web-based publication and dissemination, in a manner that will be useful to wider community. The research spin-offs of this program will be in the form of new insights and discoveries, which will impact other related fields such as quantum optics, theoretical atomic and molecular physics, coherent control, atmospheric chemistry, chemical imaging and radiation chemistry."
0.176544,"This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating III-V Nitride piezoresistive microcantilever based neutron detector technology to fill the critical technology gap in the neutron detection area arising out of severe worldwide shortage of He-3. The translated technology has the following unique features: (i) vacuum enclosure of the microcantilever sensors, which will result in highly sensitive detection of nuclear radiation, as well as protection of the sensor from environment and unwanted radiation enhancing sensor reliability; (ii) possibility of using arrays of sensors realized through microfabrication techniques, which can offer imaging capabilities and directionality information; (iii) the usage of bimodal detection technique and two functionalization layers to perform highly efficient and unique detection of neutrons. Thus, it provides exemplary performance, cost savings and efficiency when compared to the leading competing neutron detection technology based on Boron-10 in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by using a relatively inexpensive material with unique material properties and adopting a design strategy involving the design features mentioned above, resulting in a novel neutron detector prototype. The partnership engages Savannah River National Laboratory to provide guidance in the He-detection market space and other aspects including prototype testing and technology commercialization, as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be in several tens of millions of dollars in the next eight years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this highly critical neutron detection market space.

0.339095,"Milkweeds (Asclepias) are common and ecologically important perennial plants of North American grassland and forest ecosystems. They are the only host plants of the monarch butterfly, a species of significant conservation concern. Because milkweed species diversified over a short evolutionary time span, reconstructing their evolutionary relationships is exceedingly difficult and requires examination of a large amount of data on genetic variation and powerful computational techniques. This research will contribute to the development of new methods for more accurately determining evolutionary relationships when many species have been formed in rapid succession. The results will have implications for better understanding the coevolution between milkweeds and monarch butterflies and the evolution of plant defense, as well as provide a robust evolutionary context for understanding the results of other scientific studies using milkweeds as study organisms; e.g., research on plant reproduction and genome evolution. The project will train postdoctoral fellows and graduate student in the latest phylogenetic and bioinformatics methods thereby training the next generation of phylogenetic biologists.<br/><br/>This research will demonstrate the feasibility of solving difficult phylogenetic problems at the species level in plants by employing improvements in next-generation sequencing techniques. The work combines methods for targeted sequencing of hundreds of specific regions of the nuclear genome applied to unusually large within-species sampling. The project applies nuclear gene probes developed directly from Asclepias genome and transcriptome sequences to effectively target 768 genes and substantial amounts of their non-coding flanking regions. Phylogenetically useful off-target sequences, (e.g., complete chloroplast genomes) are also obtained. By sampling 20 individuals per species, the approach will distinguish common causes of gene tree discordance: incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. An analytic workflow will be applied that incorporates simulation of incomplete lineage sorting and a combination of species tree inference methods that are effective even when introgression has occurred. Because current species tree approaches are constrained by a computational tradeoff between the number of loci and number of alleles that can simultaneously analyzed, the project will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods. The large sample of loci will also validate the recognition of species not currently accepted in Asclepias. Undergraduate and graduate student training in genomics, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics will target participants from underrepresented groups. Project outcomes will reach the broader scientific community and the general public through workshops held at scientific meetings, K-12 education modules focused on milkweed ecology and evolution, and demonstration exhibits at a public botanic garden."

The atomic elements found in stars in globular clusters retain the chemical fingerprints of the earliest generations of stars. These elements offer a glimpse into the ways that nature formed stars in the early Universe and produced the heavy elements (iron, uranium, etc.) like those found on Earth today. This investigator will collect and interpret new observational data on trace elements found in five globular clusters. These clusters were formed prior to the assembly of our galaxy. <br/><br/>Abundance variations among the heavy elements may signal another expression of the multiple populations phenomenon in globular clusters. These variations are not predicted by current models of globular cluster formation and evolution. New optical spectroscopy data collected using the M2FS spectrograph at the Magellan Telescopes will settle the issue. The investigator will perform observations that will conclusively confirm or refute previous ideas based on lower-quality spectroscopic data. If confirmed, the community will gain a new tool to guide models of globular cluster formation and evolution. If refuted, the community may refocus its efforts to develop models that fully explain the chemical and dynamical properties of globular clusters in the Milky Way.<br/><br/>This project will also result in the development of a new introductory course that explores the connections between heavy elements forged in ancient stars and the nuclear weapons that have shaped global politics over the last few generations. This course would reach a broad audience of undergraduates at the University of Michigan, including many students who are not majoring in one of the STEM disciplines. The course will introduce students to the role of science in the public arena, articulated specifically through the compelling story of how stardust from ancient supernovae became the key ingredient in the nuclear arms race.

In this model, a few ancestral species diversify rapidly to fill ecological space with a variety of new morphological and ecological strategies. Recently, hybridization among closely related species has been hypothesized to play an important role during the early stages of an adaptive radiation, but studies investigating this process in plants are currently lacking. This project will evaluate the role of hybridization in facilitating an adaptive radiation using the Andean plant genus Lachemilla (Rosaceae) as a model. Lachemilla comprises approximately 50 described species and is restricted to high elevation habitats throughout the Andes. Phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast and single-copy nuclear DNA gene sequences from multiple Lachemilla species will first be used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships. Using this evolutionary framework, researchers will then use a variety of statistical approaches to investigate the role played by hybridization in driving diversification within the lineage. This research will provide extensive training in systematics and evolutionary biology to a graduate student, and enhance international scientific collaboration with researchers in Ecuador. This project will provide training for one undergraduate student in laboratory techniques and data analysis, and also provide valuable mentoring experience for the co-PI. <br/><br/>This project will use phylogenetic methods to investigate and test the hybrid swarm origin and syngameon hypotheses for the generation of functional diversity during an adaptive radiation using the plant genus Lachemilla (Rosaceae). A robust and comprehensive phylogeny from hundreds of Lachemilla accessions using high-throughput sequencing approaches of whole chloroplast and multiple single-copy nuclear regions will be generated using Bayesian approaches. This phylogenetic framework will then be used to first test for evidence of hybridization, and then investigate whether morphological, functional, and phylogenetic diversification in the clade coincides with hybridization events. By integrating modern comparative phylogenetic measures of trait evolution with sophisticated analyses of lineage diversification rates, this research will investigate the explicit role of hybridization in the early stages of an adaptive radiation."
1.251,"Neutrino oscillations not only demonstrate that neutrinos have mass but also imply the existence of new symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Natural conjectures suggest that deeper understanding of neutrinos may provide a glimpse onto phenomena at a Planck-scale energy level, could broaden our knowledge of the fundamental forces, could shed light onto the initial creation of leptons and baryons, and can help to improve our understanding of the early evolution of the Universe. These observations motivate further studies of the properties of neutrinos including investigating if they are Majorana- or Dirac-type. Majorana-type neutrinos lead to a neutrinoless double beta decay -- the second-order weak nuclear process for which an initial state nucleus with atomic weight and number (A, Z) is transformed into a nucleus with (A, Z + 2) with the emission of only two electrons. The two electrons in the final state carry a total energy equal to the energy of the nuclear transition. This seemingly simple principle provides the main observable for detecting neutrinoless double beta decay and poses an experimental challenge in searches for such transitions.<br/><br/>This award will provide funding to continue this group's participation in the NEMO-3 data analysis and in the construction of the first SuperNEMO module (the 'Demonstrator'). The NEMO-3 data, collected at the Modane Underground Laboratory under the French-Italian Alps between 2003 and 2011, will be fully analyzed over the next couple of years. For SuperNEMO, the next three years will be a critical period for completing and commissioning the Demonstrator. This group has two new important commitments: to provide the high voltage system for all Demonstrator photomultipliers, and to coordinate the radio-purification of 82-Selenium and production of isotopic foils.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Proving or disproving that neutrinos are Majorana-type may shed light onto the early stages of the evolution of the Universe. This experiment will advance knowledge about some of the rarest phenomena in Nature. On the technical side, the group is developing a unique low background counting technique which may be applied outside of physics and be of general benefit to society. They plan to build on the UT campus an exhibit gallery illustrating the discovery, the underlying physics, and applications of natural radioactivity, cosmic rays, and related subatomic phenomena. It would 'tell a story' that would educate, entertain, fascinate to seek further information, and perhaps steer students or general audience towards the sciences."
0.622818,"Sophya Garashchuk of the University of South Carolina is supported by a CAREER award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop theoretical and computational methods that help to answer the question, when is it important to take the quantum nature of the nuclei into account when studying chemical processes? Dr. Garashchuk and her research group develop approximate quantum trajectory methods that are scalable to large molecular systems. This methodology is based on the dynamics of an ensemble of quantum trajectories representing a wavefunction. The development of the quantum trajectory framework in imaginary time used for the Boltzmann evolution and eigenstate calculation enable the direct calculation of thermal rate constants. The dominant quantum, inherently non-local, effects are incorporated into trajectory dynamics through a ""mean-field""-type approximation to the quantum force, which can be turned off to assess its importance in a chemical process.<br/><br/>Theoretical studies of reactivity in large systems contribute to the fundamental understanding of molecular systems in chemistry, physics, and biology and material science. Dr. Garashchuk also engages in many outreach programs that broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific process, attract more young people to research-oriented careers and bring more visibility and appreciation of science in a geographically underrepresented in research (EPSCoR eligible) state of South Carolina. The computer code developed in this project is made widely available to the research community.<br/><br/>The project is co-funded by the Office of Cyberinfrastructure."

Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, North Carolina Central University (NCCU) will conduct research in coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and formalize participation in the COHERENT research collaboration whose objective is to measure this type of neutrino scattering. This scattering was predicted in 1974, but has not yet been observed. Once observed, the methods and results will have an impact on research in astrophysics. This project will provide valuable physics research experience and mentorship for several minority undergraduate students at North Carolina Central University and also during their summers at Duke University. The project will bring cutting-edge research and research techniques into the NCCU classroom. In addition, the project will help North Carolina Central University build its research capacity and enhance the educational and research experiences of their undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to participate in the deployment and data acquisition of detector systems and to perform data analysis and simulations of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CENNS) measurements and associated background studies on key nuclear targets (such as Germanium) and shielding materials (including lead). The COHERENT collaboration will take advantage of recent advances in detector technology and the availability of an intense source of pulsed neutrinos available as a byproduct of the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to carry out the first CENNS investigation. The immediate COHERENT goal is to compare CENNS measurements in selected nuclei to Standard Model cross section calculations to test for neutrino non-standard interactions. In addition, the measured reaction rates have direct implications for understanding detector response and background in dark-matter experiments, and for modeling supernova processes and detection. Collaborators include Duke University faculty at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory."
1.035,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).

This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging.

0.02015,"This project will investigate how interactions among mitochondrial genes influence mitochondrial function and evolution. Mitochondria produce much of the energy used by cells, and this production depends upon precise interactions of multiple genes. Currently, interactions among mitochondrial genes have not been demonstrated, mainly because these genes are normally inherited as a single unit from the mother and such uniparental inheritance makes it difficult to study gene interactions. To get around this challenge, the researchers will study baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which inherit mitochondrial DNA from both parents. They will first generate unique combinations of mitochondrial genes from a large yeast population to evaluate how these influence energy production. Then they will sequence single mitochondrial genomes to identify the specific genes involved. The project will advance our understanding of the mechanics of mitochondrial protein interactions and how they shape evolution. Additionally, the research will be integrated into a genetics laboratory course and engage 128 undergraduate students in hands-on research.<br/><br/>Respiratory function relies on compatible interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial genes, which leads to mitochondrial-nuclear epistasis and, theoretically, interactions between mitochondrial genes (mt-mt epistasis). Natural variation in mtDNAs contributes to differences in fitness, but because mtDNAs are typically uniparentally inherited and do not recombine, it is difficult to functionally dissect individual vs. epistatic effects of mtDNA polymorphisms. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has bi-parental inheritance and recombination of mtDNAs. The natural distribution of mt-mt epistasis will be assessed by mating strains with identical nuclear genotypes but divergent mtDNAs, and the resulting strains containing mitochondrial recombinants will be functionally screened for evidence of mt-mt epistasis. Individual mitochondrial recombinant genomes will be sequenced and interacting loci mapped by comparing differences in allele pair frequencies between phenotypically distinct groups. This research will determine the role mt-mt epistasis plays in natural populations and provide information on mitochondrial recombination in yeast at the resolution of individual recombinant mtDNA haplotypes."
0.38214,"The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program project is to create reliable algorithms for the control of plasma in a fusion reactor. The approach can be generalized to systems that interact with fluids or structures and/or systems with delay. This project creates a new framework for optimal control of systems described by delayed or partial differential equations (PDEs) based on convex optimization of polynomial variables. A three-step approach is used: First, optimal control of delayed and partial-differential system is expressed as convex optimization of positive operators; Second, positive polynomials are used to parameterize the cone of positive operators; Finally, Sum-of-Squares and semi-definite programming are used to optimize the positive polynomials. The result is a sequence of tractable algorithms for direct control of distributed-parameter systems with decreasing error bounds.<br/><br/>Structural or fluid components are modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) can include plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor, blood flow around an aneurysm, or vibration in an aircraft wing. Sources of delay can include control over a network such as the Internet. Control of systems modeled by PDEs can be challenging due to its complexity. This project considers the control of nuclear fusion plasma - which has yet to experimentally sustain a positive net energy production - the resulting improvement in efficiency may have long-term implications for future worldwide energy production. The project will leverage international collaboration through NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) Global Venture Fund (GVF) co-funding and integrate with local middle and high school programs to promote energy education as well as building support and public awareness for high-energy magnetic confinement fusion and its role in the national and global energy discussion."

1.650617,"PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0605119<br/>INSTITUTION: University South Carolina Research Foundation<br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY C INTERMEDIATE ENERGY NUCLEAR SCIENCE<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Avignone, Frank T. <br/><br/>TITLE: CUORE: Phase-I Construction and Crystal Bolometer Research and Development<br/><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of experimental neutrino-less double beta decay efforts has been greatly enhanced by the observation of the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, the confirmation of oscillations of solar neutrinos by SuperKamiokande, the demonstration by the SNO experiment that the flux of 8-B neutrinos predicted by Bahcall is correct, and by the recent confirmation of the large Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein mixing angle solution of the solar-neutrino problem by the KamLAND experiment. However, these neutrino oscillation data cannot yield the mass scale of neutrinos, nor can they be used to determine that neutrinos are Majorana particles. If the mass of the electron neutrino is  0.2 eV, and neutrinos are Majorana particles, neutrino-less double beta decay is the only hope of determining the mass scale and it is the only practical experiment for determining that they are Majorana particles. Knowledge of the mass would determine what role, if any, neutrinos play as Hot Dark Matter candidates, and if they are Majorana particles, this opens the door to leptogenesis as a possible mechanism for the tiny particle over anti-particle asymmetry in the early universe that would have led to the particle dominated universe observed today.<br/><br/>Hence, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), as a neutrino-less double beta decay experiment, has significant discovery potential. This proposal is a request to support the University of South Carolina (USC) in: 1) the first phase of the construction of the 130-Te CUORE experiment; the USC group proposes to take responsibility for the production of the electronic components necessary to instrument the 988 TeO2 bolometers; and 2) an R&D program to determine the technical feasibility and cost of constructing CUORE with Te enriched to 85% in 130-Te. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project relate to development of ultralow background Ge detectors, transferred now to commercial companies. The low background technology has been used to produce an ultra low background Ge detector for the Savannah River Low-Background Counting Facility. This facility is used for US government work related to Homeland Defense and National Defense."

0.149999,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel Continuous Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (CADR) design by building and testing a prototype. This new technology has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of ultra-low temperature research. Currently, if a researcher needs to keep an experiment below 0.1K for more than a few days, there is only one viable technology: Dilution Refrigerators. These refrigerators rely on the very rare isotope He-3 (largely sourced from Tritium decay within the nuclear stockpile) and are quite expensive ($350,000 or more). The technology to be developed in Phase I promises to reduce this cost significantly by avoiding the complexity, size, infrastructure requirements, and He-3 reliance of Dilution Refrigerators. The envisioned CADR has the potential to help enable cost-effective quantum computing, the wide deployment of hyper-sensitive detectors for tracking nuclear material, the creation of quantum-information sensors critical to certain cryptographic schemes, in addition to other outcomes heretofore unknown.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is the creation of a revolutionary ultra-low temperature refrigerator. During this Phase I effort, a prototype refrigerator will be created which demonstrates the basic working principles of this new design. This prototype refrigerator will operate using a single stage of Gadolinium Gallium Garnet (GGG) as a refrigerant for continuously lifting heat from sub-Kelvin temperatures to a 3K pulse tube. This refrigerator will serve as a proof-of-concept for a two-stage refrigerator to be designed and tested in Phase II. The future two-stage refrigerator will use GGG to precool ferric ammonium alum (FAA) in order to reach 0.1 Kelvin and below. The research in this Phase I effort will feature an iterative process of subsystem characterization (heat switches, magnetic shielding, etc.), design, build and test. The Phase I effort is focused on answering the feasibility questions surrounding the engineering of this CADR while leaving 100 mK temperatures, multi-stage cooling, and deep analysis to Phase II. A successful proof of concept refrigerator to be demonstrated and characterized at the end of Phase I will move useful heat (goal of 0.5 milliwatts) from sub-Kelvin temperatures to a 3K pulse tube."
0.18012,"A new element will be investigated as a prospective candidate for a next generation optical atomic clock and for laser cooling. Atomic clocks have been instrumental in the advancement of science and technology in the twentieth century, leading to innovations such as global positioning, advance communications, and tests of fundamental particle physics. A next generation optical atomic clock would extend the capabilities of these systems and will enable a renaissance of timing applications such as enhanced security for data routing and communications, advanced earth and space time-based navigation, geophysical surveying, testing Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, and searches for variations in the fundamental constants of the universe. Laser cooling is a technique for which the mechanical action of light is used to reduce the velocity of an atom in a gas. The use of lasers to cool atoms opened up new frontiers in physics ranging from the formation of new states of matter to enabling novel nanotechnologies. The extension of laser cooling to a new atomic species will enable the creation of novel ultracold atomic systems with unique properties and dynamics. The goal of this project is to investigate the atomic physics properties and implement laser cooling of atomic gadolinium for its potential use as an optical frequency standard and as a step to create new research avenues in atomic physics cross-fertilized with condensed matter physics. More specifically, these experiments will use lasers as a probe to determine the influence of external perturbations that limits its accuracy as an atomic clock. In addition, the spectral features of gadolinium will be characterized as a diagnostic tool to determine its cooling limits. This specific milestone will enable a gadolinium optical clock of greater accuracy and the realization of exotic ultracold quantum physics systems. This research program will support and train undergraduate and graduate students to become the next generation of scientists and engineers for fundamental and applied research in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. <br/><br/><br/>This project is an experimental research program directed towards investigating collisional and spectroscopic properties of atomic gadolinium (Gd). Gd is a novel class of atom that has an exotic electronic configuration and large ground state magnetic moment, which allows it to have submerged shell optical clock transitions, ultracold collisions having ground state angular momentum, and exotic quantum gas phases and phenomenon dominated by dipole-dipole forces. In particular, the collision studies involve measurements of collision quenching cross sections, and pressure broadening and shifts of the atomic states and line shapes of the optical clock and laser cooling transitions inside a Gd vapor cell. The objective is to characterize the collision sensitivity of these atomic transitions to give insight into the combined action of electron screening and configurational interactions. In addition, the radiative lifetimes, hyperfine structure, and isotope shifts of identified intercombination laser cooling transitions will be determined using laser induce fluorescence spectroscopy with an atomic beam. The determination of these spectroscopic properties are necessary for implementing narrow-line laser cooling for both bosonic and fermonic isotopes of gadolinium. Narrow-line laser cooling is essential for achieving quantum degeneracy with gadolinium, since its large ground state magnetic moment prevents evaporative cooling in a magnetic trap. In addition, laser cooling and trapping using electric-dipole transitions will be executed to create a magneto-optical trap of gadolinium as a first step towards performing precision measurements, investigating ultracold collision, and for studying atomic dipolar physics.<br/><br/>The experimental program will have three categories of broader impacts. First, forbidden transitions of rare earth elements are virtually unexplored. These atomic resonances are well suited as potential candidates for next generation frequency standards, with Q-factors nearly four orders of magnitude larger than current neutral atom clock lines, a suppression of black-body radiations shifts by exponents in the fine structure constant, and reduced sensitivity to collision. Moreover, for Standard Model Physics, these transitions have enhanced sensitivities to variations in the fine structure constant. Second, a laser cooled and trapped gas of gadolinium will have many applications: For nuclear physics, astrophysics, and biomedicine, laser cooled Gd will allow for economizing nuclear fuel consumption, ultrasensitive isotope trace analysis of the element for cosmo-chemical studies and biomedical sample testing respectively. Also with respect to nanostructure fabrication, an ultracold gas of Gd can be used for controlled doping or nanoscale milling to create novel magnetic devices. Third, graduate and undergraduate students who will help perform the proposed experiments will be trained. A goal of this project is to attract and retain more students in Atomic Molecular and Optical physics through the involvement of university students in the proposed experiments. This is augmented by the fact that the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a major research institution in the geographical region with an annual enrollment of nearly 18,000 students, and the research project involves the extensive use of lasers that is ideal for capturing a student's imagination. An additional goal is to recruit underrepresented minorities, which represents 25 percent of UAB's student population. Underrepresented minorities represent a large untapped wealth of potential for becoming contributors in the fields of science and engineering. To help address this matter a major plan is to involve minority graduate, undergraduate, and high school students via existing UAB outreach and REU programs to participate in research projects in the Simien Spectroscopy and Laser Cooling group. Furthermore, special outreach activities will be done with the aim to get K - 12 students interested in science and engineering by performing various physics, chemistry, and material science demonstration at local schools in the region."
0.018026,"Accurate delimitations and estimates of species diversity are critical aspects for many areas of biology, including biogeography, ecology, and conservation. This research focuses on improving our understanding of species diversity in the Mediterranean Basin - one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world. As threats to biodiversity mount, due mainly to climate change and human pressure, accurate assessments are increasingly important for conservation efforts. To study fine-scale evolution and biogeographic patterns and processes, the researchers have identified a poorly understood group of bellflowers (the Campanula erinus species complex) that can serve as a model for understanding the drivers of evolution in this highly diverse area. This project will focus specifically on inferring the evolutionary history and providing an accurate assessment of species diversity in this group of plants. Results will have important implications for understanding the origins of Mediterranean biodiversity, designing successful conservation efforts, and anticipating possible responses to future climate change.<br/><br/>The researchers will employ a next-generation sequencing approach, involving targeted enrichment of numerous nuclear loci across populations of both the widespread Campanula erinus and the narrow endemic, Campanula creutzburgii. Though sequencing will focus on the Campanula erinus species complex, the nuclear probe set will be designed such that it will be useful across the Campanulaceae (more than 2400 taxa). This targeted sequencing technique, in conjunction with morphological data, and recent coalescent and model-based methods, will serve as a model for future studies integrating traditional systematic and genome-level data for evaluating species boundaries and detecting cryptic speciation in vascular plants. The probe set developed during the course of this study will be made available to the scientific community, facilitating future evolutionary studies within the family. Studying the Campanula erinus complex in a phylogenetic and biogeographic framework will illuminate the drivers of diversification and persistence of species and allow the researchers to relate these mechanisms to factors such as ecology, geologic history, and climatic fluctuations. Three hypotheses will be tested regarding these taxa: i) Cryptic taxonomic diversity is present within the Campanula erinus aggregate; ii) Historical sea level changes contributed to allopatric speciation; iii) Polyploidy (genome duplication) has been an important historical factor in this group and polyploids may represent species distinct from their diploid progenitors. An understanding of these evolutionary processes will be especially critical in this biodiversity hotspot, where conservation efforts are expected to be most challenging but likely give the highest payoff."
0.15,"In the late 1800s, flash photography enabled the motion of macroscopic objects to be slowed to the point where the true order of events could be extracted. Nearly a century later, femtosecond pulses (1 femtosecond is one millionth of one billionth of a second) enabled the motions of atoms to be frozen during the formation and breakup of molecules, resulting in an improved microscopic picture of chemistry. The advent of attosecond pulses, a million times shorter, allows the motion of the tiniest building block of matter, the electron, to be stopped in its tracks. Professors Chang, of the University of Central Florida, and Hill, of the University of Maryland, together with their students, use attosecond laser pulses to study electronic charge dynamics on timescales commensurate with its indigenous motion in atomic and molecular systems. Charge migration, as it is known, is central to a variety of important processes such as photosynthesis, radiation damage in biomolecules and photovoltaics used in solar panels. This collaborative project is providing insight into the collective and interactive motion of electrons that are ubiquitous in atoms, molecules and solids. An improved understanding of charge migration will have broad application from controlling the flow of energy within a molecule to tailoring the performance of materials to specific needs.<br/><br/>Photoinduced charge separation in molecules is the first step in many chemical processes and central to our understanding of electron correlation and the energy exchange between electronic and nuclear motion responsible for catalysis, photosynthesis, photovoltaics and radiation damage in biomolecules. Comprehensive numerical simulations of complex molecules predict that when an electron is 'suddenly' removed from one end of a chain molecule, such as a small peptide, the hole can move to the other end of the molecule in less than 10 fs, before the electron-nuclear coupling takes place. Intense, isolated attosecond pulses are required to study this naturally-occurring charge migration. Professors Chang and Hill, in a collaborative project between the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the University of Maryland (UMD), exploit the attosecond source at UCF to investigate charge migration in multi-electron atoms (He) and multi-atom molecules (SO2) via attosecond pump - attosecond probe experiments. The pump pulse initiates rapid excitation (in the absence of nuclear motion in the molecular case) while the probe pulse monitors the ensuing charge migration. Two probe techniques are used to 'watch' the charge migration: transient absorption and photoelectron angular distribution. In distinction with previous attosecond studies, where charge migration was investigated in the presence of a strong external infrared field, the UCF-UMD study is probing charge migration subsequent to excitation but in the absence of any external perturbation. As a consequence, this project is providing a clearer understanding of charge separation, energy flow and electron-nuclear charge coupling, which, as stated above, are relevant to a variety of processes associated with chemical reactions, dynamics in condensed matter systems and biological phenomena. A secondary goal of this project is the development of general experimental tools that can be transferred to more complicated systems, such as ABCU (1-azabicyclo [3.3.3] undecane), for which theoretical predictions exist and the excitation spectra fall near those of the model systems of this study."
0.19992,"The PI will develop novel algorithms that can be used for the simulation of flow through porous media in real-world reservoir models. The simulation of flow in porous media finds applications in a number of areas, such as water management, oil and gas recovery, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, and nuclear waste disposal, to name a few. The underlying mathematical models and efficient numerical simulation is challenging due to several aspects. The reservoirs are typically very large, so the discretized mathematical model leads to systems of equations with hundreds of millions of unknowns, they have irregular structure, which complicates the model geometry, and they consist of materials that significantly differ in geological properties, which translates in the model to jumps in coefficients over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the geological formations quite often also contain fractures that alter the effective permeabilities, and therefore need to be be accurately incorporated into the numerical model. For example, the flow of water in granite rock, which represents one of the suitable sites for nuclear waste deposit, is conducted by the complex system of vugs, cavities and fractures with various topology and sizes. Alternatively, the fractures might result from the engineering activities, for example hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking) used for the extraction of natural gas.<br/><br/>The PI will develop novel algorithms for solving saddle-point linear systems combining numerical upscaling techniques with parallel, domain decomposition iterative solvers. There are many aspects of multiscale and domain decomposition methods that are quite well understood, but the major drawback of current methodologies is that they do not take full advantage of their potential by using the multiscale phenomena in the design of the solvers, which results in their inefficiency. Multiscale methods also frequently consist in fact only of two scales, whereas in a porous medium there are typically many scales. At the same time, advances in multicore architectures, networking, high end computers, and large data stores, are ushering in a new era of high performance parallel and distributed simulations. Naturally, with these new capabilities come new challenges in computing and system modeling. The goal of this project is to open new avenues to tackle these issues. In particular, the PI will develop multiscale methods that allows for a multiple of scales, and uses the upscaling algorithm to build a multilevel preconditioner for the iterative solver. The components of the method are thus recycled, which significantly decreases the computational cost. Moreover, this approach can be applied recursively and thus naturally offers a multilevel multiscale potential, unlike many traditional multiscale approaches that consist in fact of only two scales. It is expected that understanding of the issues related to design of multiscale and multilevel methods for extremely large problems will ultimately contribute to development of the next generation of parallel iterative solvers suitable for implementation on future exascale supercomputers."
0.38,"Quantum spins associated with defects in diamond (Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers) can be used to sense magnetic fields with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution. These novel sensors could elucidate the structure and dynamics of materials and biomolecules at the nano-scale and ambient conditions. A critical ingredient to the success of these sensors is the understanding of their environment (composed of other diamond spin defects) that usually spoil their properties. The focus of this project is not only to understand the interaction of Nitrogen-Vacancy centers with their spin environment, but also to turn these spins into a resource. This goal will be accomplished by studying the environmental spin properties and dynamics and by developing control techniques to manipulate and measuring them. In turns, a better understanding of the spin system and novel control techniques will yield improved quantum devices for sensing and bio-imaging. In addition, the ability to explore spin dynamics at the nano-scale, a possibility opened by the use of Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, will advance the knowledge of this complex, many-body non-equilibrium quantum phenomenon and have impact in broader disciplines, including quantum computation and MRI. This project will support the training of graduate student researchers in an exciting and multidisciplinary research field. <br/><br/>This research program will explore fundamental physics and potential applications of spin polarization at the nanoscale, with a synergistic interplay between theory and experiment. The project exploits the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a seed and sensor of local spin polarization in the surrounding electronic and nuclear spin environment. The goals are to first achieve efficient polarization buildup via optical cooling of the NV center and its thermal contact with the spin bath; and second, to investigate the subsequent dynamics (polarization transport) in the mesoscopic spin environment. Thanks to high spatial resolution of NV detection and to novel material engineering techniques, these phenomena on single-spin systems, will be able to be studied at the nano-meter scale. The intellectual merit of the program lies in elucidating, via experiments and theoretical models, the phenomenon of spin diffusion, investigating scales not previously accessible to conventional magnetic resonance techniques. Spin diffusion is a complex quantum many-body process, which underlies, for example, decoherence in magnetic resonance experiments as well as dynamic polarization. In addition, by using engineered materials, how to promote coherent spin transport between distant NV centers, mediated by a quasi-one dimensional bath of electronic spins, will be studied. These studies will have a broader impact in different disciplines, from quantum computation and metrology, to protein sensing via dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Electronic spins in diamond can be used as spin wires to transfer quantum information between quantum registers located at the NV centers. A polarized spin bath can be used to improve quantum metrology via NV centers, by achieving longer coherence time and Heisenberg-limited sensitivity via the creation of an entangled state. Novel insight into spin diffusion -especially at the spin diffusion barrier- would lead to improved strategies for DNP, a popular technique in protein structure determination with NMR. Hyper-polarized nano-diamonds could themselves be used as polarizing agents, dissolved in bio-samples of interest for improved sensitivity."
0.357968,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The determination of phase diagrams, the underlying thermodynamics for designing new materials is a long and arduous process, but it is necessary to provide the basic scientific knowledge upon which new electronic and structural ceramics are based. This research is focused on how to accelerate and improve the gathering of such information, thereby introducing new methodology which can be applied to technologically-relevant systems. The approach taken in this research is to make in situ measurements at temperatures up to 4,000 F in air, using high intensity, rapid X-ray synchrotron measurements coupled with accurate data analysis. It is estimated that more scientific information can be obtained in one-fifth of the time currently taken to determine a phase diagram, with significantly more crystallographic information than what is usually obtained. A doctoral student and several undergraduate students are engaged in the research. As well, the PI participates in a variety of activities to promote science and engineering to middle and high school students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research aims to demonstrate a new, efficient and highly accurate method to determine ternary phase diagrams, using rapid, in situ, in air synchrotron instrumentation, coupled with accurate, quantitative data analysis by the Rietveld method. This work aims to revolutionize the slow, ex situ methods of collecting data and reduce the process five-fold. In addition, thermal expansion coefficients and crystal structures will be analyzed for any new phases discovered in the ternary phase diagram. The hafnia-titania-tantala ternary was selected as the model system. The ternary system is largely unexplored, but even the elements are technologically interesting. For example, tantala is a promising candidate next generation material for application in a wide range of microelectronics and integrated micro-technologies. Its dielectric constant is six times that of silica. Tantala compounds have applications as dielectric layers for storage capacitors in dynamic random access memories (DRAMS) in computers, gate oxides in field effect transistors, insulating layers in thin film electroluminescent devices, sensor layers in biological and chemical sensors, anti-reflection coatings for silicon solar cells, charge-coupled devices and corrosion resistant materials. Hafnium is a good absorber of neutrons and is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors and hafnium tantalate is of interest for structural nuclear applications. Hafnia is also used as an ultra-high temperature structural and thermally insulating material. This work is timely because current research into the next generation of electronic devices is based on doped, amorphous tantala, and the current knowledge of metastable and stable phases in crystalline tantala is unknown, even though its crystalline dielectric properties are significantly superior to its amorphous properties. An additional strategic benefit is the training of a doctoral student in this cutting-edge research technique. As well, undergraduate students are engaged in the research by helping to make samples for the synchrotron experiments and assisting at the around-the-clock beam line experiments. The PI participates in a variety of activities to promote science and engineering to middle and high school students (e.g., Project Lead the Way for grade school and high school teachers, and GAMES (engineering experiences for girls)."
0.44861,"This project includes two programs of research that explore issues in string theory and classical and quantum gravity with close connections to other areas of physics,especially quantum information theory and particle and nuclear physics:<br/><br/>a) A study of the thermal and statistical physics of holographic systems, and quantum gravity more generally, through the lens of quantum information theory; adressing aspects of the deconfinement phase transition and of entanglement entropy, and fluctuation-dissipation ratios, in time-dependent systems. These issues are important for understanding the process of thermalization in strongly-coupled media such as the quark-gluon plasma.<br/><br/>b) Continuing the development of practical, general methods for numerically solving the elliptic Einstein equation to find static, stationary, and Euclidean metrics for higher-dimensional black holes and compactification spaces. Such solutions play an important role in both formal and phenomenogical aspects of string theory, in related mathematical issues, and in holographic models of condensed-matter, fluid, and nuclear physics.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Undergraduate research is an integral part of both research programs. Three outreach, mentoring, and physics education activities are also included: TheoryNet is an NSF-funded program in which high-energy physicists visit high-school science classrooms. The PI is participating, and proposes to include postdocs and graduate students in addition to professors. The Brandeis Science Posse Program is a leadership program for science-oriented undergraduates from underprivileged backgrounds, which uses focused training and mentoring strategies. The PI will contribute to both the training and the mentoring aspects. The PI plans to adapt teaching strategies based on interaction and peer instruction to the graduate level, develop assessment tools, and perform a controlled experiment comparing the new methods to conventional lecture-based ones in a graduate quantum-mechanics course."
0.645029,"Title: Investigation of RNA-processing protein dynamics with simultaneous high-resolution optical traps and single-molecule fluorescence<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will develop optical methods that will enable direct observation in real-time of the activity of protein machines that are involved in processing RNA. RNA is one of the essential carriers of cell information, and its production and degradation are tightly controlled by RNA protein interactions associated with protein machines. The overall goal of this project is to investigate how both the cooperation and competition between different molecular machines lead to the careful regulation of information in the cell. The techniques developed in this project will apply beyond the protein machines involved in RNA processing to include a broad assortment of complex protein systems. This project will leverage optical methods development and the strong art and science connection at Michigan State University to develop an education and outreach program centered on hands-on interactions with biophysical science at the individual cell and RNA molecule level. The PI will create a video game lab experience aimed at students and the public.<br/><br/>This project will investigate RNA-processing protein dynamics of single proteins and larger protein machine assemblies by developing and applying high-resolution, multi-modal single molecule techniques. Specifically, the PI will investigate the yeast nuclear RNA helicase Mtr4p and the associated TRAMP protein complex. Mtr4p and TRAMP have emerged as key players in nuclear RNA surveillance and processing in part via precise modification of RNA for degradation by the exosome. How these machines coordinate or compete to achieve function is controversial in large part due to their highly dynamic, multi-degree of freedom interactions on the scale of only 5-10 nucleotides of RNA. The PI will address the fundamental questions regarding how Mtr4p and TRAMP function using single-molecule and high resolution optical tweezers and fluorescence. Advanced techniques combining high-resolution optical trapping and multi-color fluorescence will apply broadly across all biophysical molecular dynamics investigations towards the emerging need for tools to investigate protein-nucleic acid interactions beyond the individual molecule scale towards multi-protein, multi-degree of freedom complex systems."
0.45,"In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Terry Gullion of West Virginia University and his undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be supported to develop new solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for measuring dipolar coupling between nuclei with spin = 1/2 and quadrupolar nuclei. Careful measurement of the coupling between nuclei can yield accurate information on the distance between atoms in chemical materials. Professor Gullion will do this through development of novel sample spinning methods in conjunction with the design and construction of new kinds of probes.<br/><br/>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an important physicochemical method that gives precise chemical and structural information. The methods that Prof. Gullion and his student researchers will develop will enable scientists to measure inter-nuclear distances between nuclei that are difficult to deal with, experimentally. The work has the potential to open up new vistas in biological and materials science where the kind of information that can be obtained from these types of experiments is critical in order to relate structure with function. The undergraduate and graduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in building hardware for NMR experiments. As part of this work, Prof. Gullion will also conduct workshops on NMR hardware (transmission line probe) construction for members of the scientific community."
1.3,"Technical Abstract<br/>The development of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) console is essential to carry out the scientific program for which the Series Hybrid magnet at the NHMFL was funded. The proposed console together with the new high homogeneity magnet will increase the available field for high-homogeneity NMR from 23 to 36 T and provide important scientific opportunities. For the first time, scientists will be able to obtain chemically resolved spectra of strongly broadened isotopes. These quadrupolar nuclei, which comprise most of the periodic table and which are important for catalysts, porous materials, batteries and fuel cells, are sensitive to the molecular electric field but are impractical to study by lower field NMR due to their extreme line broadening. In addition, more than 25% of all biological macromolecules contain metals. These nuclei will also be newly accessible to NMR. The quadrupolar species 17^O and 14^N are important sites of functional activity, and will be directly observable at 36 T. The console will also facilitate development of new techniques for 1H NMR analysis of solid materials, in which the resonance lines are broadened by large spin interactions. By combining very high field and very fast sample spinning, 1H solid state NMR spectroscopy promises to become a very sensitive tool with adequate spectral resolution for scientific challenges, ranging from functionalized silicate surfaces to macromolecular studies. The user facility, providing high quality spectroscopy at up to 36 T, will allow the United States to stay at the forefront of solid state magnetic resonance for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/>Analysis of the weak magnetic signals from hydrogen led to the revolution in medicine that we know as MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Past developments in MRI and its first cousin nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which uses the same signals for chemical analysis, have been significant enough to garner four Nobel prizes. And yet, of all the elements, only a handful can be observed in conventional MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers. Other elements, including most of those important to science and medicine, produce only poorly resolved signals in the magnets typically available in laboratories. The proposed NMR/MRI scanner, together with a strong new NSF-supported magnet already under construction, will greatly extend the range of elements that can be studied by NMR to include most of the periodic table. Analyzing the chemical configuration of these elements has the potential to improve many areas of life, such as the development of batteries and fuel cells, and of new catalysts. The spectrometer is essential to carry out the scientific program of the NSF-funded series hybrid magnet, a new powered research magnet that uses less energy, and has a more uniform and constant field than previous powered magnets. The innovative magnet and NMR spectrometer will become part of the Mag Lab's user program, allowing the U.S. to stay at the forefront of magnetic resonance research for the foreseeable future."
0.12,"This grant supports the theoretical study of an electrical discharge phenomenon, called multipactor, that occurs in a broad range of microwave devices. Multipactor is a pernicious electrical discharge that can damage or destroy accelerator structures and microwave components and related electronics, such as antennas, satellite payloads, or radar systems. Despite decades of study, especially in connection with rf systems for particle accelerators, it remains a problem, and no consistent way has been found to eliminate it. The improved understanding anticipated from this work will enable more compact and higher-gradient particle accelerators. Many accelerator applications stand to benefit from this, such as compact medical accelerators, accelerator-based neutron and light sources used for basic research, and accelerator-based nuclear energy generation and transmutation of nuclear waste. Space and satellite communications will further benefit from this study. The grant will support one graduate student, and will contribute to the literature, course material, and further educational outreach.<br/><br/>The objective is to analyze multipactor in multicarrier systems using a novel multipactor theory based on techniques from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Multipactor in the presence of multiple carrier rf signals (i.e. multiple rf frequencies) is an especially challenging problem that has almost no theoretical studies. The new approach aims to identify multipacting region boundaries and stability by globally analyzing the structure of dynamical space. The theoretical results will be tested against computer simulations using a particle-in-cell code, and against experiments conducted by our collaborators at ValSpace Consortium in Valencia, Spain."
0.45,"In the late 1800s, flash photography enabled the motion of macroscopic objects to be slowed to the point where the true order of events could be extracted. Nearly a century later, femtosecond pulses (1 femtosecond is one millionth of one billionth of a second) enabled the motions of atoms to be frozen during the formation and breakup of molecules, resulting in an improved microscopic picture of chemistry. The advent of attosecond pulses, a million times shorter, allows the motion of the tiniest building block of matter, the electron, to be stopped in its tracks. Professors Chang, of the University of Central Florida, and Hill, of the University of Maryland, together with their students, use attosecond laser pulses to study electronic charge dynamics on timescales commensurate with its indigenous motion in atomic and molecular systems. Charge migration, as it is known, is central to a variety of important processes such as photosynthesis, radiation damage in biomolecules and photovoltaics used in solar panels. This collaborative project is providing insight into the collective and interactive motion of electrons that are ubiquitous in atoms, molecules and solids. An improved understanding of charge migration will have broad application from controlling the flow of energy within a molecule to tailoring the performance of materials to specific needs.<br/><br/>Photoinduced charge separation in molecules is the first step in many chemical processes and central to our understanding of electron correlation and the energy exchange between electronic and nuclear motion responsible for catalysis, photosynthesis, photovoltaics and radiation damage in biomolecules. Comprehensive numerical simulations of complex molecules predict that when an electron is ?suddenly? removed from one end of a chain molecule, such as a small peptide, the hole can move to the other end of the molecule in less than 10 fs, before the electron-nuclear coupling takes place. Intense, isolated attosecond pulses are required to study this naturally-occurring charge migration. Professors Chang and Hill, in a collaborative project between the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the University of Maryland (UMD), exploit the attosecond source at UCF to investigate charge migration in multi-electron atoms (He) and multi-atom molecules (SO2) via attosecond pump - attosecond probe experiments. The pump pulse initiates rapid excitation (in the absence of nuclear motion in the molecular case) while the probe pulse monitors the ensuing charge migration. Two probe techniques are used to ?watch? the charge migration: transient absorption and photoelectron angular distribution. In distinction with previous attosecond studies, where charge migration was investigated in the presence of a strong external infrared field, the UCF-UMD study is probing charge migration subsequent to excitation but in the absence of any external perturbation. As a consequence, this project is providing a clearer understanding of charge separation, energy flow and electron-nuclear charge coupling, which, as stated above, are relevant to a variety of processes associated with chemical reactions, dynamics in condensed matter systems and biological phenomena. A secondary goal of this project is the development of general experimental tools that can be transferred to more complicated systems, such as ABCU (1-azabicyclo [3.3.3] undecane), for which theoretical predictions exist and the excitation spectra fall near those of the model systems of this study."
0.306817,"While the best-known application for particle accelerators is associated with high-energy physics, other applications such as cancer treatment and materials processing are becoming increasingly important. Since the pioneering accelerators of the 1930s the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated, known as the energy frontier, has increased many orders of magnitude. The intensity frontier, which refers to the number of particles that can be simultaneously accelerated, has progressed much more slowly, despite the importance of a number of applications that require an increased particle flux. A major limitation to accelerating more intense beams is the inherently nonlinear behavior that becomes relevant when particle beam currents are increased.<br/><br/>It is known that linear focusing forces can stably transport a charged particle beam. This has led to a strong reliance on linear transport systems, albeit with weak nonlinear elements to correct for various unavoidable beam nonlinearities. Recent theoretical work has resulted in a fundamental rethinking of the conventional wisdom, which considered nonlinear elements as inherently problematic, and opened the possibility of a significant increase in the intensity frontier.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>This award will support the use of the unique capabilities of the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) to experimentally explore, in concert with simulation, a practical demonstration of using a strongly nonlinear lattice to stably transport intense beams. The research program will exploit the UMER apparatus to fill the gap between theoretical conjecture and practical realization. This will be accomplished by examining the many deviations from the simplifying assumptions necessary in a tractable analytic treatment, which are inevitable in a real experiment. In addition to the direct benefit of facilitating stable operation of accelerators at new intensity levels, the fundamental demonstration that strong nonlinearities can be beneficial, when weaker nonlinearities degrade performance, could be an important intellectual contribution to accelerator physics.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Operating accelerators at higher intensity levels will have a substantial impact to areas such as materials processing, accelerator based nuclear energy generation and transmutation of nuclear waste, as well as high-energy physics. In addition to the direct research effort, this program will carry out workforce training in accelerator-related careers, educating the next generation of accelerator scientists. The outreach program carried out by the PI also creates research opportunities for both local high school students and undergraduates from across the country."
0.3,"Learning requires the conversion of transient experiences into long-lasting changes in neural circuitry. Animal behavior triggers changes in gene expression in small populations of neurons and behaviorally induced genes regulate synapses and neuronal morphology. Yet, it is unclear if changes in gene expression are the cause of behavioral plasticity, or the consequence. This project will develop a new genre of fluorescent reporters that enable the visualization and manipulation of endogenous transcription factors in individual neurons, in real time, and within the brain of behaving animals. During the award period, candidate reporters will be made that recognize six different transcription factors. These reporters will have widespread utility for investigating the molecular mechanisms that support learning in vivo and analysis of populations of neurons that are active during a learning paradigm. The development of these reporters includes ongoing training of undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate scientists. Student training is optimized with guidance from the CREATE STEM Success Initiative on the UCSD campus. <br/><br/>Inducible transcription factors (ITFs) translate signals that last milliseconds or seconds into changes in cellular function that may persist for hours, days, or longer. This project will develop genetically encoded transcription factor reporters (GETFaRs) that are designed to visualize or manipulate an ITF. GETFaRs are based on molecular scaffolds, engineered through a process of synthetic affinity maturation of camelid nanobodies (Nbs) which bind the endogenous ITF. The Nb protein will be fused to a fluorophore or DNA modifying enzyme, allowing users to visualize or manipulate endogenous transcription factors. A degradation signal (degron) will be incorporated into the Nb near the ITF binding site. Consequently, GETFaRs will be constitutively expressed and rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm. When the ITF is expressed, the GETFaR-ITF interaction will mask the degron, stabilizing the complex. The ITF's nuclear localization signal will translocate the complex into the nucleus, resulting in stabilized GETFaRs that accumulate in the nucleus and stoichiometrically reflect ITF expression. Candidate GETFaRs will be validated in vitro using standard biochemical and imaging techniques and in vivo using two photon imaging of neurons in head fixed mice. Optimal GETFaRs will enable research that 1) monitors or manipulates transcriptional states during learning, 2) studies the emergence of ensembles of co-active neurons within a circuit, 3) probes the dynamics of chromatin and nuclear organization, and 4) analyzes the genome of defined populations of neurons responding to complex, natural stimuli."
0.12,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Peter W. Graham at Stanford University.<br/><br/>The Standard Model of Particle Physics has been tremendously successful, yet leaves many questions unanswered. Data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has begun to reveal the physics of the TeV scale but there is much still to be discovered, including the nature of dark matter and the resolution of the hierarchy problem. Professor Graham will calculate the consequences of recent LHC results for well-motivated theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry. It is anticipated that this project will lead to the discovery of new types of experimental signals that can be probed at the LHC, including different types of displaced vertices and fractionally charged particles. Additionally, Professor Graham will design a new type of dark-matter detector. While a large number of experiments are searching for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter, it is very difficult to search for the equally well-motivated axion dark matter, and indeed most of the allowed parameter space for axion dark matter remains unreachable by current experiments. Professor Graham will propose new signals of axions and axion-like particles, including a time-oscillating nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM), and will design a detector based on nuclear magnetic resonance technology to search for this oscillating EDM. <br/><br/>This project will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Graham will be actively involved in science education, including designing curricula and courses for undergraduate and graduate students. He will also have significant involvement with K-12 physics education. Professor Graham has developed strong connections with several local public elementary schools and will work actively on promoting awareness and understanding of modern topics in physics research. This includes directly educating the students and teachers, running labs in the classroom, and giving tours of modern physics laboratories. Professor Graham will also work actively with graduate students and postdocs on research, training them to become theoretical particle physicists. He will also continue to make connections with other subfields of physics, including astrophysics, atomic physics, and condensed-matter physics, bringing closer collaboration amongst these different fields."

These results have broad implications for critical areas such as carbon cycling, sustainability, and remediation of pollutants. Undergraduate students, some of whom are underrepresented, are recruited and mentored to participate in this project through programs such as the Sloan Center for Exemplary Mentoring and the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program. <br/><br/>The studies focus on validating nanoparticle nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods as an important and valuable tool for investigating complex mixtures of environmental relevance. The toolbox includes NMR methods such as solid state NMR, high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS), and pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR. The project demonstrates the utility of the nanoparticle NMR toolbox for studying environmental interfaces of engineered nanomaterials and natural colloids and establishes the use of nanoparticle-enabled NMR spectroscopy to selectively detect species in complex mixtures. The nanoparticle NMR toolbox is developed to elucidate molecular level details and to improve selectivity for studies of the interactions of complex mixtures, such as dissolved organic matter (DOM), with nanomaterials. The information obtained from the NMR toolbox may be used to predict the fate and transport of nanoparticles in natural systems and to engineer nanomaterials with desired properties. Further impact of this work is in developing an exhibit on environmental water research for the University of Iowa Mobile Museum and for Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics (STEM) career outreach including internships for high school students.

At present, Penning trap mass spectrometers for rare isotopes employ a time-of-flight ion cyclotron resonance (TOF-ICR) detection scheme which is universal but typically requires at minimum rate of rare isotope ions of at least a few ions per hour. In order to overcome this sensitivity limit the group will develop, build, and install a dedicated Single Ion Penning Trap Spectrometer (SIPT) mass spectrometer using a 6 Tesla magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid and employing the narrowband Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) method. The technique will be optimized for the study of very rare isotopes provided only at very low rates, one per day or week, a rate that prohibits the use of the TOF-ICR technique. The narrowband FT-ICR method uses a tuned, superconducting circuit to amplify the signal generated by a single charged particle on the electrodes of the Penning trap as it moves around inside the trap. By performing a Fourier analysis on the amplified signal, the cyclotron frequency can be determined. As narrowband FT-ICR is not as universal as TOF-ICR, it is best used on candidates with extremely low delivery rates and of great scientific interest.<br/><br/>The proposed SIPT mass spectrometer will have a broad significance and importance by improving our ability to determine the mass of rare isotopes with unusual ratios of the number of neutrons and protons, much different from those found in stable isotopes, as they exist on Earth. The determination of the masses of such exotic and often very short-lived rare isotopes is of utmost importance since it provides direct information on how tightly the neutrons and protons are bound in the atomic nucleus. Masses of rare isotopes serve as input data in a variety of fields of science, such as nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. For example, rare isotopes are produced in abundance in stellar environments and play a key role in the star's evolution but the production on earth in rare isotope beam facilities is very challenging, and for many important isotopes the beam rates are very low. SIPT's highly sensitive technique will be capable of making a mass measurement with only a single rare isotope ion, pushing the frontier of precision mass measurements of rare isotopes to more exotic isotopes. The development of this technology will also be of benefit for future use at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). We believe that the interdisciplinary nature of the SIPT project is well suited for attracting and educating students from underrepresented groups, resulting in a stronger research program and greater cultural awareness for everyone involved."
0.211192,"This award will support a multifaceted theoretical study of the mergers of various types of compact objects such as neutron stars. Understanding the full sequence of events in these mergers is a great interdisciplinary challenge of high current interest. The work will model binary formation and gravitational wave-driven inspiral; the hydrodynamics of mergers; the viscous, thermal and nuclear evolution of the post merger remnant; the general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics of the collapse to neutron stars and black holes (with its associated gravitational wave signals); and the nuclear and radiation hydrodynamics of the unbound ejecta that produces observable electromagnetic (light, radio wave, etc.) signals. <br/><br/>A major motivation is to model both gravity wave and electromagnetic signatures from these mergers. The two types of signatures provide important information about different regions of the sources. Gravitational waves will determine the 'engine' of the sources, their masses, spins, and inclinations. The electromagnetic signals will provide the precise locations, compositions, and their relation to the rest of astrophysics (nucleosynthesis, pulsars, magnetars, transients, Type Ia supernovae, formation rates and progenitors). <br/><br/>The project will contribute to the training of graduate students and in regular student exchanges between the participating institutions. Members of the research team will continue their efforts to give non-technical lectures for the public, high schools and undergraduate institutions, and consult on curricula, films, TV and radio. The results of this research, on topics that tend to generate broad interest (stellar collisions, explosions, collapse to black holes, gravitational waves in space-time), will be incorporated into these activities. The team will also make the results from this study widely available to the astrophysics community."
0.526059,"Gaining a quantitative description of the nature of strongly bound systems is of great importance for our understanding of the fundamental structure and origin of matter. Revealing the inner structure of the core of the atom that contains the protons and neutrons and understanding the dynamics that bind these most basic elements of nuclear physics is an essential part to advance this knowledge. This project is aimed at conducting leading-edge research to construct a neutral particle spectrometer (NPS) critical to confirm the understanding of the structure of the proton. The NPS enables a multifaceted experimental physics program at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, in which the PIs play a leading role. The participation of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students is an integral part of this project and contributes to the development of the technological work force in the USA. The all-female project leadership will provide role models that could encourage under-represented groups to pursue advanced studies in physics or technical fields.<br/><br/>The two-arm combination of neutral-particle detection as provided by the NPS and a high-resolution magnetic spectrometer offers unique scientific capabilities to push the energy scale for studies of the transverse spatial and momentum structure of the nucleon through reactions with neutral particles requiring precision and high luminosity. The NPS allows accurate access to measurements of so-called hard exclusive (the recoiling proton stays intact in the energetic electron-quark scattering process) and semi-inclusive (the energy loss of the electron-quark scattering process gets predominantly absorbed by a single pion or kaon) scattering processes. To extract the rich information on proton structure through spatial and momentum imaging, it is of prime importance to show in accurate measurements, pushing the energy scales, that the scattering process is understood. Precision measurements of real photons or neutral-pions with the NPS offer unique advantages here. The instrument will be built by a collaboration of researchers forming a consortium led by the Catholic Univ. of America and Ohio Univ. It will also include the Old Dominion Univ. and as non-lead partners, the Jefferson Lab, North Carolina A&T University, the Yerevan Physics Institute, U. of Glasgow, and the Institute of Nuclear Physics at Orsay."
0.359012,"Dispersal is a critical life-history trait linking ecological and evolutionary processes. Transport of planktonic larvae affects colonization success and population persistence for benthic animals, and influences genetic subdivision of populations, local adaptation, and speciation. However, recent studies question the long-held assumption that pelagic larval duration (PLD) determines how far larvae are advected. This has applied significance, as oceanographic models used to predict exchange among marine protected areas often use PLD as the key larval parameter. The investigators' data for Caribbean gastropods show genetic breaks that are not congruent with model predictions, and levels of structure that are inconsistent with larval lifespan, highlighting a need for new theory. <br/><br/>Intellectual merits: This research will integrate molecular and larval ecology to test the link between dispersal and larval duration in a phylogenetic framework, and determine whether Individual Based Models (IBMs) accurately predict exchange for Caribbean reef ecosystems. The PI will collect multi-locus genetic data and quantify larval behavior for 14 related, ecologically similar species of sea slugs with PLDs from 0-30 days. The PI predicts that larval behavior explains why some species are under- or over-dispersed relative to their PLD; this work will reveal key parameters needed for biophysical-coupling models to predict connectivity for coastal invertebrates. The proposal will address 3 inter-related objectives: (1) Are genetic connectivity estimates from mtDNA and nuclear markers congruent, and consistent with model predictions? Data for mitochondrial and nuclear loci will be used to test for selection on mtDNA, estimate rates of gene flow and times of divergence, and assess levels of connectivity within each species. Matrices of model-predicted exchange will be compared with genetic similarity matrices to test whether breaks in gene flow occur where predicted. (2) Are genetic connectivity and PLD correlated? More broadly, the PI will test the assumption that larval period determines dispersal, using comparative methods in a phylogenetic framework to correct for effects of relatedness among species. The PI will compare models of trait evolution with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to determine if gene flow is correlated or uncorrelated with PLD, using a molecular phylogeny and multi-locus genetic data. (3) Does larval behavior explain genetic structure in species with long PLD? At least two of the focal species selected for this study are under-dispersed, with genetically isolated demes despite a 30-day PLD. Conversely, at least one short-PLD species has no genetic structure over large regions of the Caribbean. The PI will build on past work quantifying larval behavior to ask if species-specific differences in larval swimming facilitate local retention, making species deviate from expected connectivity patterns. The PI will also test whether pre-competent larvae respond to habitat cues in a way that influences dispersal, as occurs in fish. This work will reconcile life-history theory, oceanographic models, and genetics by mechanistically explaining breaks in connectivity; the results will deepen our understanding of how larval behavior can determine the pace of divergence among populations. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Student training is a major thrust of this proposal, based at a Hispanic-serving institution. Funding will support undergraduate and M.S. students from under-represented ethnic groups (5 of 9 current research students are Latino or black). Krug will publish with graduate and undergraduate student co-authors, and work to place students in Ph.D. programs; in the last funding period, 7 papers had student co-authors and two minority students were accepted into Ph.D. programs. Through established partnerships, the PI will host one area high school teacher and 3 students in the first year of funding for research experiences. Continued outreach through COSEE-west will allow the PI-led group to increase content knowledge for K-12 science teachers using examples from marine ecology and evolution. Public outreach will include bimonthly segments on the local NPR affiliate radio station (KPCC), and lectures at the K-12 and community college level through programs aimed to broaden diversity in the science and technology workforce."
0.095,"This project investigates the speculative possibility of storing energy in turbulent fluid eddies, and then suddenly releasing this energy. When gas is compressed, its temperature increases. However, the increase in temperature might be less if there are other degrees of freedom that absorb the energy. Suppose, for example, that the gas energy resides mainly in whirling eddies, rather than in completely random motion. We ask the question whether there are conditions under which compression of the gas might increase this eddy energy. The significance of this question is that energy in eddies acts differently than random energy because neighboring molecules tend to move in the same direction. That means that there would be fewer times that gas molecules would make high-impact head-on collisions. Important processes such as nuclear fusion depend on this relative motion, so the fusion reactions would be fewer in gases where the energy resides in whirling eddies rather than in random thermal motion. If this were true, then one might also speculate that the effect could be used advantageously in controlling nuclear fusion in a highly compressed plasma. <br/><br/>This project investigates the possibility of storing and then suddenly releasing the energy that can be deposited into turbulent fluid eddies in a plasma. It is conjectured that, under compression on a time scale in which viscosity may be neglected, the energy in such eddies might increase. Also, if the energy resides in hydrodynamic eddies rather than ion temperature, it means that it is unavailable to electrons through collisions. Thus, this energy cannot be easily captured by electrons and radiated. If the compression increases eddy energy more than the random energy, a new paradigm for storing energy in a highly compressed plasma might be advanced in which the energy content is increased under compression in a non-radiating plasma, and then suddenly released under viscous dissipation. To test these speculations, particle-in-cell simulations will be performed to describe compressing turbulent eddies, with guidance obtained from Z-pinch experiments that already appear to exhibit certain features of a turbulent inviscid plasma. This work will involve a collaboration between Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and will be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of Understanding on Research Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation. This project is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering."
0.065,"This workshop will bring together leading international researchers from Germany, Japan and the United States to discuss how to address the rapidly changing demands being placed on the power grid. The recent deployment and integration of more renewable energy sources to the electric power grid coupled with the shutting down of nuclear units in some countries or switching over from coal to natural gas is placing unprecedented stresses on the power grids around the world. This workshop will investigate new system architectures and control paradigms to address these challenges.<br/><br/>An electricity supply less reliant on fossil fuels is central to any meaningful approach to a sustainable energy future. Encouragingly, renewable generation has grown rapidly in recent years. The US will have 65 GW of installed wind capacity by the end of 2014 with anticipated continued rapid growth for several years. Solar PV costs have dropped dramatically. Internationally for reasons of safety, national security and environmental concern, we see similar trends as well as the shutting down of nuclear generation. These changes all place new demands on the existing power transmission infrastructure. Germany and Japan have some of the most aggressive plans for moving to a low carbon future. This workshop with the support of the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency and the German Research Foundation (DFG) will bring together researchers and educators in electric energy and sustainability from across the globe to discuss relevant issues to these changes.<br/><br/>A primary goal of the workshop is to learn about research activities in power and energy from the different countries and to discuss ways to leverage the on-going efforts and develop collaborations. Specifically, we wish to take advantage of the progressive changes in electricity sources occurring in Germany, Japan and the US and learn from these developments. Topics for discussion include renewable energy generation, the smart grid, demand response, energy storage, HVDC and supergrids, distributed controls, microgrids and various new control paradigms. The workshop will examine control, communication, computational science, environmental, energy, power systems and social aspects of electric energy and sustainability. A report will be generated discussing accomplishments of workshop along with action items."
0.470602,"The interactions of the fundamental particles inside atoms underpins atomic physics, chemistry, and the structure of all matter. The understanding of these interactions is based on precise measurements of the light that is emitted and absorbed by various atoms and molecules. The precise set of colors (or ""resonant frequencies"") of this light is a unique fingerprint that is used for chemical identification in a broad range of applications from medicine to defense and quality control in manufacturing. The precise measurement of the fingerprint can also tell us details about the fundamental particles that make up atoms. Recently, a measurement of a particular resonant frequency in hydrogen (an electron bound to a proton) and muonic hydrogen (a heavy version of the electron, the muon, bound to a proton) has revealed a mystery: the diameter of the proton appears to be different depending on which atom it is in. This mystery arises if one assumes that the electron and muon interact with the proton by the well-accepted theory called bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED) and that any differences must be attributed to the nuclear structure. Assuming that there have been no mistakes, there are 3 possibilities: QED is incorrect, the nuclear structure is incorrect, or there is some new kind of interaction which has not been taken to account. To decide whether the mystery is due to a problem with QED or not, two scientists from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) propose to measure the resonant frequencies of positronium, the simplest atom (consisting of an electron bound to an anti-electron) that should be described perfectly by bound-state QED theory. The new techniques developed for these measurements will lead to an improvement in the spectroscopy of unstable atoms which are at the frontier of the field of precision spectroscopy. The scientists involved with the project have a strong record in increasing diversity in physics. The PI plays a special role in the local community K-12 system, advising on increasing the number of students taking high school physics and increasing the pool of physical science/engineering majors in higher education and in teacher training. The co-PI has established a pipeline for recruiting local area junior college transfers to UCR, engaging them in research, and mentoring their eventual applications to graduate schools.<br/><br/>The purely leptonic atom positronium is uniquely well-suited for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED) and provides the understanding and background by which one may extract non-QED physics out of precision atomic measurements on heavier leptons and hadrons. Few have dared to try measurements on positronium at the few parts in 10^12 level that would allow insight into physics such as the proton charge radius and higher level recoil effect corrections in muonium, and that might show differences between light and heavy leptons. The ideal level spacing for a precision measurement on positronium is the 1S-2S interval at approximately 1.234 PHz. Last measured in collaboration with S. Chu, knowledge of the first 10 digits of this interval has stood for 20 years with an uncertainty of 3.2 MHz. The proposed experiment implements a new technique that would dramatically improve the accuracy of Ps atom spectroscopy and potentially other high resolution spectroscopy experiments, for example in muonium, by individual atom trajectory analysis. A position sensitive time-of-flight detector will record the trajectory and speed of every detected atom and thereby remove second-order Doppler shifts, AC Stark Shifts, and better account for transit-time broadening. The new detection method will allow for reducing the laser intensity and the speed of the detected atoms that heretofore have limited the measurement precision. The basic features of the analysis and development of the methods to analyze and reduce uncertainties will be accomplished using a wavemeter with 2 MHz metrology relative to an ultrastable reference cavity. This method will be sufficient to produce narrow line widths (~1 MHz) and a vastly improved signal-to-noise ratio in the 3 year period of the proposal. A 100 fold better measurement and exploration of the systematic effects at 1000 fold better accuracy will be achieved with the acquisition of a laser frequency comb reference."

The group will investigate the structure of the biologically important glycosaminoglycan (GAG) carbohydrate with two-dimensional NMR methods.<br/><br/>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an important physical chemical method that gives precise chemical and structural information. The methods that Prof. Larive and her student researchers will develop will enable scientists to determine the solution-phase structures of some important carbohydrates. The work has the potential to provide important information on the biosynthesis of these carbohydrates, as well as guiding scientists in the design of new drugs and measurements of purity of related GAG-based pharmaceuticals (e.g. heparin). The graduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in developing cutting-edge analytical NMR experiments. As part of this work, Prof. Larive will continue her strong efforts at encouraging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences."
0.779998,"With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A program is funding the research of Graham Fleming of the University of California Berkeley to develop two new experimental methods to study the way energy flows through individual molecules, even if that flow is affected by the solvent the molecules might be dissolved in. Molecules in living tissue, for example, are always surrounded by a great deal of water and other substances that affect the way those molecules absorb energy from light and redistribute it. The influence of the water or other solvent can be quite large, and currently available experimental techniques are unable to separate the effects of the solvent from the molecule of interest. In this project, two new methods are being developed. The first method, which is called ""two dimensional electronic-vibrational spectroscopy,"" or 2D-EV, will enable the investigators to directly observe the flow of light energy in, for example, a green plant as it undergoes the process of photosynthesis. The second new technique being developed in this work, known as ""two dimensional fluorescence-detected coherent spectroscopy,"" or 2D-FDCS will more directly measure the influence of the solvent (usually water) on the molecule of interest. This work is having a broad impact on scientific infrastructure through the development of new devices so solve problems ranging from biology to materials science. Students at all levels will participate, including young students from local schools in the Oakland area who might not otherwise have the opportunity to consider a career in science.<br/><br/>This project has two aims: (1) to investigate electronic-vibrational coupling; and (2) to understand the role of the solvent environment in preserving quantum coherence. To achieve these aims, two new methodologies are being developed. The first of the new methodologies involves the construction of a new two-dimensional spectroscopic technique, 2D-EV, used to elucidate the involvement and role of nuclear motions in molecular and nanomaterial electronic dynamics. This technique measures the interplay between electronic and vibrational coordinates by correlating the electronic (visible) spectrum with a second dimension, the (mid) infrared spectrum of the system, as a function of waiting time. The ability to follow the ultrafast temporal evolution of both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom allows the study of coupling between electronic and nuclear dynamics in, for example, regions of the potential surface where the Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, such as in situations where conical intersections occur. By providing a site-sensitive tag, the method is, thus, enabling direct exploration of energy flow pathways. The second new technique, 2D-FDCS, aims to extend photon echo and related techniques to small ensembles and, eventually, single molecules. This method can be used to detect weak signals from small ensembles and single molecule nanoparticles and is allowing a sampling of fluctuations as well as the distribution of environmental frequencies. The result is new insight into the role of the solvent environment in destroying quantum phase and the degree to which the ensemble average masks the true microscopic dynamics. The group is also using theoretical methods to interpret their experiments and inform new directions for study."
0.228671,"Quasars are the most luminous objects in the universe. The active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is the quasar's powerhouse can outshine its entire host galaxy. In the more than fifty years since their discovery, a picture has emerged of a quasar as a supermassive black hole residing at or near the center of a large galaxy. Interstellar gas in the galaxy, perhaps the residue of stars disrupted by tidal forces as they orbit close to the black hole, falls into the black hole and in doing so is heated to very high temperatures and emits copious radiation over a wide range of wavelengths. Along with the gas inflow, it is also clear that quasars drive gas out of the nuclear region. An outstanding question in the evolution of galaxies is to what extent the outflow from a quasar expels the interstellar medium, thereby quenching star formation in the host galaxy. This effect could have a strong influence on the development of galaxies at early times in the universe. This project will use newly-developed imaging and spectroscopic techniques to study nearby active galaxies in fine detail to gain insights as to how and from where the outflow is driven. It will also study a sub-sample of active galaxies that may have double active nuclei at their centers. In addition, it will contribute to an established workforce development program on Maui and a teacher training program in California.<br/><br/>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that quasars in the early universe drive massive galactic outflows that expel much of the interstellar medium in their host galaxies. These outflows are needed to quench star formation, limit black hole accretion, and give rise to observed relationships between the central black hole?s mass and properties of the galaxy's bulge. Without them, it is difficult to explain the old stellar population and low gas content of local ""red and dead"" massive galaxies, as well as their steeply declining number at high masses. For high-redshift galaxies it is difficult to study outflow processes in detail, because the galaxies have small apparent sizes and faint fluxes. This project will study the physical processes of nuclear outflows for nearby quasars and luminous infrared galaxies (0.01 < z < 0.15), using laser guide star adaptive optics coupled with integral field spectrographs which can map emission and absorption lines on scales of 10 - 100 pc in the host galaxy. The outflow characteristics thereby deduced from observations in the near-infrared will be compared to those at other wavelengths, including molecular observations by the Herschel satellite, ALMA, CARMA, and the SMA, and visible observations with integral field spectrographs such as Gemini's GMOS instrument. The project will also include observations of active galactic nuclei from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with dual [O III] emission lines at 0.2 < z < 0.6 to identify outflows and distinguish them from dual active nuclei."
0.96,"The UWMLSC group will contribute several critical elements to create a low-latency streaming on-line search for transient gravitational waves, such as those produced during the coalescence of binary neutron stars or black holes, the most anticipated gravitational wave signal. Among the data analysis elements we will create are the streaming data calibration system, a low-latency system for determining data quality and glitch vetoing, and on-line searches for signals from inspiralling compact binaries and for generic unmodeled bursts. Such a system to rapidly identify signals will be an essential element of gravitational wave science in the Advanced Detector Era, and will enable multi-messenger astronomy in which observations of several kinds (gravitational waves; electromagnetic waves; high energy particles) are synthesized to obtain a detailed understanding of the sources of the most cataclysmic events in the universe. Gravitational wave astronomy will reveal the inner mechanism of the mysterious gamma ray bursts, will provide a means to measure the population of black holes and determine the channel by which massive black holes are grown, and will probe the fundamental nature of matter above nuclear densities. New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, which will complement existing observations. Gravitational wave observations will also provide sensitive tests of Einstein's General Relativity in ways in which it has not yet been scrutinized. The opening of the gravitational wave window onto the universe can potentially evince exotic objects such as naked singularities, cosmic strings, or unexpected physics. We must be ready to address these scientific challenges as our new astronomical facilities come into operation. To this end, this award will support work that may result in the first gravitational wave discoveries of compact binary coalescence, provide rapid sky localization to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, observe black hole formation channels and probe fundamental properties of black holes through their quasi-normal modes of oscillation, scan the sky to find undiscovered rapidly rotating neutron stars and to learn about their properties, test cherished principles of gravitation such as the no-hair and cosmic-censorship conjectures, and seek new exotic and unexpected phenomena.<br/><br/>Our work supports the creation of critical components of a system that will allow the rapid transmittal of gravitational wave observations to the entire community of astronomers, and facilitates the integration of gravitational wave science into the broader field of astrophysics. The group has a solid track record of educating new researchers; this project will have a broad impact by training a new generation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members in gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as conveying the excitement of this budding branch of astronomy to the community through outreach efforts such as the UWM Planetarium."
0.480607,"We are pursuing two experiments at Amherst College. The first project is a continuation of our experiment to test Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI) and CPT invariance. LLI is the notion that the laws of physics are the same in all locally inertial frames and independent of their orientation in space. CPT is the product of the discrete symmetries charge conjugation, parity and time. No violation of either LLI or CPT has ever been observed. Much of our understanding of fundamental physics would have to be radically altered if a violation is observed. We compare the relative precession frequencies of Hg and Cs magnetometers as a function of the orientation of an applied magnetic field with respect to the ""fixed stars"". This comparison is sensitive to LLI violating couplings between a preferred universal frame and the electron, neutron and proton spins. With our recently completed experiment, we have placed new limits on several LLI violating terms. It has been pointed out that these limits may actually probe physics on the Planck scale, where String Theory suggests that violations might occur. We indend to replace the magnetometers with ones of a new design that should be at least a factor of twenty more sensitive. At this level, the experiment will provide the most stringent heavy-atom test of several possible mechanisms for violating LLI and CPT.<br/><br/>In our second project we are exploring the possibility of laser cooling thallium fluoride (TlF) using a transition between the v=0, J=1 of the ground state to the v'=0,J'=1 state of the triplet B state. Methods to cool molecules using lasers have only recently achieved some level of success. The difficulty with laser-cooling of molecules stems from the myriad of possible states available for decay. It is hard to find a cycling transition which will allow the tens of thousands of absorption/emission cycles that are required to achieve significant cooling. In recent work, we have demonstrated that with only one cooling laser and one repump laser it should be possible to achieve several thousand photon cycles on this transition without significant loss to other levels. This should allow transverse cooling and collimation of a cryogenic beam. Here, we intend to make precision measurements of the other critical Franck-Condon factors. Their determination will tell us precisely how many repump lasers would be required to bring a cryogenic beam of the TlF to rest. We also intend to measure the B state hyperfine structure (HFS) and isotope shifts. The HFS plays a critical role in determining the rate of loss to other rotational levels. If the laser cooling and trapping of TlF is possibile, this would open up the possibility of performing a high-precision search for the electric dipole moment of the Tl nucleus. Such an experiment is sensitive to the Schiff moment of the Tl nucleus which is in turn sensitive to the proton edm and time-reversal violation in the nuclear interaction.<br/><br/>Both of these projects have as their long-term goal the investigation of the fundamental symmetries of nature. Even though they are relatively modest table-top experiments, they have important possible implications for particle physics. The local Lorentz invariance experiment can provide limits on String Theory while a future thallium fluoride (TlF) electric-dipole moment experiment would test time-reversal symmetry in the proton and in the nuclear interaction. These projects, using the precision techniques of atomic and laser physics, provide a broad and flexible training for future scientists. The TlF experiment will expose our students to the exciting and emerging field of the laser-cooling of molecules. This project nicely compliments both the BEC work being done here by Prof. David Hall and the uv laser development that is being pursued by our new assistant Professor David Hanneke as part of his work on trapping single ions. Our fundamental symmetries experiments at Amherst have drawn many talented undergraduates into careers in physics over the last 29 years. This project will continue our tradition of pursuing state of the art experiments while providing exciting research opportunities and valuable training for undergraduates."

0.304999,"This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to uncover the mechanisms of sigma phase and chromium carbide formation in friction stir processed austenitic stainless steel. An Eulerian finite element approach will be used to predict temperatures, strains, and strains rates in the stir zone so that fraction recrystallization can be predicted for different tool speeds and feed rates. The modeling work will be combined with experiments to test the hypothesis that sigma phase and chromium carbide formation can be minimized or eliminated when friction stir processing is done under conditions that avoid dynamic recrystallization. Phase identification will be performed on processed specimens by electron backscatter diffraction and by transmission electron microscopy for model validation. Hot cell experiments on irradiated stainless steel will test a second hypothesis that friction stir processing can be done without causing helium cracking in the heat affected zone of the stirred region. <br/><br/>This research will provide fundamental understanding of the role of recrystallization on sigma phase and chromium carbide formation in friction stir processed austenitic stainless steel. A new approach for repairing stress corrosion cracks in nuclear components will emerge from the fundamental research results. As current fusion welding processes cause helium cracking during repair of components that have been irradiated for twenty or more years, this new approach has the potential of overcoming a major technical challenge in maintaining our fleet of aging reactors, which is critical to the national energy infrastructure and the economy. Additional societal benefits include the education of students who will be prepared to contribute to the nuclear industry, and an outreach program working with high school teachers on new curriculum development, aimed at encouraging female students to pursue careers in science and engineering."

This is evidenced by jets of material emitted by a minority of quasars but also by an outflow seen in absorption in the spectra of many quasars. These objects are called broad absorption line quasars or BAL quasars in reference to the broad spectral features due to mildly-ionized atomic species seen in their ultraviolet spectra. Long thought to be oddities, it is becoming clear that many or most quasars demonstrate such spectral features when viewed along certain lines of sight. An outstanding question is how the BAL outflow is generated. Is it gas that is launched from very near the black hole or is its genesis from somewhere outside of the nuclear region? The answer is important because, depending on its strength, the BAL wind can affect the properties of the host galaxy through so-called quasar feedback. This project will use detailed spectral analysis and imaging of a number of BAL quasars to better determine where the BAL gas originates and what its properties are. The project will engage a number of undergraduate researchers many of whom are women or underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Arguably the most important parameter to be determined for broad absorption line outflows is their distance from the central source (R). A definitive answer will go a long way to: (a) determine whether these outflows are energetic enough to generate the sought after ""quasar mode feedback,"" which is suggested by theorists to be a key mechanism for influencing the assembly history of galaxies and clusters; (b) establish the role of the outflows in the connection between the supermassive black hole and the host galaxy; (c) allow for realistic modeling of the outflow's origin and acceleration. Most AGN researchers and especially dynamical modelers, favor a picture where BAL outflows are launched from the AGN accretion disc and are observed in its vicinity (R~0.01-0.1 pc). However, in a recent series of papers the principal investigator's team measured R to more than 20 outflow components in 10 individual quasars and in every case found R to be between 100-10,000 parsecs. The large difference between the previously assumed and measured R has dramatic consequences since the outflow's mass flux and kinetic luminosity are linearly dependent on R. A prominent result was the team's finding of the most energetic quasar outflow measured to date, with ample kinetic luminosity to be a major contributor to AGN feedback. Therefore, if these large R flows are representative of most BAL outflows, they can supply the theoretically desired quasar mode feedback. This project will advance this unique observational and modeling program by observing a heterogeneous set of objects, to analyzing samples in well-designed surveys, acquiring direct imaging spectroscopy of these outflows, and extracting R from rich new data sets of BAL variability. The result should definitively assess whether BAL winds can be a dominant agent of AGN feedback."
0.375,"This award, an Industry-University Collaborative Project between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and scientists and engineers at Northrop-Grumman Corporation, demonstrates a new type of nuclear magnetic resonance using noble-gas nuclei. The essential innovation is to use an integrated atomic magnetometer to get the best signal-to-noise ratio, while greatly suppressing potential errors introduced by the magnetometer. The resonator is of fundamental interest for searches for spin-dependent symmetry violation tests, and of practical interest in improving the state-of-the-art in NMR gyroscopes. The key to the new approach is the concept of synchronous spin-exchange optical pumping, wherein the magnetometer atoms and the nuclei are made to precess at the same frequency. Estimates of technical noise indicate the system has a potential frequency noise level of better than 1 nHz/ Hz, with fundamental limits that are much better. The oscillator will be used to set new stringent limits on the potential couplings of potential dark matter candidates to nuclei. The resonator will also be evaluated for use as a precision NMR gyro. While the developments here represent a substantially new approach to NMR oscillators, the Industry-University collaboration will allow industrial expertise with conventional NMR oscillator technology to be leveraged for accelerated development.<br/><br/>In addition to the normal academic research training of undergraduate and graduate students, the project provides substantive exposure of students to industrial scientists and engineers working in an R&D environment. Students benefit from industrial expertise in areas such as electronics, magnetic field, and thermal design. The work being pursued has both fundamental and practical applications and the nuclear magnetic resonator will be evaluated in particular for potential applications to navigation"
0.176544,"This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating III-V Nitride piezoresistive microcantilever based neutron detector technology to fill the critical technology gap in the neutron detection area arising out of severe worldwide shortage of He-3. The translated technology has the following unique features: (i) vacuum enclosure of the microcantilever sensors, which will result in highly sensitive detection of nuclear radiation, as well as protection of the sensor from environment and unwanted radiation enhancing sensor reliability; (ii) possibility of using arrays of sensors realized through microfabrication techniques, which can offer imaging capabilities and directionality information; (iii) the usage of bimodal detection technique and two functionalization layers to perform highly efficient and unique detection of neutrons. Thus, it provides exemplary performance, cost savings and efficiency when compared to the leading competing neutron detection technology based on Boron-10 in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by using a relatively inexpensive material with unique material properties and adopting a design strategy involving the design features mentioned above, resulting in a novel neutron detector prototype. The partnership engages Savannah River National Laboratory to provide guidance in the He-detection market space and other aspects including prototype testing and technology commercialization, as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be in several tens of millions of dollars in the next eight years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this highly critical neutron detection market space. The societal impact, long term, will be in the creation of high-tech workforce and a safer society with vastly mitigated nuclear related threats."
0.596335,"This award will allow for the establishment of a strong research and educational development program in the field of ultrafast atomic, molecular, and optical sciences in the Department of Physics at the University of Arizona. The program will study atomic and molecular response to strong transient electric fields with simultaneous use of IR and XUV pulses in attosecond precision experiments. This will involve measurement and control of electronic and nuclear dynamics in highly-excited molecules using attosecond/femtosecond resolved pump-probe experiments. Ultrashort XUV excitation provides direct access to an interesting and challenging regime, where atoms and molecules are energetically far from their ground-state configuration. Using attosecond time-resolved XUV+IR experiments, we can measure the effect of strong electric fields on excited bound-state wavepackets in atomic systems. These measurements will offer new opportunities for the control of electron dynamics on attosecond time-scales. In molecules, the XUV excitation is associated with fast inner-valence electron phenomenon, correlated two-electron processes, and strongly interdependent electronic and nuclear dynamics. The understanding of time-resolved dynamics in this regime has been very limited due to the spectroscopic difficulties in probing inherently low cross-section photo-fragmentation channels; the complexity of the potential energy surface manifold in highly-excited systems; and the paucity of efficient, tunable, femtosecond/attosecond XUV photon sources. This project aims at investigating this regime by utilizing cutting-edge research tools, such as, tailored XUV pulses, and efficient photo-fragment imaging schemes.<br/><br/>The broader aspects include the CAREER educational objectives that will increase the representation of Hispanic students in physics research; directly involve undergraduate students in ultrafast science research; and lead to the development and web-based dissemination of interactive learning programs. This training and outreach, along with the forefront research will help make our nation more competitive in the field of attosecond and femtosecond science. The educational plan targets students from an under-represented group. In collaboration with a primarily Hispanic institution (UTEP), Hispanic students will obtain hands-on experience and vital exposure in a cutting edge field of research. With the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, the educational program leads to the development of interactive learning programs in optics/AMO, along with a method for web-based publication and dissemination, in a manner that will be useful to wider community. The research spin-offs of this program will be in the form of new insights and discoveries, which will impact other related fields such as quantum optics, theoretical atomic and molecular physics, coherent control, atmospheric chemistry, chemical imaging and radiation chemistry."
0.66,"High energy physics (HEP) experiments use extremely large data sets to study the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces that govern their interactions. To use computing resources most effectively, the investigators will study algorithms and develop codes that run well on computers which provide especially high performance for parallel execution of instructions, including general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and other many-core/multi-core architectures. These studies, and the community tools to be developed here, will extend the quantitative reach in HEP and allied fields to the point where they enable qualitative advances. To enhance the broader impact of this work, the investigators will distribute the statistical analysis toolkit as Free and Open Source Software. In addition, the investigators will disseminate their results about effectively writing GPU-friendly algorithms via talks, short courses, and journal articles.<br/><br/>The specific HEP context for this project will be developing tools for analyzing data from the next generation of experiments. The last major elements of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics (which describes the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear interactions of fundamental particles) have been experimentally validated in the past decade. Detailed measurements of particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the decays of B-mesons by the BABAR and Belle collaborations led to Kobayashi and Maskawa sharing the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. The ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN discovered a Higgs-like boson in 2012, leading to Englert and Higgs sharing the 2013 Nobel prize in physics. The codes and toolkits to be developed here will enable HEP experiments to search more effectively for phenomena not described by the SM, sometimes called Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) physics. ATLAS and CMS are searching for direct evidence of BSM physics at the highest energies. Belle-II, the next generation electron-positron flavor factory being built in Japan, has a design luminosity two orders of magnitude greater than that of Belle, providing complementary BSM sensitivity in very high statistics studies of B-meson decays, charm mixing, and searches for lepton flavor violation. The LHCb experiment at CERN has already surpassed BaBar and Belle by more than an order of magnitude in many channels, and the resulting BSM constraints complement those from ATLAS and CMS. Analyzing the data from all these experiments will require disproportionately more computing power at a modest increase in cost. In addition to developing generally useful tools, the statistical analysis toolkit developed here will be applied to analyze data from LHCb."
0.42544,"With this GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry) award from the Chemical Measurements and Imaging program in the Chemistry Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate, Professors Carlos Meriles at the City College of New York (CCNY) and Orlando Auciello of the University of Texas at Dallas and their students will partner with investigators at Advanced Diamond Technologies, Inc. (ADT), Romeoville, IL to perform basic and applied research and development of novel technologies that exploit the properties of near-surface paramagnetic defects in diamond. The project will combine crystal growth techniques, spin control schemes, and microfluidics and molecular labeling technology to develop chip-integrated structures where a target analyte is brought in contact with paramagnetic centers -- specifically nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and substitutional nitrogen -- generated near the surface of ultra-pure diamond. The central goal is to use the paramagnetic centers as sensitive probes tailored to detect the presence of pre-defined trace materials in solution. The research plan includes a range of proof-of-principle experiments explicitly conceived to facilitate the transfer of these sensing technologies to the market. The basic and applied science to be performed and the systems that will ensue are likely to find broad use ranging from chemical analysis and medical diagnostics, to bio-defense, environmental monitoring, and food safety.<br/><br/>Magnetic resonance (MR) measurements are well known for the usefulness in medical imaging, but a close variant of these measurements are widely used in chemical analysis because they provide a wealth of information about sample composition and molecular structure. However, the detection limits of MR measurements are typically too high for use in trace analyses, such as environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics. This project will seek to lower the detection limits of MR measurements by coupling the target molecule to tags that produce very strong MR signals as they interact with deliberately induced defects in diamond films. Besides the technological and scientific advantages, this project will enrich the education of PhD students and postdocs through training in entrepreneurship and new venture creation. To meet this goal, the investigators plan various activities that build on the close ties to their industrial collaborator ADT, a company presently commercializing a new generation of industrial and biodevices based on exclusive thin-film diamond technology. The proposed R&D program includes internships for students and postdocs under the combined supervision of an academic mentor and an industry partner, student-oriented seminars by lead industrial scientists, and regular cyber-enabled interactions designed to facilitate the transfer of research results to industry. These plans gain special meaning at CCNY and UTD, two institutions with a large population of minority students. Capitalizing on the various recruitment channels at hand, the teaching, mentoring and career counseling components of this project will truly broaden participation, while encouraging groups underrepresented in the sciences to pursue scientific careers both in academia and industry."
0.197,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging.

Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.02268,"When massive stars (those with at least 8 times the Sun's mass) reach the end of their existence they can explode releasing large quantities of heavy elements that enrich the next generation of stars. Modeling these core-collapse supernovae and their ejecta requires complex and well resolved three-dimensional numerical simulations running on large computers. The abundances of heavy elements (known as 'metals' to astronomers) has increased from none in the very first stars formed after the Big Bang to the Solar-like composition found in recently formed stars in the nearby universe. Supernovae are dependent on the pre-explosion structure of the star, which is dependent on both the stellar mass and the amount of 'metals' in the star. To cover the variation through cosmic time in the stars that explode as supernovae we will compute three well-resolved 3D supernova simulations for low, medium, and high mass exploding stars at each of three 'metallicities' representing the build-up of heavy elements from the primordial zero metallicity to solar metallicity. From these simulations the investigators will extract the properties of the explosions and their ejecta to get a better understanding of the nature of the supernova mechanism and its contributions to the evolution of galaxies through cosmic time.<br/><br/>The investigators will use their multi-physics Chimera code, which includes neutrino radiation hydrodynamics with modern neutrino-matter interactions, general relativistic corrections to multi-pole self-gravity, a dense matter nuclear equation of state, and built-in nuclear networks to compute evolving abundances in the non-equilibrium layers outside the iron-core and in the ejecta. The three simulations of 1-degree resolution will be computed at each metallicity from low (about 10 solar mass), medium (15 solar mass), and high (about 25 solar mass) progenitors found to explode in similar 2D (axisymmetric) simulations. Simulations will be computed at zero, solar, and low metallicities and both direct and post-processed nucleosynthesis will be computed for the ejecta. Additional analyses will produce gravitational wave and neutrino signals that directly probe the central supernova engine."
0.399,"NON-TECHNICAL:<br/><br/>Ionic polymer membranes are used to purify water, convert chemical energy to electrical energy (batteries and fuel cells), and conduct a wide variety of chemical separations. By controlling membrane chemical structure, it is possible to generate desirable highly conductive (but soft and liquid-like) regions that are surrounded and supported by mechanically and chemically robust regions. A key problem in designing new membranes lies in understanding the details of these various regions in the membranes, and how these regions affect the movement (transport) of water and ions such as lithium, sodium, and chloride. This project pulls together disparate techniques and theories, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), computational simulations, electron microscopy, and X-ray analysis, to understand how membrane structure influences properties. Indeed, new insights into membrane behaviors can only arise from such a combined multi-disciplinary approach. Such new fundamental knowledge would enable the design of membrane structures to accelerate ion and water motions. In turn, these advances in design would provide valuable information to engineers and entrepreneurs to increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of devices such as water purification systems and advanced power sources. Since membrane technology represents a $15B (and growing) commercial market, such advances could bring huge gains in US productivity and competitiveness. The project also involves education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as K-12 educational outreach.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL:<br/><br/>Membrane-separations applications such as reverse-osmosis water desalinization and fuel cells involve the selective transport of water, alcohols, and ions through an ion-containing polymer (an ionomer). What effects drive the transport of these various mobile species inside an ionomer membrane? These effects can be thought to arise from a combination of two major contributions: 1) local intermolecular interactions such as ion and water associations, polymer chain topology, or acidity; 2) morphological features such as phase symmetry (cylindrical, lamellar, cubic) and domain sizes and properties. This project will work toward an experimental and theoretical framework for quantitatively separating and fundamentally understanding these two major regimes that affect transport. By combining an array of cutting-edge nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods combined with molecular dynamics simulations, microscopy and X-ray analyses, this project will systematically study water and ion diffusion as well as local intermolecular associations inside ionomer membranes and thus build a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of permeation and selectivity in these materials. Starting with existing theories of molecular transport, fluid permeation through porous media, electrolytic transport, and oriented soft matter, new thinking and theories will arise regarding membrane behaviors. In a broader context, this project aims toward design of all new materials that are less expensive, more efficient in energy use, more robust, and more specific to desired tasks. Students and collaborators involved in this project will gain sophisticated and fundamental knowledge of polymer membrane behaviors. This new knowledge will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus, and propagated to children and their parents in a K-12 educational outreach program in the New River Valley region of Southwest Virginia."
0.126,"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is on the brink of making the first direct detections of gravitational waves. With the improved sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, we expect to enter an era of astronomy in which frequent gravitational-wave measurements are used to learn about astrophysical sources. The inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars is a likely source for many gravitational-wave observations, and waveform models for the inspiral of such systems can be used to detect the signals using matched filtering. However, additional physics near merger is not captured by detection templates. As the stars coalesce, the gravitational waveforms will depend additionally on the properties of matter in the core of the stars. The relevant behavior is encoded in the equation of state of dense matter. Its effects on gravitational waveforms have not yet been fully modeled; while ever-improving analytic models in the inspiral and numerical simulations of the merger each contribute information, a complete picture remains elusive. This award supports a program of research by the PI and her students at California State University Fullerton (CSUF) to understand the effects of neutron-star matter on inspiral and merger, both by constructing hybrid (analytical-numerical) waveforms with explicit error estimates and by developing phenomenological waveforms which incorporate tidal resonance effects. The results will be incorporated into the public LIGO Algorithm Library for use in realistic search and parameter-estimation studies with the full data analysis infrastructure. <br/><br/>The proposed research is essential to maximize the astrophysical return on NSF's investment in LIGO. Improved understanding of measurement potential will inform configuration decisions as Advanced LIGO develops. Gravitational-wave measurements of neutron-star matter effects will potentially shine new light on the equation of state of matter above nuclear density, which is currently uncertain and a key research topic in both nuclear physics and astrophysics. This proposal also supports active involvement by undergraduate and masters students in the Physics program at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate Hispanic-serving institution with strong integration of teaching and research. Including students in cutting-edge research introduces them to the gravitational-wave science community, kindles future participation in science, and develops broadly applicable skills. The PI is actively involved in LIGO outreach, and will engage students, the University, and the surrounding community in the excitement of this new field of astronomy."
0.068752,"Helium is one of the most important geochemical tracers of Earth's internal composition and evolution. It consists of two isotopes: 3He, which has a primordial origin, and 4He, which is the product of uranium and thorium decay. The ratio of these two isotopes in samples derived from Earth's mantle is variable, as are the ratios for many other elements. A long-standing question is how the observed heterogeneity in isotopic composition relates to the heterogeneity that is observed by other means, including seismic imaging. To answer this question, it is necessary to know on what length scales isotope heterogeneity can persist in Earth's mantle over geological time, against diffusive and convective mixing. Because helium is a highly mobile element in geological materials, it can provide a lower limit on the length scale of heterogeneous regions that are sampled by geochemical methods. However, while the mobility of helium has been determined experimentally in shallow mantle materials at low pressures, no information is yet available on the mobility of helium in the deepest 80% of Earth's mantle. The proposed work will provide the first data on helium mobility in these deep mantle materials. <br/> The proposed research combines both experimental measurements and first-principles calculations. Experiments will be carried out at CWRU and Harvard to determine the mechanism and rate of He diffusion in periclase, as well as its solubility, over a wide range of temperature and pressure. The diffusivity of He will be determined by incremental outgassing step-heating experiments on He-saturated crystals using the noble gas mass spectrometer at Harvard. Helium diffusivity and solubility at high pressures will be determined through time series experiments in sealed noble-gas charged capsules followed by bulk He analysis of the recovered crystals. Theoretical first-principles calculations will be carried out at the University of Wisconsin to determine He diffusivity and its mechanism in both periclase and MgSiO3-perovskite. The calculations will provide a critical cross-check on the experimental data and extend the study to deep lower mantle conditions that are experimentally inaccessible. The proposed research will provide a fundamental constraint on the minimum length scale of geochemical heterogeneity that can be maintained in Earth's deep mantle. It may also provide indirect insight into the helium mobility in nuclear reactor materials, where helium embrittlement is a persistent problem, and in proposed nuclear waste disposal materials, which include perovskite-structured oxides."

0.076603,"To first order, the Earth is divided into three concentric shells of different nature: the metallic core, the rocky mantle, and the fluid atmosphere/hydrosphere. While samples are available from the mantle and atmosphere/hydrosphere, the nature and composition of the core remain poorly understood. In particular, the core is known to be less dense than pure iron-nickel alloy, indicating that another light element is present in the core, possibly oxygen, silicium, or sulfur. The conditions (pressure and temperature) under which Earth's core formed and the nature of the light element in Earth's core are two major unresolved questions in planetary sciences. Because no core samples are directly available for study, scientists rely on remote seismic observations or other indirect methods to address those questions. In the proposed work, the approaches of geochemistry (the chemistry of the Earth), mineral physics (solid state physics applied to natural materials), and computational techniques will be combined to set limits on the temperature condition during core formation and the nature of the light element in Earth's core. This will be achieved by examining the extent to which different isotopic flavors of silicon and iron were partitioned between metal and silicate when the core formed. The work will involve synthesizing minerals in the laboratory and compressing them to pressure conditions relevant to the deep Earth by confining the samples between two diamonds, measuring the strength of the iron bonds in those minerals at a synchrotron source that produces very energetic X-rays, and examining, through computer calculations, the behavior of matter under high pressure and temperature. This work can impact many fields of science, ranging from the origin of Earth's dynamo to characterization of extrasolar planets through measurement of their mass. All PIs will actively engage in training and educating graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs in the proposed research projects. The PIs will continue developing SciPhon, a user-friendly, free software for NRIXS data reduction. This program will be made available to various communities studying different aspects of NRIXS, including geochemistry, mineral physics, material sciences, condensed matter physics, and biochemistry. All PIs will be actively involved in outreach programs including the UTeach Outreach Program that conducts academic summer camps for underrepresented K-12 kids from the Austin and southwest Texas area. <br/><br/><br/>The mass of the Earth and its accretion history are such that core-mantle differentiation was probably unavoidable but considerable uncertainties remain as to how and when this took place. Our limited understanding of this major event arises from our lack of sampling of Earth's deep interior. Scientists have devised indirect approaches to address this shortcoming by relying on (1) mineral physics experiments to reproduce the high pressure-temperature conditions prevailing in Earth's interior, (2) theoretical calculations to mimic those same conditions, and (3) geochemical measurements of the composition of mantle rocks to search for telltale signatures of core formation. These strongly interweaved approaches have led to significant progress but first-order unanswered questions remain, such as under what pressure-temperature conditions did the core form, what is the nature of the light element in the core, and did core formation fractionate Si and Fe isotopes. Terrestrial basalts have non-chondritic Si and Fe isotopic compositions, which could reflect partitioning of these elements into the core, although other interpretations exist. The investigators propose to establish Si and Fe isotope fractionation factors using high-pressure nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) and theoretical calculations at deep mantle conditions via collaborative approaches in geochemistry (Dauphas), theoretical ab initio calculations (Wentzcovitch), and experimental mineral physics (Lin). The derived force constants of Si and Fe bonds in basaltic glasses, lower-mantle minerals (bridgmanite and ferropericlase), and Fe alloys will allow us to build a deep-Earth geochemical model to evaluate if the specific Si and Fe isotopic compositions of the silicate Earth reflect core partitioning, and if they do, put constraints on important aspects of core formation such as temperature or the presence of Si as a light element in the core. The experimental results will serve as a benchmark for ab initio calculations of Si and Fe isotopic fractionation between relevant metal and silicate phases at high pressure and temperature. The theoretical work will in turn guide and refine the experimental and geochemical modelling efforts, focusing in particular on nuclear resonant measurements, force constant derivations, anharmonic and spin crossover effects. The exchanges and feedbacks between geochemists and experimental and theoretical physicists involved in this project will provide a holistic view of Si and Fe isotopic fractionation during core formation."
0.3,"Objective: The goal of this project is to explore an approach for detection of magnetic field, both magnitude and directionality, with less than 1 femto-Tesla resolution and better than 10 microns location error in a 10 square centimeter form-factor. The proposed approach is based on implementation of a densely packed array of glass micro-scale cells. Each cell is a hundred micron in diameter and is filled with isotopes of rubidium and buffer gasses. Cells are equally spaced on the same substrate, a hundred micron apart, and each cell acts as a highly precise all-optical atomic magnetometer.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This project will investigate the precession of nuclear spins as the measure of magnetic field magnitude and spatial distribution of magnetometers as a measure of magnetic field gradient. Contrary to SQUIDs, the proposed atomic magnetic gradiometer will not require cryogenic cooling and will not have any moving mechanical parts. A high-performance magnetometry can potentially be achieved by measuring the apparent change of the precession frequency of nuclear spins in response to a weak magnetic field.<br/>Broader Impact: Highly sensitive, small size, and easy to use magnetometers can have transformative effects in various areas including biology and biomedical engineering, geology and mineral/oil exploration, as well as surveillance and defense (through wall/underground imaging and target tracking). Small size and convenience offered by the proposed microscale devices can lead to significant advances in brain mapping and enable development of advanced portable brain monitoring devices. The accessibility of such technology for personal use in the form factor of hand-held devices will revolutionize, for example, personal health-care, on-demand diagnostic, and self-monitoring of chronic deceases. The most noticeable contribution will be in the area of biomagnetism, that is, the detection of the weak magnetic fields produced by the human brain, heart, and other organs. This research will advance scientific knowledge in the areas of innovative sensing concepts, signal processing, and system-level implementation. This highly multidisciplinary project will also provide unique educational experience for undergraduate and graduate (including underrepresented) students through team collaborations."

Hundreds of human diseases and many phenotypic variations in plants are known to be the result of alterations affecting this communication. However, the nature of nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions in plants is poorly understood. Wheat has the largest array of alloplasmic lines containing cytoplasmic genomes derived from wild and related species than any other mammalian, insect, or plant system and is an ideal model system for the study of nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Studies in the PI's laboratory showed that alloplasmic lines containing cytoplasm from wild wheat relatives showed significantly increased disease resistance, vigor, and productivity when compared to the corresponding euplasmic (with true cytoplasm) lines. Sequencing data from these lines also show that not only does the mitochondrial genome change by replacement of the nuclear genome but that those changes result in alteration of mitochondrial gene expression patterns. This EAGER proposal will investigate the role of cytoplasmic modifications in stress tolerance which could provide a new way of breeding for biotic and abiotic stress in crop plants. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine the extent and role of cytoplasmic genomes on biotic and abiotic stress tolerance by investigating ~100 alloplasmic lines for resistance to pathogens and salt stress; 2) identify the cytoplasmic genome that is responsible for the altered response to biotic and abiotic stress; and 3) investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of cytoplasmic genomes on stress tolerance. This project will advance understanding of the role that cytoplasmic genomes play in providing increased tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressin plants and will be important in breeding. Current breeding strategies rely purely on homogeneous cytoplasmic background of the predominant species. This study could change this paradigm to take advantage of cytoplasmic genomes from wild species that confer tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. <br/><br/>The research activities will be interfaced with the University of Minnesota's programs designed to recruit and train students at all levels. A postdoctoral scientist will be mentored and advised by the two PIs and given training in genomics, bioinformatics, grant writing, networking and teaching, according to the individual development plan designed by the postdoctoral associate. All sequencing data generated by this project will be deposited in public databases such as NCBI.

The project will study methods for transferring information between the spins in two distinct subsystems: the electron spin in a quantum dot and the electron spin (or nuclear spin) of a phosphorous donor. The high degree of tunability of gated quantum dots offers the possibility of new ways to interact with nuclear spins (which are highly coherent) via electronic degrees of freedom (which can be manipulated and measured very rapidly). This project seeks to probe new types of hybrid states between a donor and a quantum dot, and to use those states to bridge the length scale mismatch between atomic donors and other semiconductor nanostructures. Computer modeling will provide a link between the experimental results and the underlying theory. Through this research, graduate students will be trained in areas including nanofabrication, electronic measurement, and theory. The project will also create a new outreach module, focused on nanoscience, and merge it with a program that currently reaches thousands of students each year.<br/><br/>****Non-Technical Abstract****<br/>Hybrid systems combine the desirable features of two or more technologies in a way that improves the performance of each component. This project seeks to develop hybrid ""molecules"" formed of individual real atoms embedded inside artificial atoms. The project will use artificial atoms formed in single-electron transistors that are constructed from two common semiconductor materials: silicon and silicon-germanium. This project will study methods for transferring information from the artificial atoms to the real atoms (and to the real atomic nucleus, where it is especially long-lived), and back again. From a practical perspective, the project seeks ways to manipulate atomic systems using tools that work well for silicon transistors. Fundamentally, the project will probe the interactions between real and artificial atoms-systems that have very different characteristic length scales. Computer simulations will be used to relate experimental results to the underlying theory. Through this research, graduate students will be trained in areas including nanofabrication, electronic measurement, and theoretical simulation.

0.303659,"Milkweeds (Asclepias) are common and ecologically important perennial plants of North American grassland and forest ecosystems. They are the only host plants of the monarch butterfly, a species of significant conservation concern. Because milkweed species diversified over a short evolutionary time span, reconstructing their relationships is exceedingly difficult and requires examination of a large amount of data from across their genomes and powerful computational techniques. This research will contribute to the development of new methods for more accurately determining evolutionary relationships when many species have been formed in rapid succession. The results will have implications for better understanding the coevolution between milkweeds and monarch butterflies and the evolution of plant defense, as well as provide a robust evolutionary context for understanding the results of other scientific studies exploring aspects of plant reproduction, genome evolution, and other areas using milkweeds. The project will train postdoctoral fellows and graduate student in the latest phylogenetic and bioinformatics methods thereby training the next generation of phylogenetic biologists.<br/><br/>This research will demonstrate the feasibility of solving difficult phylogenetic problems at the species level in plants by employing improvements in next-generation sequencing techniques. The work combines methods for targeted sequencing of hundreds of specific regions of the nuclear genome applied to unusually large within-species sampling. The project applies nuclear gene probes developed directly from Asclepias genome and transcriptome sequences to effectively target 768 genes and substantial amounts of their non-coding flanking regions. Phylogenetically useful off-target sequences, (e.g., complete chloroplast genomes) are also obtained. By sampling 20 individuals per species, the approach will distinguish common causes of gene tree discordance: incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. An analytic workflow will be applied that incorporates simulation of incomplete lineage sorting and a combination of species tree inference methods that are effective even when introgression has occurred. Because current species tree approaches are constrained by a computational tradeoff between the number of loci and number of alleles that can simultaneously analyzed, the project will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods. The large sample of loci will also validate the recognition of species not currently accepted in Asclepias. Undergraduate and graduate student training in genomics, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics will target participants from underrepresented groups. Project outcomes will reach the broader scientific community and the general public through workshops held at scientific meetings, K-12 education modules focused on milkweed ecology and evolution, and demonstration exhibits at a public botanic garden."
0.330697,"Essentially all eukaryotic cells, including those of humans, contain multiple genomes, and key biological functions depend on the interaction between the gene products that are encoded in each of these genomes. This project will address fundamental questions about how changes in one genome within a cell can elicit compensatory changes in another to maintain basic cellular functions. This work will provide training in cutting edge molecular genetic and computational techniques to students all the way from the undergraduate to the postdoctoral level, and findings from this research will be integrated into undergraduate education through the development of a new capstone course in molecular evolution at Colorado State University.<br/><br/>This research project will compare species of flowering plants that exhibit enormous natural variation in the rate of evolutionary change in their mitochondrial genomes. The project will generate and analyze large datasets of gene sequences from the nuclear genomes of these species. Analysis of sequence variation within and between these species will be used to identify changes in the nuclear genome in response to the different rates of evolution in the mitochondrial genome. Findings from these comparative analyses will be complemented by performing genetic manipulations in a well-established model species to test the biochemical and physiological effects of changes in specific genes."

Each student in the program will work on a well-defined research project under the direction of a faculty mentor. Students choose their projects from a list suggested by the faculty. A wide variety of projects, both experimental and theoretical, are available. In nuclear physics, MSU is the site of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, major centers located within a few steps of the Physics and Astronomy Department. REU students will also have access to state-of-the-art research facilities such as the Keck Microfabrication Facility, the MSU High Performance Computing Center, and numerous single-investigator laboratories in material science, biophysics, and physics education. Many faculty participate in national and international collaborations and have access to data from facilities covering a wide range of topics, from high-energy physics, neutrino and cosmic rays, to astrophysics.

0.078408,"Imagine a scenario in which illicit nuclear material may be in transit. How can we tell in a matter of minutes whether a truck, boat, railway car, or even a person with a backpack in a crowed street is a carrier of (possibly shielded) radioactive material? This project focuses on the underlying science behind the problem of timely detection of weak radioactive sources from a distance, by steering robots (ground and/or aerial) equipped with radiation counters. The proposed theory promotes national security objectives by providing improved decision-making algorithms. These algorithms can support both existing and future sensor technology, and help develop new detection tools which can form an effective layer of protection against radiological attacks at home, and contribute a useful tool for nuclear nonproliferation abroad.<br/><br/>Novel features of the methodology in this project include the model-based approach to active sensing, and the formulation of the detection problem in a way that is more compatible with real-world scenarios. This approach departs from the classical active sensing approaches by querying measurement models, as opposed to merely measurement data, in order to improve the performance of decision making. The approach signifies a paradigm shift for active sensing in sensor management: instead of relying on sensor measurements (data) to decide how to sample, here the approach is to rely on measurement physics (models)."

0.1405,"To first order, the Earth is divided into three concentric shells of different nature: the metallic core, the rocky mantle, and the fluid atmosphere/hydrosphere. While samples are available from the mantle and atmosphere/hydrosphere, the nature and composition of the core remain poorly understood. In particular, the core is known to be less dense than pure iron-nickel alloy, indicating that another light element is present in the core, possibly oxygen, silicium, or sulfur. The conditions (pressure and temperature) under which Earth's core formed and the nature of the light element in Earth's core are two major unresolved questions in planetary sciences. Because no core samples are directly available for study, scientists rely on remote seismic observations or other indirect methods to address those questions. In the proposed work, the approaches of geochemistry (the chemistry of the Earth), mineral physics (solid state physics applied to natural materials), and computational techniques will be combined to set limits on the temperature condition during core formation and the nature of the light element in Earth's core. This will be achieved by examining the extent to which different isotopic flavors of silicon and iron were partitioned between metal and silicate when the core formed. The work will involve synthesizing minerals in the laboratory and compressing them to pressure conditions relevant to the deep Earth by confining the samples between two diamonds, measuring the strength of the iron bonds in those minerals at a synchrotron source that produces very energetic X-rays, and examining, through computer calculations, the behavior of matter under high pressure and temperature. This work can impact many fields of science, ranging from the origin of Earth's dynamo to characterization of extrasolar planets through measurement of their mass. All PIs will actively engage in training and educating graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs in the proposed research projects. The PIs will continue developing SciPhon, a user-friendly, free software for NRIXS data reduction. This program will be made available to various communities studying different aspects of NRIXS, including geochemistry, mineral physics, material sciences, condensed matter physics, and biochemistry. All PIs will be actively involved in outreach programs including the UTeach Outreach Program that conducts academic summer camps for underrepresented K-12 kids from the Austin and southwest Texas area. <br/><br/><br/>The mass of the Earth and its accretion history are such that core-mantle differentiation was probably unavoidable but considerable uncertainties remain as to how and when this took place. Our limited understanding of this major event arises from our lack of sampling of Earth's deep interior. Scientists have devised indirect approaches to address this shortcoming by relying on (1) mineral physics experiments to reproduce the high pressure-temperature conditions prevailing in Earth's interior, (2) theoretical calculations to mimic those same conditions, and (3) geochemical measurements of the composition of mantle rocks to search for telltale signatures of core formation. These strongly interweaved approaches have led to significant progress but first-order unanswered questions remain, such as under what pressure-temperature conditions did the core form, what is the nature of the light element in the core, and did core formation fractionate Si and Fe isotopes. Terrestrial basalts have non-chondritic Si and Fe isotopic compositions, which could reflect partitioning of these elements into the core, although other interpretations exist. The investigators propose to establish Si and Fe isotope fractionation factors using high-pressure nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) and theoretical calculations at deep mantle conditions via collaborative approaches in geochemistry (Dauphas), theoretical ab initio calculations (Wentzcovitch), and experimental mineral physics (Lin). The derived force constants of Si and Fe bonds in basaltic glasses, lower-mantle minerals (bridgmanite and ferropericlase), and Fe alloys will allow us to build a deep-Earth geochemical model to evaluate if the specific Si and Fe isotopic compositions of the silicate Earth reflect core partitioning, and if they do, put constraints on important aspects of core formation such as temperature or the presence of Si as a light element in the core. The experimental results will serve as a benchmark for ab initio calculations of Si and Fe isotopic fractionation between relevant metal and silicate phases at high pressure and temperature. The theoretical work will in turn guide and refine the experimental and geochemical modelling efforts, focusing in particular on nuclear resonant measurements, force constant derivations, anharmonic and spin crossover effects. The exchanges and feedbacks between geochemists and experimental and theoretical physicists involved in this project will provide a holistic view of Si and Fe isotopic fractionation during core formation."
0.66975,"The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon. Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.<br/><br/>A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging. This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.<br/><br/>Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. <br/><br/>The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school."
0.03975,"High consequence materials are materials that if released into the environment in an uncontrolled manner, might cause damage or harm to people, animals and the Earth, itself. Examples of such materials include nuclear waste, biological contagions for which there is no cure (like the Ebola virus), and even return samples from outer space that may harbor unknown compounds or life forms. The chance of contamination of the general public by any of these materials is extremely small, however, there are professionals that are exposed to these types of dangers on a regular basis. Since these professionals must handle these materials, it is paramount not only for their safety, but for the safety of the general public, to take extreme measures to ensure that any and all possible mistakes are minimized and contained. <br/><br/>This workshop explores current practices and difficulties of handling these types of materials with the goal of learning common methods and practices that cut across all such materials. This is referred to as the ""science of safety"" and it promises to benefit national priorities by making dangerous materials safer and more productive, by protecting citizens, healthcare workers, emergency responders, and researchers from accidental exposure, and by promoting business by streamlining procedures and improving work environments. The workshop will bring together 20 experts in US and 10 experts from Japan, France, Korea, Sweden, UK, Spain, and Italy. International collaboration will be expanded through this project via lessons learned from our international partners. International participation is particularly important because the unique nature and infrequent occurrence of exposure events make it desirable to gather the most pertinent experiences from around the world. Japan, Korea, France and the United Kingdom are particularly sought for their complementary strengths in both nuclear and biological fields."
0.158515,"Existing wireless networks do not perform in many hostile and complex environments, including the underground, underwater, oil reservoirs, groundwater aquifers, nuclear plants, pipelines, tunnels, and the concrete buildings. The wireless networking capability in such environments can enable important applications in the environmental, industrial, homeland security, law enforcement, and military fields, such as monitoring and maintenance of groundwater and/or oil reservoirs using wireless sensor networks, damage assessment and mitigation in nuclear plants using robot swarms, or real-time projection of information to and from military squads in unknown tunnels and bunkers, among others. However, the harsh wireless channels prevent the direct usage of the electromagnetic (EM) wave-based techniques due to the high material absorption when penetrating the lossy medium. Moreover, since practical environments can be complex combinations of air, water, soil, concrete, and metal, solutions only applicable for one single medium, e.g., acoustic wave based networking for underwater medium, do not work. To this end, this project investigates the wireless networks based on a new communication mechanism, i.e., metamaterial-enhanced magnetic induction (M2I), which can establish reliable wireless connections in the aforementioned hostile and complex environments. The project can eliminate the environmental barriers to existing wireless applications and radically change current communication and sensing systems.<br/><br/>The project will explore the fundamentals of M2I-based wireless networks through a closed-loop combination of mathematical modeling, simulations, and experimental evaluation. M2I uses magnetic induction (MI) as the physical signal carrier for best penetration. Different from the very limited range in most MI techniques, M2I takes advantage of a metamaterial layer outside each antenna to achieve reasonable communication range for practical applications (tens of meters with pocket-sized devices). Moreover, all the nodes in the wireless network as well as the conductive objects in the environments are strongly coupled together (due to M2I), forming a Meta-environment, which enables unique networking functionalities, such as the passive relaying and environment-aware localization. The core contributions are in four main thrusts: (i) M2I antenna modeling and design; (ii) channel, interference, and capacity analysis under the new networking paradigm; (iii) environment-aware localization algorithms based on the M2I-enabled cognition capability; (iv) performance evaluation and prototyping through a cross layer simulator based on Comsol Multiphysics and NS-3, and a testbed based on software-defined radios and lab-fabricated metamaterials."
0.159786,"The properties of H2O at high temperatures and pressures are important to know for both volcanic and magmatic processes, as well as for processes that impact the geothermal energy, nuclear waste, and chemical engineering industries. This research, using newly developed, novel laboratory techniques, such as hydrothermal diamond anvil cells coupled with Raman/Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, will be used to make real time measurements of the solvation of gases and metals in light and heavy H2O at supercritical conditions. This project will bring new experimental techniques to bear to understand the systematics of hydrogen gas and methane dissolved in electrolyte-rich supercritical fluids by looking at the isotopes of hydrogen in the context of the evolution of geothermal fluids in the subsurface and the degassing of magmas in volcanoes. Data collected will be used to augment theoretical models of water cycling in Earth's interior. The experiments and their interpretation will also shed light on the mass and heat transfer associated with Earth's deep hydrological cycle as well as the interaction of geothermal fluids with the solid Earth, a process that contributes to the flux of carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases to the atmosphere. Broader impacts of the work include providing fundamental knowledge about H2O at high temperatures and pressures, which has implications for a broad array of fields in science and engineering, such as chemical engineering (e.g. toxic/radioactive waste remediation, nuclear power reactors), physical chemistry, geophysics, geochemistry, and energy-related research. In addition, a series of lectures and lab demonstrations will be created and presented to undergraduate and graduate students at the George Mason University in Virginia. Undergraduates will have an opportunity to be involved in the project through a 10-week internship program at the Carnegie Institute of Washington that will run during the summer both years that the award is active. <br/><br/>Technical aspects of the research involve study of the exchange of deuterium and hydrogen isotopes between various hydrogen bearing volatiles (H2, CH4, H2O). The work will examine these volatiles in the context of understanding the thermal regime of volcanic settings and the source of magmatic fluids. For example, deuterium-depleted brines derived from seawater contribute to the hydrogen-isotope composition of Cl-rich melt inclusions in mid-ocean ridge basalt glasses. However, the composition of these brines is completely unconstrained, hindering efforts to trace the hydrogen-isotope composition of the mantle source of seafloor basalts. Furthermore, at present, there are no experimental data to describe the effect of degassing during magma ascent on the D/H exchange between H2(aq), CH4(aq) and H2O dissolved in Cl-rich, F-rich fluids, or aqueous fluids that contain common ions found in seawater (i.e., Na/K/Mg/Ca/Cl/F). In the latter case, the concentration and electrostatic properties of these ions on the structure of H2O and how they affect the solvation mechanism and solubility of H-D isotopologues of H2 and CH4 in supercritical H2O-D2O mixtures will be examined. Measurements will be made in-situ and in real-time by employing hydrothermal diamond-anvil cells and Raman/FTIR spectroscopy. Results will be complemented by the use of GC-TC/EA-Isotope Mass Ratio Spectrometry to determine bulk D/H ratios and isotope fractionations between species equilibrated at high-P/-T during experiments in solid-media high-pressure apparatus. The proposed study will compliment and support the new frontiers of H-D CH4 isotopologue geochemistry."

0.61,"The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division of NSF is funding Dr. William Pomerantz from the University of Minnesota to develop nuclear magnetic resonance methods of fluorine detection to study interactions between proteins. The research and educational goals in the Pomerantz lab address long-standing questions about biomolecular communications between proteins, drawing from findings in the disciplines of both chemistry and biology. Proteins termed transcription factors are the master regulators of cellular function. They facilitate the complicated transfer of information that specifies how the DNA code is used to make proteins. This research seeks to understand the details of the interactions between proteins and their underlying biology. The element fluorine will be used as a sensitive reporter for difficult-to-detect interactions at protein interfaces. This method is advantageous in view of fluorine's unique spectroscopic properties and its absence in natural biological molecules. Given the importance of transcription factors, this fluorine-based approach for studying protein-ligand interactions could significantly increase the repertoire of new protein targets for study and thereby open up avenues for improving the understanding of a wide variety of protein function. This project will include training for students with no prior experience of working at the chemistry/biology interface and will engage the Osher Life-Long Learning community's interests in science literacy and the role of chemical biology in science and technology. <br/><br/>This research project is focused on the development of fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) methods for detecting, quantifying, and defining novel modes of interactions at transcription factor-protein interfaces that include epigenetic regulatory proteins. Due to the enrichment of aromatic amino acids at protein-binding sites, multiple labeling strategies for sequence selective incorporation of fluorinated aromatic amino acids will be evaluated for reporting on protein binding interactions. The hyper-responsiveness of the fluorine nucleus to changes in chemical environment leads to simplified 1D-biomolecular NMR spectra that can be rapidly acquired and readily interpreted. This method will be evaluated against known ligands to characterize their mode of interaction and also in discovery format using small molecule libraries. These studies will be extended to acquiring mechanistic information under physiological conditions by in-cell fluorine-19 NMR. The origins of cellular uptake of fluorine-labeled peptide macrocylces will be investigated using lanthanide shift reagents for differentiating extracellular versus internalized peptides. This fluorine-19 NMR method will set the stage for use as a structure-based tool to find new chemical probes for challenging protein-protein interactions. Given the importance of transcription factors, the proposed fluorine-19 NMR approach to study protein-ligand interactions could significantly increase the repertoire of new protein targets opening up avenues for improving the understanding of their biology."
0.093266,"Non-technical description:<br/>Traditional chemical synthesis methods resemble cooking in the sense that the ingredients, mixing methods, temperature, and pressure all may be varied to produce a desired result. Despite control over all of these macroscopic variables there are some chemical processes that remain elusive. Since the invention of the laser in the 1960s, the field of coherent control has sought to use the laser to manipulate chemical dynamics by applying energy of suitable color and duration directly to individual molecules. In this sense, the laser can be thought of as a new type of reagent that drives a chemical reaction. While easily stated, this task has proved challenging. Molecules are complicated and dynamic, making it difficult to determine the correct laser characteristics to drive a particular process. A proven method for approaching this problem is to use experimental feedback to guide an adaptive search of the possible laser pulses. In a physics version of natural selection, laser pulses that provide a better outcome are given an increased chance to survive and have their characteristics contribute to the tailored pulse that ultimately produces the desired outcome. Such a method, however, is only as good as the feedback that drives it. The goal of these studies is to develop enhanced image-based feedback techniques that enable this adaptive approach to coherent control of chemical dynamics. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The PI has recently developed the ability to use three-dimensional momentum imaging of the laser-molecule reaction products to define the control objective described in the non-technical description above. Using three-dimensional imaging to target a specific final state has led to better understanding of the mechanisms that undergird the laser-based control, especially in situations in which obtaining precise optical spectroscopic feedback is impractical. Increased mechanistic understanding can subsequently lead to better search parameterization, enhancing the adaptive control process. Current efforts are focused on applying image-based adaptive control to study and influence photoisomerization processes in small molecules such as ethylene. By studying photoionization, it is possible to probe how electronic excitation is rapidly converted to nuclear motion, an essential step in many ultrafast chemical processes. Ethylene is particularly interesting as a benchmark molecule for examining the role of conical intersections in these electronic to nuclear energy conversions. These studies will be advanced by using two-pulse experiments, which allow the separation of the ionization step from the subsequent evolution of the molecular ion, which the group hopes to control. Strong-field tunneling ionization of polyatomic molecules often involves multiple molecular orbitals, and studies of these relationships help link the image-based feedback to more specific target states, again with the objective of refining adaptive control methods. A goal of this project will be extending this work to explore the control of laser driven electron rescattering via feedback derived from angle resolved photoelectron distributions. Electron rescattering is an essential part of many ultrasfast laser-based processes, such as high-harmonic generation and the production of attosecond pulses, and therefore control of this sort has a number of potential applications. Finally, as an undergraduate institution, this project helps identify and develop talented students by immersing them in forefront research."
0.285,"TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>The project is aimed at understanding phase transformations and the appearance of new phases of matter in condensed matter systems. Of particular interest to this project is the study of quantum criticality, a type of material behavior that indicates that a phase transformation is occurring at the absolute zero of temperature. The project also seeks to understand novel states of frustrated magnetic materials such as ""spin liquids"" and non-magnetic ""hidden order"" phases. The study of the effects of magnetic disordered in the behavior of newly synthesized metallic glasses is the third focal point of this project. The techniques used in the project to study these ""strongly correlated"" materials are mainly nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin rotation (muSR). Examples of materials that will be studied are: Yb3Pt4 (quantum criticality), Pr2Zr2O7 and Pr2Ir2O7 (frustrated magnetism), and bulk metallic glasses doped with Gd (disordered magnetic states).

A collaboration with CSULA Physics Department's University Preparatory Program (UPP) will be implemented to engage UPP students in summer research internships. Science field trips for inner city high school students will be carried out in this collaboration to increase awareness of science and technology, while providing minority students with hands-on experiences. Motivated students from neighboring Alhambra High School will participate in research and the project will promote their involvement in science fairs at state and national levels."
0.383369,"Nontechnical abstract:<br/>The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the microscopic response of strongly correlated electron systems to doping and pressure. By their very nature, these materials are highly sensitive to impurities, and dopants are frequently used to tune their properties. However, little is known about the microscopic behavior in the vicinity of dopant atoms, and how the impurities collectively modify bulk properties. This research project employs Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to probe high quality single crystals using a state-of-the-art diamond anvil pressure cell. A key focus of this project is graduate education, and it incorporates educational outreach activities to a broad range of students. Outreach efforts to a local elementary school include science projects that actively engage children in the scientific method and a course on condensed matter science for adult and senior citizen students through the university extension office. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>Strongly correlated electron materials hold tremendous potential for new technologies, but a fundamental understanding of their relevant many-body physics remains one of the greatest challenges in condensed matter physics. Chemical doping is widely used as a straightforward mechanism to tune the ground state of these materials, often revealing rich phase diagrams including unconventional superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid behavior. At the microscopic level, however, dopants strongly perturb the electronic degrees of freedom, in some cases giving rise to non-universal behaviors such as phase segregation and inhomogeneous glassy dynamics. These strongly inhomogeneous responses can mask intrinsic phenomena, and complicate the interpretation of bulk measurements. This project addresses the differences between doping and pressure as tuning parameters through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies of two prototypical correlated electron systems: the iron pnictide and heavy fermion superconductors. The research team is developing advanced new equipment to explore the microscopic behavior using diamond anvil cells to achieve large hydrostastic pressures, and mechanical clamps to achieve uniaxial strain in single crystals. Both techniques enable the study of the microscopic response of materials under conditions that have never been investigated with magnetic resonance previously. The outcome of this research is a more complete understanding how strong correlations in the presence of disorder influence macroscopic properties."
0.39532,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project is a collaboration between two of the leading research groups in the area of ultra-high temperature ceramics, namely the Institute for the Science and Technology for Ceramics (ISTEC) in Faenza, Italy and the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, MO. The team at ISTEC includes Dr. Frederic Monteverde and Dr. Diletta Sciti who are funded separately by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) in Italy. The focus of the combined effort is on fundamental aspects of processing and microstructure of boride-based ceramics to improve their mechanical properties at elevated temperature. Boride ceramics, such as zirconium diboride, are currently capable of withstanding sustained mechanical loads over a range of temperatures but fail catastrophically under extreme loads and under the extreme thermomechanical conditions for which they are being researched and developed. Applications include thermal protection systems for hypersonic flight, containment materials and fuel forms for nuclear reactors, high-speed cutting tools for machining, and ultra-high temperature refractories for metal production. The focal point of this project is the development of a dual composite architecture designed to create a new paradigm of structural ceramics with superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and in extreme environments. The ability to utilize dual composite ceramics in commercial applications, in extreme environments, will provide improvements in both energy efficiency and sustainability of future systems such as hypersonic aircraft and molten metal containment.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Utilizing the combined expertise of the research group at ISTEC in diboride-silicide ceramics and the processing and properties of hierarchical ceramic composites expertise of the research group at Missouri S&T, the goal of the project is the development of a new paradigm of dual composite ceramics with improved elevated temperature mechanical properties. Zirconium diboride that is liquid phase sintered with molybdenum disilicide is being used as a base composition for the dual composite ceramics, although the concept is broadly applicable to any thermodynamically compatible material system. The role of controlling the structure and microstructure of ceramics at multiple length scales (i.e., a dual composite architecture) on the elevated temperature mechanical behavior of boride-based ceramics is being investigated using experimental studies, physics-based models, and analytical characterization techniques. The project is timely based on the global need to develop new ceramic materials for applications in extreme environments. Furthermore, the outcome of the research has the potential to transform state of the art boride ceramics into ceramics capable of extending the lifetime and use temperature of ceramics for applications in extreme environments, including hypersonic flight vehicles, nuclear reactors, molten metal and glass containment vessels, and others. Finally, ceramic materials for extreme environments is an area of research and development that is highly specialized and in dire need of more trained scientists and engineers to lead future research efforts. The project is directly impacting this area of the ceramic field by facilitating the exchange of young, underrepresented researchers from both institutions and by directly training a graduate student and two undergraduate students in the processing, testing, and characterization of ceramics for use in extreme environments."
0.27,"This grant supports the research activities of the Pacific Lattice Group, consisting of Professors James Hetrick, Kieran Holland, and Keisuke Juge at the University of the Pacific.<br/><br/>This project concerns computational field theory in particle physics. There are four strands in this work, three involving theoretical study of strongly-interacting particles and one managing a scientific data archive gateway. The thrust of the first strand is to understand from basic principles how a few fundamental building blocks, the quarks and gluons of QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), generate the experimentally observed hadrons, such as the proton, neutron and other exotic particles, as well their properties and interactions. This work has significant relevance for nuclear physics. The second and third branches of this research program explore models of physics ""Beyond the Standard Model"", in particular investigating the possibility that the newly discovered Higgs particle might be a composite of ""quark-like"" particles, or even a manifestation of extra dimensional physics. Finally, the fourth part of this research program is the maintenance of a large, public, internationally accessible repository of lattice gauge theory data, allowing researchers around the world to access and build on the work of others, thereby significantly leveraging the investment in this work and that of other similar researchers.<br/><br/>The broader significance of this work is to advance our current understanding of the fundamental constituents, structure, and interactions of matter and the universe. The Standard Model of particle physics encapsulates the way that quarks and leptons interact, and explains all known accelerator data. This Model is much like the Periodic Table in chemistry at the turn of the 18th century: we have the table and its mathematical description of the interactions of its constituents, but we have no understanding of why the interactions take the form and structure that they do. In chemistry, the deeper understanding of the Periodic Table came with the next level of physics --- quantum theory, explaining why atoms have the properties and interactions that they do. We are at a similar crossroads now in our understanding of particle physics and the Standard Model, poised to break through to the next level of understanding of the structure of matter, and the results of this research project might potentially be one step in that direction. On the other hand, the data archive management component of this project uses the latest high-performance grid technologies to make the results of this work and other researchers around the world available to each other, greatly multiplying the return on the scientific investment made by the public."
0.005,"This award will provide partial support to enable junior scientists to attend the meeting entitled, ""Hot Quarks 2016: A Workshop on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions for Young Scientists,"" to be held in South Padre Island, TX, 11-18 September 2016. Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCS), the theory describing the forces acting within atomic nuclei, predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP). According to our cosmological models, this transition took place in the early universe at about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang. The scientific scope of this field has broadened significantly with new measurements and theoretical developments. The discussions in this workshop will include an interdisciplinary combination of concepts from elementary-particle physics, nuclear physics, QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and non-equilibrium transport theory. Attendance at the workshop will enhance the scientific communication among the junior members, particularly graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, both from experiment and theory."

Key features of the conference are recent results from experiments using cutting edge techniques, talks on a future polarized electron ion collider in the U.S., and new theoretical advances. Some of the technologies developed for this area of physics have found interesting applications, such as the use of polarized target technology for MR imaging of lungs and probing the surface of solids with stopped polarized muon beams.

0.127486,"The proton is a particle that is central to our understanding of matter in the universe. It is found in the nucleus of every atom and contributes to the fusion reactions that fuel the stars. Protons are constructed from basic building blocks of matter called quarks, antiquarks (the antimatter counterparts of the quarks) and gluons, but the ways in which these constituents contribute to the properties of the proton are not completely understood. For example, the proton has a property called spin, which is used in medical applications such as MRI scans, but detailed knowledge of how the spins of the quarks and gluons combine to give the spin of the proton is still missing. In this project the investigator will use theoretical models to study the contributions of strange quarks and antiquarks to the properties of the proton and compare the results to experimental measurements from facilities such as the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Undergraduate students will participate in the project, receive training in nuclear and particle physics that is complementary to their undergraduate coursework and gain experience in research methods and scientific communication. The students will present their work at professional meetings and to the broader public. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine the strangeness distributions of the proton and the contribution of strangeness to the proton's electromagnetic properties. Strangeness in the proton refers to its strange and anti-strange quarks, which are created by fluctuations of the proton into meson-baryon states or by quark and gluon interactions. Strangeness distributions describe the share of the proton's momentum that is carried by the strange or anti-strange quarks, which may differ from one another (strangeness asymmetry). Strangeness distributions are important both for our understanding of the structure of the proton, and because they affect the cross sections predicted for dark matter searches. The PI and her students will develop a meson cloud model to represent the fluctuations of the proton into pairs of strange mesons and strange baryons. A statistical model will be used to describe the strange distributions that are created in the mesons and baryons by quark and gluon interactions. Comparison will be made with experimental results for total strangeness and strangeness asymmetry. A light cone model of strangeness wave functions will be used to calculate strangeness electric and magnetic form factors, from which limits on strangeness in the nucleon can be determined from experimental measurements."
1.14,"The National Science Foundation grant to the Rutgers University Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics group will enable studies of the structure of the nucleon. We will study neutrino scattering from nuclei at the Fermilab National Accelerator Facility (FNAL). We will also investigate quark distributions within the nucleon with the SEAQUEST experiment at FNAL. We will participate in several upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab with the upgraded 12 GeV electron beam. Finally we are preparing for an experiment to scatter muons and electrons from the proton (MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland) in order to investigate the proton radius, which has puzzled scientists in recent years because of inconsistent results with different techniques.<br/><br/>Besides the scientific impact, this work will serve to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral researchers, in the methods of scientific research. This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers in and outside of physics. Our students and post-docs have successfully moved to varied careers in medical physics, homeland security, and finance, as well as continuing in fundamental research."
0.27,"An important quest in modern nuclear physics concerns the theoretical understanding of the structure of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in terms of quarks, antiquarks and gluons, the degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of strong interactions. In this project, the investigator and his students will advance the development of theory necessary to understand experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and other facilities world-wide. In addition to providing theoretical support for existing and future experimental programs, the benefits of this project include training for graduate students. The project will also offer research opportunities for undergraduate students at the frontiers of theoretical nucleon structure research.<br/><br/>This project will explore nucleon structure in terms of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). Based on a QCD factorization formalism, TMDs are a useful tool in the study of high-energy reactions. As compared to the familiar and better known collinear parton distribution functions which describe processes when no final-state transverse momenta are resolved, TMDs offer detailed information about dynamics. They provide access to parton orbital motion and aspects of spin-orbit correlations when polarized beams and targets are explored. The goal of this project is to advance the current understanding of the properties of TMDs in a non-perturbative framework. The specific objectives of the project are: (1) determine the non-perturbative properties of TMDs at a low initial scale, (2)identify model-independent signatures of chiral symmetry breaking with focus on sea quark effects, (3) explore phenomenological applications and present predictions for experiments. The tools employed in this project include the use of perturbative evolution equations, dynamical models, and effective chiral theories."
0.309063,"The Universe as we know it evolved from a very hot, dense primordial soup of fundamental particles that were created in the cataclysm known as the Big Bang. As the Universe expanded and cooled, these fundamental particles, called quarks and gluons, condensed into protons and neutrons, which eventually combined into nuclei that captured electrons to form atoms. Nearly everything we can observe is made from this fundamental material. Using large particle accelerators, scientists are recreating the conditions at the birth of the Universe in the laboratory by colliding gold or lead atoms at very high energies to study the properties and interactions among these particles. These investigations will provide us with clues to the deeper nature of the fundamental forces in the Universe.<br/><br/>One of the most important discoveries to come from such experiments is that the dense matter created in these collisions is opaque to very high energy quarks and gluons produced in them. These ""partons"" suffer tremendous energy loss as they make their way out of the collision zone, depositing a large fraction of their initial energy in the medium. The strength of the energy loss is directly related to the density of the medium and varies according to the type of parton. It appears that the heavier the parton, the more energy loss it suffers. Energetic partons fragment into a spray of particles called a ""jet"". If a jet contains a high energy electron, there is a very high probability that it originated from a heavy quark. The energy loss of these electron-jets can be used to investigate the properties of the quark gluon plasma medium through which it passed. The goal of this research is to disentangle the energy loss of quarks and gluons by isolating jets containing electrons and comparing their energy loss patterns to those without electrons.<br/><br/>The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland collides nuclei at the highest energies ever created in a laboratory. This RUI project will utilize the ALICE experiment to explore the properties of the quark-gluon plasma using the energy loss of heavy quark jets as a probe. Undergraduate students working on this experiment will be trained in the most advanced data collection, reduction and analysis techniques at the cutting edge of high energy nuclear physics. They will be able to apply these skills in a wide variety of careers, whether they choose to pursue an advanced degree in basic science or not. Their contributions will also help us develop new understanding of the fundamental interactions among the basic building blocks of matter, leading to a deeper understanding of the Universe we inhabit."

EXO, a multi-tonne neutrinoless double beta decay experiment employing xenon enriched to ~80% in the isotope Xenon-136, is now taking data at the WIPP underground site in New Mexico. However, the next generation of such experiments requires advanced background reduction methods to reach Majorana neutrino mass sensitivities below 0.01 eV.<br/><br/>EXO is developing a novel technique to tag the Barium (Ba) produced in the final state of the neutrinoless double beta decay using atomic spectroscopy. This technique has the promise of drastically reducing radioactive backgrounds, providing a clean and un-ambiguous measurement with unprecedented sensitivity. Recent breakthroughs have been obtained in the Ba-tagging front. These groups have produced, for the first time, Ba transport and tagging efficiencies above 1%. The R&D work funded with this award builds on such breakthroughs and aspires to provide the first demonstration of high efficiency tagging of individual Ba atoms in liquid xenon. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: While the primary scientific goal of this proposal is in the field of neutrino physics, its broader impact is substantial. The techniques being developed span a range of topics, from nuclear and particle astrophysics, to AMO, surface physics and material science. This research, if successful, is likely to be applicable to other problems in science and technology, where the high efficiency transfer and identification of single atoms would be of interest. Examples include trace analysis for homeland security applications and the detection of rare phenomena.

0.055,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure the energy of particles produced at small scattering angles from collisions of atomic nuclei at high energies, carried out at the Brookhaven National Lab using the PHENIX particle detector. These measurements will help to understand the new state of matter, a plasma of quarks, that is formed from such collisions. In particular, the results of this measurement are expected to probe the initial conditions of quarks and other strongly-interacting particles in the nucleus before the collision. In recent years, we have learned that the initial conditions of the quarks before the collision result in hot-spots within the quark-gluon plasma, and how these hot-spots spread their energy within the plasma provides information on this new state of matter. It is worth noting that this research program is carried out at an undergraduate institution, Muhlenberg College, and is a highlight of the Physics Department. Most of the physics majors have participated in it by the time of their graduation. Furthermore, almost all of the participants have chosen to continue in STEM fields after graduation.<br/><br/>Theorists have suggested that measurements of transverse energy are a barometer of a state of saturated plasma. Both studies of existing data from a relativistic heavy ion collisions (RHIC) experiment, called the beam energy scan, by the PHENIX Collaboration and work on transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions are testing gluon-saturation models in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. To date, transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions has not been reported. Associated with regions of higher net baryon chemical potential on the phase diagram of nuclear matter, these measurements, along with existing transverse energy measurements at central rapidity for a variety of colliding systems and beam energies, provide new insight into the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma."

We continue to lead the efforts to extend the measurement of the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio to the highest momentum transfers possible at Jefferson Lab, and also investigate the possible modification of this form factor ratio within the nuclear medium. These experiments will provide severe tests of the available theoretical models of proton structure, and will serve as a strong impetus for the development of more advanced models based upon quantum chromodynamics (QCD)."

0.52,"Lattice gauge theory provides the framework to study the excited spectrum of hadrons. As such, this project will help unravel key aspects of the physics of quark confinement and hadron formation in quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong interactions and one of the fundamental forces of Nature. In fact, understanding the physics of confining gluons is an important intellectual challenge and was recognized as one of the seven so-called Millenium Prize problems announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The masses of excited hadron resonances will be evaluated using Markov-chain Monte Carlo computer simulations of quarks and gluons on a space-time lattice. Results of these calculations are relevant to several ongoing experimental programs, such as the Hall B N* program and the GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. It is worth mentioning that in the past such calculations were performed with unrealistically large quark masses due to computational limitations. The current project continues the development of a new methodology to incorporate crucial multi-hadron operators into computations in order to reduce the quark masses to nearly their physical values.<br/><br/>The proposed research incorporates the participation of two graduate students, and possibly one or more undergraduate students, so the broader impact of this project concerns also the training of future researchers in the field of lattice QCD. The students are provided with an unique opportunity to learn and contribute to an important line of inquiry at the forefront of nuclear theory. Given the high-performance aspects of this projects, students will also acquire essentials skills in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources.

The project will also study confinement by exploring the properties of certain hadronic matter called hybrid/exotic mesons that are unique to QCD-like theories. In addition, this study will address related topics such as the existence of tetraquarks. The grand canonical ensemble for QCD-like theories at finite density will be rewritten as a sum over canonical ensembles to study two-dimensional QCD. The lessons learned there will be used to explore the feasibility for studying four-dimensional QCD at finite density."
0.936722,"The timing of flowering is especially important in plant development because it directly impacts reproductive success. For example, flowering at the wrong time could mean that important pollinators are not present or that fragile embryos will be subjected to freezing temperatures. Thus, plants have complex and highly specific mechanisms to harmonize flowering with the natural ecosystems in which they evolved. Understanding flowering time has further important implications in agricultural settings, as flowering time can have profound effects on the overall production of commercially valuable vegetative organs, fruits, and seeds. To properly time flowering, many plants have an internal clock that monitors day length (photoperiod) and seasonally activates genes that drive the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. In particular, activation of the floral integrator gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is an essential early step in the photoperiod-regulated transition to flowering. This project uses a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to specifically investigate how regulatory proteins called NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) mechanistically control FT expression to initiate flowering. In addition to potentially impacting agricultural production and our collective understanding of natural ecosystems, this project will train undergraduate and graduate students in both the research and classroom laboratories. Elements of the research aims will be incorporated into an upper division Plant Physiology course. Additionally, molecular plant biology forums will be initiated as part of an effort to improve collaborative interactions among Oklahoma researchers.

The research program builds on the PIs previous work on the QWEAK and DVCS experiments and one of its highlights will be data taking on one of the first experiments of the JLab 12 GeV era. The goal of DVCS experiments is ultimately to provide a simultaneous spatial and momentum mapping of the internal structure of the proton.

0.301065,"The scattering of high-energetic photons has been studied for many decades. The long interest in this endeavor is largely motivated by the study of nucleon and meson excitations, which manifest themselves as specific configurations of quarks or as gluonic excitation. The excitation of the glue that holds quarks and antiquarks closely together in mesons is predicted by the theory of strong interaction but has not been experimentally established. The GlueX experiment being constructed at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, VA, will be devoted to the search for such excitation. By using a high-energetic, highly polarized photon beam and a high-resolution detector with complete angular coverage, the GlueX experiment is predetermined to settle the question. Through NSF support, CUA is able to proceed with constructing and maintaining the broad-band tagging hodoscope and the polarized photon source for this experiment. Moreover, for many years CUA has been a leading institution in the polarized target program at JLab, aimed to measure all components of the scattering amplitudes in form of polarization observables, and thus to disentangle unambiguously the resonant contributions to the scattering. The grant provided by NSF will also support CUA's continuing efforts in the analysis of data taken on frozen-spin targets in JLab's Hall B.<br/>Their research aims for settling long-standing questions in our understanding of nuclear matter, which is comprised of quarks and gluons.

0.06,"The research supported by this award will probe the limits of our understanding of the weak interaction, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Among other things, the weak interaction is responsible for the type of radioactive decay called beta decay in which a nucleus is transformed into a different nucleus with the emission of an electron and a neutrino. The award will allow the two scientists to carry out experiments in which they precisely measure the energy of electrons emitted in four different nuclear beta decays. Three of these experiments will test key aspects of the Standard Model of the electroweak interaction, which is the theory that describes the unification of two of the fundamental forces, the weak interaction and the electromagnetic interaction. These precision beta decay measurements are complementary to particle collider experiments in the search for new physics. A fourth proposed experiment aims to resolve uncertainties in the beta decay of potassium-40, an important tool in geochronology. The research program has the further goal and benefit of training highly talented undergraduate physics students. Students involved will gain experience with state-of-the-art software and experimental techniques, and will learn to think independently and gain a variety of practical problem solving skills. The broader impact is felt when these students enter the workforce in STEM fields or in teaching. <br/><br/>The research program consists of several experiments involving the high precision measurement of the shapes of beta spectra. In two of the proposed experiments the goal is to provide a strong test of the Conserved Vector Current hypothesis in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model of particle physics. In a third experiment, the goal is to improve limits on non-Standard-Model contributions (Fierz terms) to the description of the weak interaction. A fourth experiment has the goal of resolving an uncertainty in the potassium-40 beta spectrum, which is relevant to applications in geochronology. Specifically, the carbon-14 beta spectrum will be measured using a new magnetic spectrometer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This spectrometer will be nearly identical in form to the superconducting spectrometer used to make the same measurement in oxygen-14, enabling reduced uncertainties arising from higher order matrix element contributions. Measurements in fluorine-20 and helium-6 will be carried out at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory using implantation into a scintillator detector, which will have significantly different systematic effects from the magnetic spectrometer measurements and will be important in achieving low thresholds. A fourth experiment has the goal of measuring the shape of the potassium-40 beta spectrum. Knowledge of this spectrum shape is important for a standard technique in radioactive dating of geologic samples, but a recent report suggests the shape may not be as well understood as had been thought. An important aspect of all these measurements is in assessing and correcting for systematic effects through measurement and computational modeling."
0.105,"This award funds a collaborative research program involving two separate angular correlation measurements with neutrons. These measurements will enable us to extract fundamental information concerning the weak interaction which causes neutron decay, including the axial coupling constant of the nucleon. This coupling constant appears in a very wide variety of nuclear and particle physics contexts, from being a critical input to high precision calculations of the solar fusion rates, to being a target for higher precison lattice QCD calculations, to placing, together with the neutron lifetime, limits on the existence of new particle physics interactions.<br/><br/>The first experiment, UCNA, measures the beta-asymmetry, or the correlation between the neutron polarization and the decay beta-particle's momentum. UCNA is the first experiment to use ultracold neutrons, or neutrons with energies below about 300 neV that can be stored in material bottles, for this kind of measurement. Ultracold neutrons have advantages both for neutron polarimetry and neutron-generated backgrounds, key sources of systematic error in existing neutron angular correlation experiments. The UCNA experiment is currently operating, with one more run period planned at the neutron densities currently available at the Los Alamos ultracold neutron source. The targeted precision is below 0.4%, roughly a factor of 2 more precise than the current world average for the beta-asymmetry. The second experiment, Nab, uses an unpolarized beam of cold neutrons (with temperatures near 30K) to measure the electron-neutrino angular correlation, with a planned sensitivity at about the 0.1% level for the electron-neutrino correlation. This experiment should also be able to place important limits on extensions to the standard model of particle physics for scalar and<br/>tensor couplings.<br/><br/>Key to the success of these experiments is the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars. These young scientists will receive excellent training in experimental techniques, particle detectors, and data analysis."

It is directly related to the structure of the proton, which is a basic constituent block of visible matter. This research will continue the development and construction of a novel hydrogen target to perform a new electron-proton scattering experiment, directly giving the proton radius with higher precision. The second project will measure the lifetime of a particle called the eta meson with high precision, which will be compared with theoretical predictions from the fundamental theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This project will also provide unique opportunities for students, both undergraduate and graduate, to be actively engaged in many different areas of interdisciplinary research: new hardware and cutting-edge software development; large scale data analysis and modern computational problems. In this way the research effort contributes to the development of a much-needed high tech workforce. <br/><br/>As one of the most fundamental quantities in physics, the proton charge radius new independent measurement will have far reaching effect in both atomic and nuclear physics. The currently developed experimental situation with this quantity limits the determination of the Rydberg constant, one of the basic and the most precisely known constant in nature up to now. The experimental results may be sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model. The projected 3% accuracy of the eta-meson lifetime measurement will potentially resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the Primakoff-type and electron-positron collider experiments. It will also improve the light quark mass ratio in a direct and model independent way."
0.16,"This project concerns a theoretical study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QPG), a state of matter thought to have occurred a few microseconds after the Big Bang. At that early stage of the Universe, quarks and gluons then combined to form the basic building blocks of nature, the hadrons that we observe in Nature today. This transition is being studied in ongoing experiments with heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This project will provide theoretical support to these experimental programs by calculating fundamental observables from first principles and systematically relating them to experimental measurements. By taking advantage of the unprecedented level of accuracy achieved in both theory and experiment, this project is expected to advance significantly our understanding of the QGP and will shed light on the nature of the phase transition and the degrees of freedom governing the mechanism of hadronic matter formation. The project will involve students in an international research activity addressing fundamental questions in high energy, nuclear and astrophysics. The PI is actively involved in outreach activities designed to promote physics in Houston schools and she will give public lectures and seminars. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a microscopic understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The methodology employed here is to calculate relevant observables from first principles and map them to experimental measurements through phenomenological models. The specific objectives are as follows: determine the temperatures and densities at which hadrons are formed and relate them to the ones at which hadron yields are fixed by experiments; constrain the existence and position of the critical point at which the order of the phase transition changes; establish whether the interaction is strong enough to enable sequential, possibly flavor specific, hadron formation in the QGP. Besides having immediate applications to RHIC and LHC experiments, the project will also help us understand the nature of matter formation in the early Universe, which might clarify a variety of astrophysical phenomena pertaining to the interiors of stars and the matter distribution in the Universe."
0.53,"Technical description:<br/>This award supports a program of research in experimental hadronic physics by the Arizona State University Meson Physics Group which will yield information crucial to achieving a better understanding of how hadrons are composed of quarks by providing a large data set detailing the excitation spectra of key two- and three-quark systems. In particular, the Meson Physics Group at Arizona State University will study the excitations of the nucleon, Cascade, and Omega baryons, as well as the excitations of gluonic flux tubes within mesons. The polarization data that the group will provide for the nucleon are essential for addressing one of the NSAC/OMB milestones for hadronic physics, and the ASU group is uniquely positioned to provide that data. The group is also participating in a conditionally approved experiment that will use the CLAS12 detector under construction at Jefferson Lab to produce and discover excited baryon states of the Cascade and Omega using quasi-real incident photons. The data to be obtained will further detail the excitations of three-quark systems and complements work being done by the group on excited nucleons. The Meson Physics Group at Arizona State University also will work with the GlueX detector, currently under construction in Hall D at Jefferson Lab, in order to search gluonic excitations within mesons of masses up to 2.5 GeV. The ASU group will assume primary responsibility for building a triplet polarimeter to directly measure the Hall D photon beam polarization. The results of these investigations will be broadly disseminated through conference presentations and refereed publications, and will be archived in public databases.<br/><br/>Broader significance and importance:<br/>No comprehensive theoretical description of how the nucleus of the atom is built from quarks can be achieved without a solid knowledge of the excited states. The data obtained from Arizona State University Meson Physics Group will further inform and test theoretical models used to understand the structure of matter that is comprised of quarks. In addition to potential discoveries in, and advancement of, the understanding of nuclear physics, the work to be supported will provide instruction and mentoring in science and technology to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to a postdoctoral research associate. The triplet polarimeter to be built will enhance the precision reached for experiments conducted in Hall D at JLab as well as those using the photon beam at Mainz, resulting in important improvements in the infrastructure of those laboratories."

0.233775,"This project will develop new analytic and computational methods to solve a variety of mathematical problems in the kinetic theory of plasma dynamics. Plasmas are often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids, and gases) and account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. Since plasmas are charged gases, they serve as excellent conductors of electricity, and thus are of great practical interest. As an example, plasma engines have been developed by a number of space agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, the use of plasmas within nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently of immense scientific interest. Other notable examples of plasmas include the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, and comet tails. A complete understanding of the solar wind would also be particularly useful, as this natural phenomenon dictates the intensity of ""space weather"", which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting the Earth. In general, the motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated partial differential equations dictated by physics. Among the goals of the current project are to demonstrate that these equations possess realistic solutions, determine their qualitative behavior, compute their sensitivity with respect to model parameters (such as masses, charges, and temperature), and computationally approximate them so that one can accurately predict outcomes in future situations.<br/><br/><br/>A plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are often strong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting, collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the Maxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity averages of solutions to the Vlasov equation. One major question this project will study is: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as in lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity variables), smooth global solutions are known to exist. Similarly, the associated Fokker-Planck system will be studied to further elucidate the smoothing influence of collisions on the particle distribution. Another problem to be investigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge density and electromagnetic field in the system. More specifically, do dispersive effects in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient interaction so as to sustain their strength even as time tends to infinity? Finally, the sensitivity of fields and densities with respect to model input parameters will be computed using global sensitivity metrics and particle-in-cell simulations."
0.21947,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. This grant will support present and future experiments at Jefferson Lab to investigate the quark structure of protons and neutrons. In particular, these experiments will explore how electrons scatter from the proton and from other electrons in a way which will test the fundamental theoretical model of physics, called the Standard Model. These experiments will help to advance the field of nuclear and particle physics, as well as provide a world class education to the graduate and undergraduate students working on those projects.<br/><br/>In the electron scattering experiments at Jefferson Laboratory in which the Louisiana Tech group is involved, many new physical observables will be measured. The physics available from these measurments include measurements of inherent properties of the weak interaction, allowing us to test predictions of the Standard Model of Particles and Interactions, and in particular the weak interaction parameter. Additional measurements will further probe the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing tests of predictions from existing theoretical models."
0.3,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. A primary area to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another, i.e. oscillate. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This particular project will focus on the study of the oscillations of the neutrinos between different types. The award will support the work of one post-doctoral researcher as well as graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This award supports work, using the neutrino beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), on the neutrino experiments: MINERvA and MicroBooNE, both measuring neutrino oscillations: muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. These oscillations are of great interest to the scientific community since they could show indications of BSM physics. To correctly measure these transitions, precise knowledge of neutrino interactions with nuclei is required. This award will be used to measure these interactions across a wide energy range available at FNAL, which will be beneficial for both neutrino and nuclear physics. This will improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux, useful for future Short Baseline (detector near the source at FNAL) and Long Baseline (detector hundreds of kilometers away)."
0.705,"This award funds a collaborative research program involving two separate angular correlation measurements with neutrons. These measurements will enable us to extract fundamental information concerning the weak interaction which causes neutron decay, including the axial coupling constant of the nucleon. This coupling constant appears in a very wide variety of nuclear and particle physics contexts, from being a critical input to high precision calculations of the solar fusion rates, to being a target for higher precison lattice QCD calculations, to placing, together with the neutron lifetime, limits on the existence of new particle physics interactions. <br/><br/>The first experiment, UCNA, measures the beta-asymmetry, or the correlation between the neutron polarization and the decay beta-particle's momentum. UCNA is the first experiment to use ultracold neutrons, or neutrons with energies below about 300 neV that can be stored in material bottles, for this kind of measurement. Ultracold neutrons have advantages both for neutron polarimetry and neutron-generated backgrounds, key sources of systematic error in existing neutron angular correlation experiments. The UCNA experiment is currently operating, with one more run period planned at the neutron densities currently available at the Los Alamos ultracold neutron source. The targeted precision is below 0.4%, roughly a factor of 2 more precise than the current world average for the beta-asymmetry. The second experiment, Nab, uses an unpolarized beam of cold neutrons (with temperatures near 30K) to measure the electron-neutrino angular correlation, with a planned sensitivity at about the 0.1% level for the electron-neutrino correlation. This experiment should also be able to place important limits on extensions to the standard model of particle physics for scalar and <br/>tensor couplings. <br/><br/>Key to the success of these experiments is the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars. These young scientists will receive excellent training in experimental techniques, particle detectors, and data analysis."
0.27,"In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John Brennan of Rutgers University probes the fundamental chemistry of the actinide elements combined with the chalcogens sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, including the synthesis and characterization of both molecular and nanoscale materials. An understanding of how actinides interact with these chalcogens improves our ability to separate actinide ions in nuclear fuel reprocessing and environmental waste remediation.<br/><br/>The project begins with the synthesis and characterization of select molecular actinide compounds with a variety of chalcogenolate ligands. A series of molecules with potential covalent bonding character are targeted in order to evaluate how the metal, oxidation state, chalcogenolate, and Lewis base donors influence structure and bonding. These will serve as model systems for theoretical calculations to uncover the nature of the bonding and to predict the chemical reactivity in actinide systems. The molecular products are used as starting materials in the low-temperature synthesis of nanoscale actinide clusters and solid-state materials. Both ionic (oxide, fluoride) and covalent (sulfide, selenide, telluride) ligands are incorporated into cluster cores, with chalcogenolate ligands that cap the cluster surface and inhibit the formation of solid-state products. The relationships between the electronic and magnetic properties of actinide molecules, nanoscale clusters, and solid-state materials are defined by measurements on these molecular chalcogenolate and nanoscale products. The multidisciplinary nature of this work affords undergraduate and graduate students an entre to a range of potential career paths."
0.965,"Technical description of the project<br/><br/> This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak and<br/> strong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and<br/> nucleons (particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their<br/> interactions at low energies.

0.09,"A major benefit to undergraduate students pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines, is the opportunity to experience first-hand the application of technology and scientific techniques in real world settings. This project is part of a research program that studies heavy ion collisions within A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The primary goal is to provide students with research experiences that stimulate an interest in science and technology, exposes them to techniques used in experimental high energy physics, allows the development of global relationships and prepares them for careers in science and technology. The project on which the students will work has a focus centered on understanding the behavior of extremely dense matter, similar to that existing a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This is achieved by colliding atomic nuclei at very high energies and studying the remnants of these collisions using highly sophisticated detectors. The students involved in this project will analyze the resulting sub-atomic particles generated by these collisions, and will contribute to the design of new detectors that will enable even more sensitive experiments in the future.<br/><br/>As stated earlier, the focus of ALICE at CERN is to understand the behavior of matter at very high density, similar to the matter that existed a fraction a second after the Big Bang. This state of matter, consisting of a very hot and dense medium of quarks and gluons, is often referred to as a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). By colliding nuclei at very high energies it is possible to create a QGP in a controlled environment that facilitates the study of its properties. Chicago State University (CSU) students will investigate the flavor characteristics, specifically strangeness, of jets resulting from high-energy proton-proton and lead-lead collisions and their use as probes in the study of QGP formation. In addition, CSU students will be involved in a research and development program devoted to the upgrade of ALICE sub-detectors, thereby participating in the hardware development of important components in the ALICE experiment.<br/><br/>Collaboration with a large international laboratory such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN allows students to work with world-class scientists and ""state of the art"" technology, thus preparing them for STEM careers. Additionally, a program such as this has the potential of creating a cadre of students who become ambassadors for STEM; students who demonstrate to their peers the benefits of pursuing careers in science, engineering, math and technology. Also, students who participate in this program may serve as mentors and role models for students of high school age and younger, thereby, contributing to the creation of a pipeline of students actively preparing for careers in STEM."
0.135706,"Muons are very much like the familiar electron, with many of the same characteristics (e.g. intrinsic spin and electric charge) but approximately 200 times more mass. Those similarities and that difference make muons a sensitive tool for exploring new physics and will be exploited in two experiments supported by this award: the MuSun experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Villigen, Switzerland) and on the muon g-2 experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL,, near Chicago). Proton-proton fusion is the initial nuclear reaction in a chain of reactions which are the source of the energy produced by our sun. The rate of this fusion reaction cannot be measured in the laboratory nor has it been calculated from first principles. In the MuSun experiment, muons will be used to study something like proton-proton fusion in reverse. When a muon is captured by a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a neutron and a proton, the deuterium breaks apart into a pair of neutrons and a muon neutrino. The measurement of muon capture by deuterium will provide the necessary information to make possible a first principles calculation. That calculation will also provide a more solid theoretical foundation for the results concerning neutrino characteristics. The new muon g-2 experiment at FNAL aims to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon with unprecedented precision. Because the muon has intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and an electric charge, it also possesses a magnetic moment, that is, it behaves like a tiny magnet. The relationship between the angular momentum and magnetic moment is described by the gyromagnetic ratio or g factor. For the electron and the muon, g is very slightly greater than 2. This difference from 2 is the so-called anomaly. The anomaly, for both electrons and muons, can be measured and calculated with great precision. Any significant disagreement between the two is a hint of new physics.<br/><br/>The technique for measuring the capture rate is simple. Negative muons are stopped in a detector filled with ultra-pure deuterium gas. The experiment will measure the disappearance rate of the muons, similar to any radioactive decay experiment. Because of the capture process, the disappearance rate will be slightly larger than that of free muon decay to electrons plus neutrinos (of both electron and muon types) - the difference is the capture rate. The sensitivity goal of 1.5 percent on the capture rate will require the collection of approximately 20 billion muon disappearance events. To measure the anomaly, muons are injected into a storage ring, a doughnut shaped device, roughly 44 m in circumference, which guides them in roughly circular orbits. As the muons circle the storage ring, their spin vectors, which act like gyroscopes, turn faster than their momentum vectors. The rate of the precession, which is extracted from the time distribution of muon decay electrons, is directly proportional to the anomaly. The experimental goal, a fractional error on the anomaly of approximately one part in ten million, should provide a stringent test of possible new physics."

The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so that the community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online.

0.1242,"Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe and yet we do not know many of their properties. For example, we do not know their absolute mass scale or their particle-antiparticle nature. Because of their abundance, even a small mass could have far-reaching consequences for understanding their role in the evolution of our Universe. Knowing if neutrinos are their own antiparticles could have implications in understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry of our Universe. Neutrino-less double beta decay (NLDBD) experiments address these two fundamental questions. Double beta decay is a rare nuclear decay that has been measured in several nuclei when it is energetically favorable. Some nuclei are stable against ordinary beta decay but are unstable for double beta decay in which two neutrons in the nucleus are simultaneously converted to protons and two electrons are emitted. Double beta decay can proceed through several modes. The experimentally measured process, the two-neutrino mode in which two electron antineutrinos are also emitted, is completely described by known physics. NLDBD is an as-yet-undetected decay that involves no neutrinos in the final state and necessarily would indicate that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. The rate of such decays determines the scale for the effective neutrino mass. <br/><br/>CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is an experiment to search for NLDBD in the isotope 130-Te and is currently being built at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. CUORE is an array of TeO2 crystals used as cryogenic bolometers for the purpose of particle detection. The crystals act as both the source and the absorbing calorimetric material. These kinds of detectors offer good energy resolution and efficiencies and are well-suited for NLDBD searches. <br/><br/>This award will enable the PI to continue to provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate on the CUORE experiment. This will involve tasks such as monitoring the gluing of thermistors and heaters on the 988 crystals, helping to assemble the calibration system and elements of the electronics and assisting with cryostat alignment, with tests of the various subsystems of the detector and with cryostat cool down or warm up diagnostics. This will give students invaluable experience working with a cutting-edge physics experiment in a world-class underground laboratory. <br/><br/>An exciting sector of public outreach that Cal Poly will pursue is to develop an interactive visualization scheme for CUORE physics. This software will serve as a channel for the public to gain insight into the scientific process and explore the mysteries of particle physics. Through Cal Poly's Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education they will help local teachers develop project-based-learning modules for high school physics courses that incorporate the underlying physics of CUORE."
0.5415,"This award will support a program of research in neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD). It has two complementary parts. First is the development of the next-generation CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) detector, including the operations of the first production tower CUORE-0 and the subsequent data analysis. The second goal is the R&D towards a large generic bolometer-based double-beta decay detector. The observation of exotic NDBDs would indicate that neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. they are their own anti-particles. The rate of the process is sensitive to the effective neutrino mass. CUORE promises to be one of the most sensitive NDBD experiments this decade. This group is responsible for providing 1250 Neutron Transmutation Doped (NTD) thermistors that will measure the small temperature rise induced by single decays in the tellurium dioxide crystals. They are performing the quality control measurements of the NTD properties in the newly commissioned cryostat on the Berkeley campus and are also sharing responsibilities for detector assembly and integration. <br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, the group provides a unique educational and research environment for the junior scientists, including graduate and undergraduate students.

0.1,"This theoretical project will support current searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Although the Standard Model has been successful in describing the elementary particles that make up most of known matter in the Universe, many questions still remain unanswered. The theoretical calculations by the investigator and his collaborators will support and suggest new avenues for low-energy experiments sensitive for signatures of new physics. A prominent such example is the proton radius puzzle, where measuring the proton radius using electrons gives different results than using muons. The PI will calculate corrections needed for the interpretation of the data and will study beyond the Standard Model hypotheses to explain the proton radius puzzle, along with suggesting new experiments for future testing of these ideas. Another example is the case of precision electron-proton scattering experiments with polarized electrons, where the PI will do calculations relevant to extensions of the initial experiments that may allow measuring properties of short-lived excited states of the proton and the possibility of comparing them to predictions based on the current theoretical understanding of the physics involved. Postdoctoral fellows and undergraduates will be trained and supported by this project.<br/><br/>One thrust of the project is to find corrections to the energy levels of muonic helium and deuterium due to the polarization of the nuclear cores by the near-by orbiting muons. Precise results are needed to evaluate the measured energy level data and interpret it in terms of radius discrepancies relative to corresponding measurements using electrons. Another thrust is to calculate two photon corrections to polarized electron scattering in the region where the Delta resonance, one of the short-lived proton excitations, exists. To study the Delta as an entity in itself, one produces it using one photon and then measures it almost immediately by a further scattering with a second photon. In this project, the PI will calculate the precision requirements needed to obtain reliably the size and magnetic parameters of the Delta meson."

1.191447,"Proteins perform a variety of biological functions, including muscle contraction and cell division. They are also increasingly used in diverse applications in the biotechnology industry ranging from oil spill cleanup to vaccine delivery. The structure and conformational dynamics (i.e. how their structure changes) of proteins are important properties that govern their function. A critical step in altering or designing proteins with specific novel and desirable properties requires a detailed understanding of how the amino acid sequence of a protein codes for its structural and dynamical properties. This project will test the idea that the patterning and separation of hydrophobic (water repelling) and electrically charged amino acids in the protein plays a significant role in modulating these properties. A variety of spectroscopic techniques (using e.g. light and nuclear magnetic resonance) will be used to determine the changes in structure and stability of these proteins and variants of them that have been specially designed. The experimental studies will be complemented by computer simulations to provide insights at the atomic level into the interplay between hydrophobic and electrical charge interactions. The project aims to substantially advance our understanding of protein folding, one of the most important and complex problems in biology. A new venture into specially designed proteins will test the applicability of principles derived from studies of natural proteins and, it is hoped, will lead to new criteria for the design of proteins with novel and useful properties. This project will involve teaching and training of young scientists, which will be enhanced by active participation in the Protein Folding Consortium.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test the contributions of local-in-sequence and long-range interactions, both in hydrophobic clusters of branched aliphatic side chains and between charged side chains in natural and designed beta/alpha-repeat proteins, in modulating the energy landscape of the proteins. Available evidence on CheY, a naturally occurring protein, suggests that locally connected clusters of isoleucine, leucine and valine side chains rapidly collapse via subdomains that can enhance or impede subsequent folding reactions leading to the native conformation. Recent work on Di-III_14, a de novo designed beta/alpha-repeat protein, suggests that long range electrostatic interactions with high charge segregation are responsible for the formation of very structured intermediates that interconvert extremely slowly with each other and with the native state. The project will extend current knowledge of CheY and Di-III_14 proteins with a battery of spectroscopic methods, at equilibrium and interfaced to ultra-rapid mixing systems, to probe the size, shape and pair-wise distances in the chemically denatured state and in partially folded states that appear in the microsecond time range after dilution to native-favoring conditions. Native-state hydrogen exchange experiments will explore the relationships between partially-folded states and sequence in Di-III_14 and other designed constructs. Mutational analysis will test the role of local and nonlocal ILV clusters and specific electrostatic interactions in the structures formed in high energy states of these proteins, and collaborative single molecule pulling experiments will be used to probe the unique energy surface of Di-III_14 in water. The experimental data will be used to validate collaborative high-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of the folding reactions of CheY and Di-III_14, and new design efforts by collaborators will test the role of charge and charge segregation in molding the free energy surface of beta/alpha-repeat proteins. It is anticipated that the combined application of experimental, computational and design methods to the same targets will substantially enhance our understanding of how sequence determines folding and stability in one of the most common folds in proteins. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."
0.119998,"The subject of functional analysis provides a powerful mathematical language for the investigation of infinite-dimensional structures. The abstract nature of this language allows for a wide spectrum of applications, whose various settings include quantum mechanics, the theory of probability, and the study of systems, physical or otherwise, as they evolve in time. The project will concentrate on several aspects and generalized forms of the last of these three settings, and it will largely revolve around phenomena related to entropy.<br/><br/>Finite or finite-dimensional approximation has long played a fundamental role in both dynamics and operator algebras and is manifest in its most basic and influential forms through the notions of amenability and soficity and their algebraic analogues. In the domain of C*-algebras, amenability has been subject to various refinements like finite decomposition rank and finite nuclear dimension that express the kind of topological regularity necessary for K-theoretic classification theorems within the Elliott program. This project aims to broaden our understanding of the relationships between these regularity properties and phenomena in topological dynamics, in particular mean dimension and Rokhlin-type dimensional invariants, and to test this understanding on a variety of examples that have so far remained beyond the scope of classification, such as actions of branch groups. Combinatorial independence will be brought into this picture as a tool for analyzing mixing and paradoxicality in dynamics and their relation to quasidiagonality and dimensional behavior, and it will be also applied to actions of sofic groups in the study of entropy and orbit equivalence."
0.244822,"Part 1<br/><br/>Changes of a galaxy's properties over time are driven by the quantity of its cold gas, the raw material from which stars form. Thus, understanding the properties of a galaxy's cold gas component will tell us both how the star formation process changes over time and how this affects galaxies. Using a recently completed survey of carbon monoxide gas in a sample of nearby galaxies, the proposers will (1) measure how the molecular gas is used up, in order to test how star formation in the galaxies is affected; (2) map the locations of this gas in the galaxies to determine if/how these locations affect star formation; and (3) measure how the gas is flowing into and out of the galaxies to determine how this affects structural changes in the galaxies over time. In particular, some questions that can be answered from this research include: What factors affect the conversion of molecular gas into stars? How is molecular gas structured? How do galaxies grow and age? This proposal will provide insight into the process of galaxy formation and our understanding of these objects.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>This proposal plans to combine spatially resolved spectroscopy of carbon monoxide molecular gas, ionized gas and stellar populations for a sample of 125 nearby galaxies. Measuring spatially-resolved molecular gas depletion time scales as a function of various galaxy properties, using diagnostics of spectral lines to probe diffuse molecular gas, and constraining the rates of gas in- and outflow for these galaxies has the potential to add greatly to our understanding of star formation in normal galaxies.<br/><br/>Observations of galaxies across a range of redshifts allow us to witness the growth and aging of the galaxy population. It has long been recognized that these processes are driven by the rise and fall of star formation, which is ultimately linked to the supply of cold gas. Further progress in understanding the regulation of star formation in galaxies, however, requires additional observational constraints beyond the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By exploiting a unique combination of the largest, most homogeneous interferometric CO survey of galaxies to date (the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution, or EDGE) and one of the principal ongoing optical integral field unit (IFU) surveys (CALIFA), the project team will confront models of star formation and galaxy evolution with uniform, high quality measurements of gas masses and star formation rates, supplemented by a vast array of additional data, including star formation history, stellar mass, nuclear activity, and the metallicity and kinematics of the gas and stars. These studies will be conducted on a spatially resolved basis across a well-defined sample that is representative of the nearby Universe, and will thus inform future studies of star formation and mass assembly at all redshifts undertaken by JWST and ALMA."
0.374152,"The origin of matter is one of the great puzzles of nature. Even though the visible component is only a small part of the mass/energy balance of the universe the strong force that permanently confines quarks and gluons to atomic nuclei remains mysterious. Understanding of the phenomenon of confinement is one of the fundamental questions in physics. Protons, neutrons and other hadrons are the bound states of quarks and gluons allowed by confinement. This project will pursue studies of individual hadrons and their interaction and is expected to offer a unique window into this fundamental phenomenon. In the process, this project will enable best practice spectroscopy analysis across a broad range of forthcoming experiments, particularly at the Jefferson Laboratory. Education activities are an integral part of this effort. Students will have ample training opportunities and will acquire computational and analytical skills that will serve them well in their future careers in the industry or academia. A vibrant set of summer undergraduate research experiences will be hosted by the investigators at the Jefferson Laboratory with both computer science and particle physics projects.<br/><br/>Developments in particle accelerators and detection techniques have led to a new generation of experiments in hadron physics that are flourishing around the world. An important set of experiments studies hadron spectroscopy, what hadrons exist and with what properties. The new experiments at these facilities generate complicated data sets, which demand a qualitatively new level of sophistication in analysis never achieved before. The objective of the project is to develop new theoretical tools and underlying computational services for analysis of large statistics data sets from current and future experiments in hadron spectroscopy with the goal to search for new hadrons, in particular the so called, hybrids and glueballs, which are expected to carry some unique signatures of the confinement phenomenon. The unique features of the underlying theory of strong interactions also make it an attractive template for constructing theories beyond the Standard Model of fundamental interaction. This project will enable such work."
0.458,"Every eukaryotic cell contains a copy of the genome in its nucleus, but only a subset of genes is turned on in any given cell at any given time. Proper regulation of genes is critical in development and basic biological function from the cellular to organismal level. The eukaryotic genome exists in complex with proteins called histones. The histone/DNA complex is called chromatin and is composed of repeating subunits called nucleosomes. Each nucleosome looks like a spool wrapped with string in which the histones form the spool and a segment of genomic DNA is the string. It is the way in which the DNA wraps the histone core (called nucleosome structure) and the organization of the nucleosomes with respect to each other that allows or restricts access to the underlying genome, determining patterns of gene expression. This project addresses the fundamental questions of how patterns of small chemical tags, termed post-translational modification (PTM), are read-out by other proteins associated with chromatin (called co-factors) and how this association may alter nucleosome structure to affect precise regulation of downstream events. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to study a variety of nucleosome constructs to determine how a specific model transcription factor associates with a nucleosome containing different patterns of PTMs and how this association alters the nucleosome structure and its dynamic behavior at atomic resolution.<br/><br/>This project supports the education and training of undergraduate and pre-and post-doctoral students both in the classroom via courses instructed by the PI, as well as in the laboratory in which they will carry out the project goals. In addition, the research team will partner with the Iowa-based non-profit organization, the Workplace Learning Connection, to establish an internship program in the laboratory for high school students. Students in from Iowa City and surrounding counties will gain 45-90 hours of laboratory experience, working on various aspects of the project for which they will receive high school credit. This program will provide students with a tangible research experience in the basic sciences, and will also allow the PI to establish mentoring relationships with them that are expected to last well beyond their time in the laboratory. The investigator will continue these activities to contribute towards increased participation in STEM areas, which is imperative for the growth and stability of the United States economy as well as our global competitiveness.<br/><br/>Technical: The main objective of the proposed research is to understand the fundamental and biologically important mechanisms by which histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin structure. The investigator and her students will utilize NMR spectroscopy and other biochemical and biophysical methods to investigate the interaction of a model system, the BPTF PHD-finger-Bromodomain motif with modified nucleosomes. The investigators hope to understand, in detail, how a multi-domain motif recognizes PTMs at the level of the nucleosome, especially how distinct patterns of PTMs across multiple histone tails are specifically read out. In addition, through measurement of NMR relaxation parameters, they will address the important questions of how histone modifications and effector domain binding regulate the conformational dynamics of the nucleosome, likely stabilizing or destabilizing conformational states that may be essential for downstream function. This research will be fully integrated with a plan for education outreach, focused on sparking interest of high school students in STEM fields."

0.48,"This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics. A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes. These processes are primary targets for gravitational wave detectors now being deployed, like LIGO, and there is an urgent need for reliable waveforms. The investigators will use a computational technique, pseudospectral collocation, that delivers high accuracy with a much smaller computational cost than other techniques.<br/>Other applications will include benchmarking of analytical approximations, such as the post-Newtonian and Effective One Body techniques; computations in difficult regimes of parameter space such as high spins and mass ratios; and analytical explorations of the numerical spacetimes to improve our understanding of strong field gravity. A second focus of the research is to study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and a black hole, or two neutron stars. These are also prime scientific targets for LIGO. The investigators will include ever more realistic descriptions of the microphysics in the simulations, such as the equation of state of nuclear matter, neutrino effects,and magnetic fields.<br/><br/>This research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will have an impact on astronomy. Mergers of compact binaries containing neutron stars may lead to the emission of electromagnetic and neutrino signals, opening the possibility of concurrently observing such events in multiple ways leading to greater understanding of such events. Simulations carried out by this project will help determine what signals to look for and how to interpret them when they are detected. The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand."

0.334586,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The objective of this work is to understand the fundamental mechanisms through which mobile twin boundaries (TBs) actively engage and rapidly remove stacking fault tetrahedra (SFTs). The ultimate goal is to design advanced metallic materials that can effectively remove SFTs at low-to-intermediate temperatures. SFTs are detrimental defects in neutron or proton irradiated structural metallic materials with face-centered-cubic structures as they can induce significant hardening and swelling. The PI will use a combination of in situ radiation and in situ nanoindentation technique to investigate the interaction of SFTs with TBs. These studies can explain the annihilation of SFTs by TBs and provide crucial information to validate annihilation mechanisms predicted by MD simulations. Also significant mobility of TBs may make them attractive candidates to remove radiation induced immobile defects, such as SFTs. <br/><br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>If successful, the benefits of this research will include discovery of important criteria for the design of swelling resistant structural materials for next generation nuclear reactors, and offer the basis for further exploration of physics of radiation induced twin boundary migrations. This project will provide research training to graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University (TAMU). Special effort will be made to recruit female and other minority students through the ""Pathway to Ph.D program"" funded by TAMU. The project will also enhance the materials science and nanoengineering curricula by incorporating relevant results into classes when introducing advanced nanomaterials, and benefit the new formed Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The PI will disseminate results to a much broader audience by involving high school teachers in the research project through NSF-RET program, and attending international conferences. Collaborations with McMaster University and several DOE National Laboratories will offer graduate students summer research experience."

This award support research to investigate geographic origins and evolutionary relationships of Asian Iris. The project will focus on series Chinensis, small irises that are distributed mainly in northeast China, but also found in Korea and Japan. The number of species in the series is unknown because authors have not agreed on the inclusion of some species. Our understanding of the distribution of these and other Chinese species is limited because recent systematic work in Asia has focused on the Flora of China project, which surveyed existing databases from major Chinese herbaria to produce an overall account of taxa present.

0.42,"In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Tianbo Liu of the University of Akron explores the solution properties of macroions. These macroions are between 1 and 10 nanometers (nm) in size and represent a missing link between simple ions and large colloids. The project aims to explore the microscopic features of macroions and their interactions with local environments, that is, the counterions, the co-ions, and the layered structures they make in water. These interactions are being explored in order to unveil the fundamental reasons behind the unique solution properties of the macroions such as their self-assembly into blackberry-like structures. The blackberry formation process is found to mimic the virus capsid formation process. This research could have broad impacts on other fields, such as physical chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, biochemistry, materials sciences and nanotechnology. The project involves training graduate and undergraduate students, and encouraging high school students to participate in national science competitions and scientific careers. The research infrastructure is being enhanced through scientific collaborations.<br/><br/>The research has three complementary components. First, the macroion-counterion interaction is being characterized by determining the radial distributions of counterions around macroions and the stability of the macroions in the presence of an excess number of counterions. Secondly, the effect of co-ions on the macroions are being examined, particularly for the preferential interactions between chiral macroions and chiral co-ions. Third, the detailed changes of surface water structures of both counterions and macroions during their interaction are being studied. Relatively simple models, mainly polyoxometalate clusters and metal-organic nanocages, are employed for the study. The solution studies employ a combination of techniques, such as static and dynamic laser light scattering, synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, isothermal titration, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy, and Zeta potential analysis. The conclusions are expected to be universal and may be instructive for understanding more complex systems such as polyelectrolyte and biomacromolecular solutions."
0.75939,"In this study, researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will conduct the first systematic and coherent global-scale analysis of a considerable dataset of ocean tritium/helium-3 observations, and integrate findings into a global Earth System Model. Nuclear weapons tests in the late 1950s and early 1960s released into the atmosphere approximately 400 kilograms of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. A large fraction of the tritium entered the Northern Hemisphere surface ocean via precipitation. The subsequent movement of tritium and helium-3 (produced when tritium undergoes radioactive decay) in the oceans has served as a powerful tracer of ocean circulation and mixing. For the past four decades, field measurements of the tritium/helium-3 ratio in worldwide oceanic waters have been collected, amassing more than 20,000 samples in the North Atlantic alone. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of oxygen and nutrient dynamics in the oceans, and will add new capabilities to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) ocean model, which is widely used for ocean physical, biogeochemical, and ecological research as well as climate change research. The researchers will also incorporate the results of the study into a graduate-level course. <br/><br/>Tritium released into the oceans has been a powerful tracer of ocean subduction, circulation, and mixing in the thermocline and newly formed deep and intermediate waters. Tritium also acts as a chemically and biologically inert analogue for nutrients and a unique tracer allowing the tracking and quantification of nutrient upwelling pathways and biological new production. This study will provide a synthesis of ocean tritium/helium-3 observations for the North Atlantic and North Pacific, bringing together more than four decades of field observations into a single, publicly available dataset. Oceanographic data analysis techniques combined with diagnostic and inverse modeling then will be used to estimate physical and biogeochemical rates. Tritium/helium-3 simulations from an advanced 3-D ocean circulation model will be used to resolve issues involving regional/temporal data gaps, physical transport mechanisms, and biogeochemical assumptions used in the diagnostic modeling. Overall results of the study will be a characterization of the spatial and temporal evolution of ocean tritium, a better understanding of oxygen utilization rates, and combined surface tritium data with subsurface tritium:nutrient distributions."

The RCN builds off the NSF SEES Workshop -Tracking an energy elephant: science and engineering challenges for unlocking the geothermal potential of sedimentary basins,- which was held November 2011 in Salt Lake City. This workshop included 71 participants, and was convened to address the question ""What are the basic science and engineering questions that need to be addressed in order to make geothermal energy production from sedimentary basins practical?"" The November 2011 SEES Workshop concluded that geothermal energy from sedimentary basins has the realistic potential to supply energy on the gigawatt scales of coal and nuclear. The barriers to sedimentary-basin geothermal are within the risk and uncertainty of economic extraction. Addition of sedimentary-basin geothermal to the U.S. energy portfolio would have a tremendous impact on the sustainability of the energy grid and the economy at large with negligible environmental impact.

0.61152,"Intellectual merit:<br/>The structure of chromatin, the complex of genomic DNA and proteins found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, governs cellular processes including DNA replication, transcription and post-transcriptional gene regulation. But, how that is accomplished is an important question that remains to be clearly elucidated. In mammalian cells, chromosomal domains occupy a specific nuclear position and replicate at defined times during S-phase of the cell division cycle. The spatiotemporal pattern of DNA replication within a given cell type is heritable and is established during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. There is, however, minimal understanding of the events and molecules that govern the spatiotemporal patterning of DNA replication. The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) plays critical roles in the initiation of DNA replication, chromatin organization and cell cycle progression. The binding of the largest subunit of human ORC, Orc1 to chromatin is an obligatory step for pre-RC assembly during G1. Similarly, Orc2-5 display dynamic association with chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The interplay between ORC and chromatin structure that govern replication timing and patterning remain to be elucidated. The objective of the present project is to determine how ORC contributes to and/or reads epigenetic marks during G1. The project will address the role of ORC in establishing spatial patterning and timing of replication in G1 and determine the role of chromatin architecture in modulating ORC binding to chromatin. This research is innovative in its combination of molecular biology and biochemistry with state of the art live cell imaging. This project is highly significant as it aims to advance our understanding of how chromatin organization and replication are coordinated in living cells.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>This research will have a strong and active outreach potential, since it utilizes extensive high-resolution microscopy as well as time-lapse live cell imaging that is crucial not only to understand key biological questions on replication, but also to serve as a platform for undergraduate students to appreciate biology. This approach will be applied in several ways including by teaching undergraduate students, by providing research opportunities to University of Illinois and community college students, by mentoring future researchers, and by organizing a symposium for students to appreciate the excitement of basic research. These activities will all involve women and minority students. This project integrates the use of Biochemistry, Cell Biology and Molecular Biology to capture the interest of students from varied backgrounds, including Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Bioengineering. With a small investment of time, exposing young and bright students to research early on in life will be highly beneficial and instill in them a sense of scientific awareness."
0.3,"The objective of this project is to link the chemical composition and molecular structure of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) to the viscoelastic mechanical properties of the material. C-S-H is the main binding hydration product of portland cement that governs properties of concrete. If alumina is available during the production of C-S-H, typically from alumino-silicate supplementary cementitious materials, C-S-H is able to incorporate aluminum as a guest ion, producing a calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C-A-S-H). Alumina incorporation is seen to alter its molecular structure by increasing the tetrahedral chain length, a change that is seen to promote crosslinking between C-S-H layers. By applying a multiscale static and dynamic mechanical testing that include a novel nanomechanical characterization technique of dynamic nanoindentation, the main hypothesis that will be tested during this project is to determine whether C-A-S-H is less viscoelastic than C-S-H due to this increased polymerization. To relate chemical composition and molecular structure with viscoelastic properties, phase-pure C-S-H and C-A-S-H will be synthesized in the lab with varying composition and characterized using advanced techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for local atomic environment, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for detection of crystalline phases, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for bulk chemical composition. Furthermore, a combination of NMR characterization before and after mechanical testing will indicate if there are any changes in molecular structure during viscoelastic deformation, knowledge that will be transformative.<br/><br/>If the hypothesis that alumina substitution in C-S-H reduces creep is proved right, this research will lead to a new method of controlling the viscoelasticity of concrete that can ultimately lead to longer life of concrete structures. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world and production of it is associated with approximately 5% of the global CO2 emissions. Thus, any increase in the longevity of concrete structure will mean reduction in the amount of concrete produced and associated greenhouse gas emission. In addition, the main source of alumina in C-S-H is usually fly ash, a waste material that also reduces the portland cement content in concrete and thereby reduces its greenhouse gas emission. The research is well integrated with educational plans, including (a) training graduate student in advanced chemo-mechanical characterization of materials at multiscale, (b) incorporating research findings into graduate level classes, and (c) generating enthusiasm for engineering and sustainable construction among talented middle school students."

The primary science driver for this experiment is to discover millisecond pulsars to add to the NANOGrav (North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves) pulsar timing array for gravitational wave detection. The survey will also discover exotic binary systems, transient pulsars, and other classes of transient sources. Roughly 20% of the sky has already been covered in the first phase of this survey, with 11 new pulsars discovered through processing 5% of these data. Simulations suggest that the full survey will discover 50?100 millisecond pulsars and about 200 normal pulsars.<br/><br/>The direct detection of gravitational waves is one of the foremost goals of modern physics and may offer unique insights into galaxy formation, the early stages of the universe, and even cosmic strings. Finding new, high-precision millisecond pulsars to add to pulsar timing arrays will facilitate the principal goals of this project. The survey will likely detect pulsars in exotic binary systems which will provide tests of general relativity and probe extreme density nuclear physics. The survey will be sensitive to transient signals that will permit exploration of the full range of pulsar intermittency and discover completely new astrophysical phenomena. Furthermore, all of the new pulsars discovered will be useful for improving our understanding of the properties of the nearby, local pulsar population. With support from this award, this group will create undergraduate fellowship programs at West Virginia University and the University of Virginia that will allow students to participate in survey observations, processing, and follow-up. These programs are expected to increase retention of students in science and engineering majors and offer both undergraduate and graduate students peer-mentoring opportunities."

0.497709,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Production of concrete based on Portland cement hydration is an energy intensive process responsible for a staggering 5-8% of the annual global CO2 emissions. The concretes of ancient Roman monuments and seawater harbors, produced from volcanic rocks and hydrated lime, have a far smaller CO2 footprint than conventional Portland cement concretes, far greater chemical and mechanical resistance to decay, and take a smaller energy budget to produce. The secret to the environmental sustainability of the 2000-year old concretes is traced to the chemical nature of the mortar binder. The goal of the project is to gain a fundamental understanding of this chemistry. The broader impact of this work lies in its positive contributions to interdisciplinary science, society, and educational and outreach activities. The research will provide guideposts for greater sustainability of our resources (both energy and clean water) and future applications to high performance concretes, as well as to increased durability of Portland cement concretes blended with environmentally-friendly supplemental materials, and including seawater, which conserves fresh water resources. From a societal perspective, the research has the potential to transform traditional concepts of the concrete industry based on Portland cement hydration, to binding mechanisms inherent in naturally-occurring volcanic ash deposits. The results may also be of value in developing improved methods for conservation of ancient structures and more recent concrete structures. From an economic perspective, it will contribute to ""green"" construction, an important growth sector of the national economy. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project aims to gain a fundamental understanding of the hydration mechanisms, binding mechanisms, cation exchange properties, and nanoscale mechanical properties of 2000-year old cementitious components of Roman concretes. The research is based on a nanostructural approach that focusses on thin, intact slices of mortars, already prepared from the Baianus Sinus breakwater (first century BC) in Pozzuoli Bay near Naples, Italy, and reproductions of these materials prepared with Campi Flegrei volcanic ash. The primary analytical techniques include X-ray microdiffraction (to identify crystalline phases), Raman spectroscopy (for structural and vibrational properties and bonding environment characterization), nuclear magnetic resonance (for Si-O and Al-O bonding environments), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (for detailed nanostructural studies), nanoindentation to assess mechanical properties of these phases (modulus, hardness, strength) with nanoscale resolution, and engineering strength and durability testing for the mortar reproductions. It is anticipated that this research will result in new formulations of high performance concretes with a lifetime improvement of over one order of magnitude, and in new processes designed specifically for reduced waste product, especially CO2 emissions, and for much higher energy efficiency than current processes. A significant impact of this project is in education, in particular by training graduate and undergraduate students in several disciplinary areas: materials science, earth science, archaeological science, and civil engineering."

0.258049,"The principal aim of this CAREER: Energy-Efficient Datacenters with Wireless Interconnection Networks project is to establish design principals of a wireless datacenter by integrating intra- and inter-chip wireless networks. Computing machinery around the world consumes staggering amounts of energy. According to the NY Times in September 2012, digital warehouses like datacenters use thirty billion watts of electricity, which is equivalent to the output of thirty nuclear power plants. Networked computing elements are omnipresent in all computing machinery like datacenters, servers and High Performance Computing (HPC). Tens to thousands of multicore chips are interconnected to form an entire datacenter making the role of the network paramount in the performance and energy efficiency of the entire system.<br/><br/>Data transfer between cores or memory components in different chips in large computing machinery need to traverse various interconnection technologies at the different levels of the network, often requiring change of switching protocols thus resulting in overheads. More importantly, according to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), the pitch of the interchip interconnects is not scaling as fast as the pitch of on-chip interconnects, resulting in a performance gap in the future. Additionally, the wiring complexity of both on-chip and off-chip interconnects exacerbates the problem by posing design challenges, crosstalk and signal integrity issues. Recent research envisions on-chip wireless interconnects using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) technologies for designing Network-on-Chips, which are significantly more energy-efficient compared to traditional architectures. On the other hand in recent years considerable research has been done to develop wireless datacenters using the same 60GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. The integrated architecture proposed in this work will be capable of establishing wireless routes between communicating processing cores in a datacenter.<br/><br/>This highly interdisciplinary project will engage experts from the disciplines of computer engineering, computer science and electrical engineering from both academia and industry. Using concepts and technologies from various domains like computer architecture, communication, integrated circuit packaging and datacenters, the project will establish methodologies for wireless interconnections in large-scale computing warehouses to decrease their energy consumption and carbon footprint, ultimately resulting in a green and sustainable computing paradigm."

Experiments have become more and more accurate, testing the theory at a stronger and stronger level. This supplies a test of our understanding of the physics of these systems. This project will calculate energy levels for systems where there have been discrepancies between theory and experiment. The theoretical results obtained in this research will find applications in the analysis of the forthcoming experimental results on muonic and electronic atoms and ions. This analysis will result in more precise values of the fundamental physical constants, especially the proton radius, as well as radii of the deuteron and alpha particles. These values will find applications in metrology and nuclear physics. New theoretical expressions will be used in the new CODATA analysis of the fundamental physical constants. In its turn CODATA compilations of the fundamental constants are used in every science classroom, and in numerous fields of science and engineering, from fundamental research to consumer electronics.

Search for a theoretical explanation of the discrepancy between the value of the proton charge radius obtained from the experiment with muonic hydrogen and the proton charge radius derived from hydrogen spectroscopy and electron-proton scattering is one of the main objectives. Irrespective of the way the proton charge radius controversy will be resolved, an extensive program of research on energy splittings in light muonic atoms and ions (muonic hydrogen, muonic deuterium, and muonic helium ions) is in order to match current and forthcoming experimental results.

0.49,"Non-technical abstract<br/>Living matter can change its structure as it responds to changes in its environment. With support from the Solid-State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the goal of this research is to replicate this type of responsiveness using artificial materials that can reconfigure themselves in response to an external stimulus, in this case light. Reconfigurable matter consists of a structure composed of smaller elements whose properties can be switched by light. After switching, these elements can reassemble into a new composite structure that has different properties. Many workers in the field envision the switchable elements to be nanoparticles or colloids, but it is clear that the smallest switchable element is a molecule. A molecule that undergoes a photochemical reaction represents a switchable element. A crystal composed of photoreactive molecules can then restructure itself after exposure to light. This proposal is concerned with the development of molecular crystal materials that can undergo photoinduced shape changes as a route to reconfigurable matter. Materials that undergo structural changes in response to light have potential applications a wide range of disciplines ranging from engineering to medicine to cell biology.

First, new materials and approaches to molecular crystal-based photoinduced motion will be developed. This motion usually originates from the presence of a mixture of reactant and product molecules within the crystal that form a bimorph structure. New halogenated anthracene derivatives will be synthesized to improve the robustness and reversibility of the [4+4] photodimerization reaction that powers the crystal mechanical response. New types of photochemical reactions based on the unimolecular cis-trans isomerization of divinyl(anthracene) derivatives will also be explored. The materials development will include efforts to develop novel micron-scale crystal morphologies that can give rise to new modes of mechanical response. A second area of focus will be to improve the physical understanding of the photomechanical response by studying its mechanism and limits. By measuring how light intensity, direction, wavelength, and crystal shape affect the rate and magnitude of crystal bending, different theories proposed to explain the mechanical response can be evaluated. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments will measure spin diffusion dynamics to assess whether the reactions proceed homogeneously throughout the crystal or heterogeneously with domain formation. These experiments will provide information on both the size and shape of nanoscale domains that grow during the photochemical reaction. Third, we will prepare arrays of nanocrystals that can reshape themselves after exposure to light. Surface patterning followed by microdrop printing will generate separated nanocrystals composed of photoreactive molecules. These crystal arrays will be characterized by optical spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy. Photoinduced shape changes will be measured and correlated with starting crystal shape and size, as well as light exposure."
0.019982,"This project investigates the conditions under which past experiences of protracted risk influence local assessments and policy formulation. Risk is a theme of growing importance both for the sciences and within social and political life, most typically used to describe an orientation toward the future as something open to human intervention. Most risk assessment analyses rely on data from contexts where risk is experienced as a single event from which a set of costs and benefits are to be assessed. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how understandings of risk assessment vary in contexts with a long history of risk management. Findings from this case study will further contribute to public understandings of risk distribution and its implications for public health, policy discussions regarding environmental regulation, and ongoing educational efforts in Baltimore (where the researcher will involve students in the research process and contribute research materials to local archives).<br/><br/>George Washington University graduate student Chloe Ahmann (under the direction of Dr. Joel Kuipers) will study one Baltimore City community where residents are debating the construction of a trash-burning incinerator in order to understand, first, how past exposure to toxins affects individuals' experience of risk and, second, how such experience can motivate collective mobilization. South Baltimore City has been a site of risk management since the 19th century, from quarantining lepers during the ""great wave"" of immigration to supporting nuclear deterrence with its Cold War chemical holdings. These operations have left significant marks on both land and local health. Today, the region is the planned site of the nation's largest incinerator. While political representatives have supported the project as an ""acceptable risk"" on the path toward energy independence, residents have responded by invoking their historical exposure to risk. In order to understand the historical and toxicological motivations for this, the researcher will conduct both archival and ethnographic research, by (1) tracing histories of risk management that have affected south Baltimore and interrogating their cumulative effects and (2) exploring how residents use this history to make political claims in the present. In doing so, her project will not only contribute to research on environmental justice movements, but will also increase understandings of how history influences experiences of risk more generally (for example, in health, security, and finance). The project will rely on methodological frameworks grounded in actor network theory and new social movement, and make use of conventional methods of ethnographic data collection and analysis, including participant observation within the Baybrook community, oral history, and semi-structured interviews."

0.342505,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Intermetallic phases are a class of metals and alloys that exhibit a vast range of materials behaviors valuable for technological applications. Examples include the catalysis of reactions for chemical synthesis or energy generation, the conversion of temperature gradients into electrical energy, the maintenance of strong and permanent magnetic moments, and the ability to recover an original geometry after drastic mechanical deformations. A pressing problem is relating these desirable behaviors to the often complex atomic arrangements within intermetallics, the solution to which could allow rational approaches to enhancing these properties. The focus of this research supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in the Division of Materials Research is the development of such connections between atomic arrangements and materials behavior for intermetallics. Theoretical methods are used to make predictions about atomic geometries within these compounds, the physical properties arising from these structures, and their responses to changes in pressure or temperature. Experiments involving the creation of new materials and the measurement of their properties are then used to test these predictions and revise the theoretical models. In addition, this project involves the development of resources for teaching solid state and materials chemistry, a subject typically underrepresented in the undergraduate curriculum. New content is being developed for the online textbook Interactive Solid State Chemistry, which harnesses the interactive capabilities of the webpage format to enhance students' experience of the material. This resource is available to a broad range of educators and students through its inclusion as a Living Textbook in the Chemical Education Digital Library, a pathway in the National Science Digital Library. Interest and awareness of materials chemistry is also promoted through the production of Science Through Comics, a website in which aspects of the field are illustrated in a non-technical and humorous way. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Intermetallic phases comprise a broad family of solid state materials that are remarkable for both their structural diversity and rich range of physical properties. Intermetallics thus show great promise for materials design efforts, in which structural features are adjusted for the optimization of particular properties. A limiting factor in realizing this potential, however, is the need for clear relationships between their often complex atomic arrangements and the physical properties they exhibit. Under prior NSF support, a theoretical method was developed that offers a way of bridging these aspects of intermetallics: Chemical Pressure (CP) analysis. In this approach, the output of density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to construct maps of the local pressures within solid state structures, which reveal how conflicts between electronic interactions and atomic packing constraints underlie a broad range of structural phenomena in metallic phases. In this project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program, the CP approach is built into a predictive conceptual framework that accounts not only for structural trends within intermetallics, but also their properties and phase transitions at high temperatures and pressures. The ultimate goal of this research is a unified understanding of structures and properties in intermetallics, which can be applied in materials design. Progress toward this aim is being achieved through three subprojects adapting the DFT-CP method to experimental design: (1) the synthetic exploration of new structural chemistry driven by CP relief, (2) the development and validation of principles connecting structure to vibrational properties, which in turn influence such physical properties as thermal stability, thermal conductivity, and superconductivity, and (3) the discovery of new pressure-induced structural transformations. The first subproject involves the synthesis in intermetallic systems motivated by CP calculations, the determination of newly encountered structures, and the use of data-mining and theory to place these structures into family trees whose branches represent pathways for CP release. The second and third subprojects leverage expertise and facilities available at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory for Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (NRIXS) and high pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements, respectively, to verify the predictions of theory."

Such characteristics are likely responsible, in part, for present patterns of biodiversity in and around the Sichuan Basin. While the landscape characteristics of neighboring regions have been recognized and studied as factors shaping biodiversity, the Sichuan Basin has received little attention regarding its role in influencing the distribution of species in this region. The White-browed Laughingthrush (Garrulax sannio) is both abundant and widely distributed throughout much of southern Asia, making this species an appropriate model organism with which to conduct this project. This research, which will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Longyin Wen and LeShan Normal University, will use the analysis of DNA samples from various populations throughout the range of G. sannio to assess the relatedness among populations. In addition, environmental niche models will be generated to show both the modern day distribution, as well as historic distribution of this species. This research is important because, in a world facing challenges related to climate change, it is necessary to understand how landscape features may influence species? response. The results of this project will allow researchers to anticipate species? response to future climate fluctuations and guide researchers and managers through more efficient and influential management practices and ultimately help conserve species diversity.<br/><br/>Geographic complexities have influenced the evolution of distinct lineages by periodically isolating populations during historical climatic fluctuations. The Sichuan Basin is a globally recognized biodiverse eco-region characterized as a continental island isolated by mountainous topography. Such geo-physical complexity creates a unique landscape feature that has likely facilitated the present patterns of biodiversity in and around the Sichuan Basin. While the topography of neighboring regions has been recognized as factors shaping biodiversity, the Sichuan Basin has received little attention regarding its role in influencing local biogeographic patterns. The White-browed Laughingthrush (Garrulax sannio) is both abundant and widely distributed throughout much of southern Asia, making this species an appropriate model organism to demonstrate the role of the Sichuan Basin in influencing biogeographic patterns in this region. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA will be used investigate the genetic structure and estimate periods of historical isolation among populations of G. sannio in and around the Sichuan Basin. Contemporary and paleo-distribution models will be generated to estimate periods of range expansion and contraction and demonstrate periods of historical isolation among populations. This research is in collaboration with Dr. Longyin Wen and LeShan Normal University, and will provide the scientific community with a better understanding of the factors shaping contemporary biogeographic patterns while allowing for predictions toward species? response to future climate fluctuations providing us with the tools to maintain biodiversity in one of the world?s most biologically rich regions. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China."
0.764999,"As we face the twin challenges of increased population growth and climate change it is important to understand how plants can survive water stress (drought). Plants as sessile organisms have to continuously defend themselves against environmental stresses and optimal stress responses are critical for survival, reproduction and crop yield. Stress responses require reprogramming of gene expression. Additionally, gene expression changes need to be rapid and reversible. This project will investigate how the essential Polycomb gene silencing mechanism contributes to plant water stress response and whether rapid synthesis of a class of non-expressed RNA molecules directs the Polycomb silencing machinery to the appropriate genes to be silenced. The project will provide insight into how plant drought responses can be enhanced and will provide authentic research experiences for undergraduate and high school students. Undergraduate students will participate in experimental research in laboratory courses and in the research laboratory using state-of-the-art experimental approaches. Students will design experiments, implement procedures and learn to communicate about science. Formative and summative assessments will help improve the efficacy of the laboratory course. Related high school laboratory exercises will be developed and PI Wagner will give lectures and workshops to high school students about this project during summer research academies.<br/><br/>In recent years it has become apparent that the majority of the genome is transcribed as noncoding transcripts, the roles of which are poorly understood. RNA abundance can change more rapidly than protein abundance, making lncRNAs ideally suited to direct chromatin regulatory complexes to new sites in the genome in response to environmental cues. This project will identify lncRNAs that recruit Polycomb complexes to new loci upon water stress sensing using four complementary approaches. First, regions to which Polycomb complexes are rapidly recruited and that are silenced upon water stress sensing will be defined by genomic approaches. Second, lncRNAs that specifically associate with the Polycomb complexes in response to the stress will be identified by combined biochemical and high-throughput sequencing approaches. Third, nuclear protein-bound lncRNA will be identified whose abundance increases under stress conditions by high-throughput sequencing. Finally, Polycomb-associated lnRNAs that increase in abundance upon stress sensing will be tested for biological roles in plant stress response and in Polycomb recruitment using reverse genetic approaches. Findings from this study will significantly enhance understanding of Polycomb recruitment, lncRNA function and transcriptional reprogramming during water stress response. The results ultimately will enable us to modulate chromatin regulatory complex recruitment to enhance desirable traits in plants such as tolerance to drought and other stresses.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."
0.513196,"Title: Accounting for Conformational Dynamics in Post-Translational Phosphorylation of Signaling Proteins<br/><br/>To thrive, cells must regulate dense networks of protein-protein interactions that drive basic processes such as cell growth, division, and death. One well-known regulatory mechanism is ""post-translational phosphorylation"" - the reversible addition of phosphate groups to specific amino acids within a protein. Phosphorylation can alter protein binding specificity, enzymatic activity, or sub-cellular location, thereby regulating its interaction with other proteins. But just how this comes about is not yet clear. In fact, an atomic level explanation for how site-specific phosphorylation changes a protein's interaction properties remains an open challenge. This project addresses this challenge by investigating the effects of post-translational phosphorylation on protein conformational dynamics. The protein segments subject to phosphorylation are often the same segments involved in intermolecular interactions. Critically, they often have conformational flexibility that defies explanation by standard biochemical analysis. By investigating how these dynamic protein segments convert phosphorylation into functional change, this project will provide insight into a widespread, yet poorly understood aspect of protein phosphorylation. Gaining this insight is a necessary step toward understanding and manipulating protein interaction networks. This project will bring interdisciplinary educational opportunities to students at early stages of college by developing freshmen courses that introduce physical principles based on biophysical phenomena. This project will also train doctoral students and undergraduate research interns, including members of underrepresented groups, to become highly qualified scientists in the area biophysics and computational biology; the cultivation of such expertise is vital to keep the U.S. competitiveness in research and in the global economy.<br/><br/>The project will combine liquid-state multi-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and mutagenesis to map how site-specific phosphorylation impacts protein dynamics and protein-substrate interactions in the mitotic signaling protein, Pin1. Pin1 interactions with other proteins are sensitive to both conformational dynamics and post-translational phosphorylation. This proposal will determine the extent to which phosphorylation exploits electrostatic networks to achieve long-range site-to-site communication (allostery). This project will also define how phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered regions nevertheless elicit functional changes at remote binding sites. Because Pin1 interacts with numerous other signaling proteins, results of this project will give broad insight into the mechanisms by which dynamic protein segments convert phosphorylation into functional change. This project will also include development of general protein NMR methods to better characterize dynamic electrostatic interactions in proteins, and their description in terms of conformational ensembles. This project is supported by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences."
0.809189,"Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics) is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments that acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. These experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics: What are the underlying constituents of matter? And how do they interact? With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics is complete. It provides an excellent description of known particles and forces. However, the most interesting questions remain open: What is the dark matter which pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the mechanism stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum corrections? The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale data samples to provide answers. Analyzing this data will require new and better tools. <br/><br/>First, the project will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas. It will develop software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core hardware. It will establish infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the experimental community. DIANA?s products will sit in the ROOT framework, already used by the HEP community of more than 10000 particle and nuclear physicists. By improving interoperability with the larger scientific software ecosystem, DIANA will incorporate best practices and algorithms from other disciplines into HEP. Similarly, the project will make its computing insights, tools, and novel ideas related to collaborative analysis, standards for data preservation, and best practices for treating software as a research product available to the larger scientific community. Finally, to improve the quality of the next generation of software engineers in HEP, DIANA will host an annual workshop on analysis tools and establish a fellowship program."
0.107774,"Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles and systems have become indispensable both for civil (fire-fighting, nuclear waste handling, law-enforcement, deep ocean exploration and drilling, weather forecasting, transportation) and military (guided missiles, spacecraft, unmanned drones) applications. Automation, when coupled with information technology, will continue to permeate our society at ever increasing levels. Autonomous systems, which, thus far, have been a crucial component in homeland security applications (e.g., border patrol, persistent monitoring, etc), are now seen as a key factor of empowering people in their daily lives across work, leisure, and domestic tasks. The next generation of autonomous systems will operate and interact with humans in the household or the office. The recent investment of information technology companies such as Amazon and Google in robotics technology is likely to accelerate the adoption of these new technologies by the general public. The safe and reliable operation of all these autonomous systems hinges crucially on their ability to reason and navigate about their environment. The theory and methodologies developed in this research will make it possible to run highly sophisticated algorithms inside the ""brain"" of these autonomous systems to enable optimal decision-making, thus increasing their reliability, predictability, performance and fail-safe operation. Self-driving vehicles, anthropomorphic robots, aerial drones, manufacturing automation systems, and precision surgical instruments among others, will all benefit from the results of this research.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research tackles a fundamental problem in the area of motion planning and trajectory generation for robotic and intelligent autonomous systems. A serious bottleneck in solving such problems under limited resource constraints (e.g., computer memory, time) is their high dimensionality that precludes the nave use of discretizing the (continuous) state space. In this research it is proposed to develop new incremental, optimal sampling-based motion planning algorithms with improved convergence rates over existing methods, so as to enable close-to-real-time trajectory generation for autonomous vehicles operating in an uncertain and dynamically changing environment. To achieve this objective, this research will build on recent results and ideas from Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG), along with relaxation methods borrowed from the areas of Asynchronous Dynamic Programming (ADP) and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, recent advances from machine learning can be used to address the three main issues hindering the broader applicability of probabilistic sampling based motion planners to a wider variety of problems: collision checking, efficient sampling, and local steering. One main tenet of the proposed research is the exploitation of the inherent parallelism of the proposed algorithms, which -- coupled with the recent advances in multi-core computer architectures and GPUs -- will enable real-time computations."
0.199208,"Threats are all around us: from the mundane, such as auto accidents, to the existential, such as global pandemics or nuclear war. How we perceive and manage these threats is related to a number of factors including how ""real"" the threat feels (its risk salience), our confidence in the sources of information alerting us to the threat and its potential consequences, our faith in the effectiveness of an intervention and in our ability to employ it, and our reliance upon psychological leanings that propel us to being risk-tolerant or risk-averse. The newly emerging Zika virus is a window into many of these facets, and a critically-important opportunity for those engaged in public health risk communication. This research examines how social, scientific, and policy cues influence the U.S. public's appreciation of the risk of Zika virus over time, as well as the public's receptivity to clinical, environmental, and behavioral interventions. By collecting a series of four cross-sectional population surveys over the course of a year, this research illustrates how risk salience evolves, and the extent to which it may be influenced by specific communication and information channels. Analyses reveal how social, scientific, and policy discourse contribute to public understandings of risk and further our understandings of communication strategies. Understanding how messaging changes with evolving scientific knowledge improves risk communication for future threats. These findings contribute to the literature of risk communication, which is often comprised of retrospective analyses of messages, rather than prospective studies of messaging in times of uncertainty. It also helps develop more refined and effective risk communication strategies when populations are faced with the threat of a novel pathogen. Overall, this research contributes to several disciplinary perspectives, notably those of risk assessment, hazard-related decision making, and public health risk communication.<br/><br/>The rising attention to the Zika virus offers an opportunity to examine how risk salience evolves in real-time as the threat approaches. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapies for the Zika viral infection, and there is still limited scientific understanding of the virus itself, the vectors, the disease pathogenesis, or even the epidemiology. The opportunity to measure and chart the U.S. public's perception of this threat - and how it is influenced by social, scientific, and policy cues - is time-bound, as the geographic exposure to the virus expands over time, and the data are ephemeral. This research examines how social, scientific, and policy cues influence the US public's perception of the risk over time, as well as the public's receptivity to clinical, environmental, and behavioral interventions. The specific aims of the research are to: (1) chart the trajectory of risk salience as exposure and certainty of the Zika virus increases; (2) identify and analyze the impact of social, scientific, and policy cues and discourse on risk salience; and (3) describe and analyze group differences in the evolving attitudes related to risk perception, as well as receptivity to policy, programmatic, and clinical interventions. Two data sets are developed to investigate these research aims. The first is a repeated cross-sectional national phone survey with an oversample of women of child-bearing age in the US Southern Tier (selected as a sub-population of particular vulnerability), totaling 1,200 respondents. These data are collected quarterly over a year-long period. In parallel with the primary data, a second data set quantifies the number and type of social, scientific, and policy cues observed in sentinel media sources during the time period immediately preceding the survey work. The research team merges these media data with the primary data and tests for their association with respondents? risk salience. The findings contribute to the overall literature of risk communication, which is often comprised of retrospective analyses of messages, rather than prospective studies of messaging in times of uncertainty. It is possible that messaging will change over time as the number of Zika cases increases in the US, as the number of microcephalic infant births increase, and as dramatic stories are reported with greater frequency in the press. Demonstrating how this messaging changes with evolving scientific knowledge improves risk communication for future threats."
0.425999,"The PI plans to work on a variety of problems, particularly asymptotic problems, in the general area of integrable systems. Two key tools will play a prominent role in the PI's work: Riemann-Hilbert Problems (RHP) and the non-linear, non-commutative steepest descent method, on the one hand, and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) on the other. RHPs can be viewed as the natural, non-commutative generalization of the scalar integral representations of the classical special functions, and just as the classical steepest descent method allows one to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the classical functions, so too the non-linear, non-commutative steepest descent method allows one to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of modern integrable systems such as the KdV equation and the Painleve equations, amongst many others. RMT, and in particular, the eigenvalues of random matrices, provide an extremely versatile tool to describe the behavior of a wide variety of stochastic phenomena when the underlying variables are no longer independent. Amongst the problems that the PI will address with these tools are: the asymptotic behavior of the modes of a laser as the Fresnel number goes to infinity; the behavior of random n-band matrices of size N as n,N go to infinity; universality for general orthogonal and symplectic matrix ensembles; the perturbation theory of the focusing Non-Linear Schroedinger Equation on the line.<br/><br/><br/>It is an extraordinary fact that the eigenvalues of random matrices provide a quantitative model for a wide variety of statistical phenomena from physics, pure and applied mathematics, and engineering. Applications of RMT range from the analysis of resonances in nuclear scattering theory, to the analysis of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line, in analytic number theory.Quite spectacularly, and surprisingly, even the arrival times between buses in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca, have been shown to obey random matrix theory statistics! RMT as a discipline has two components: the development of random matrix theory per se, and the application of the theory to new physical and mathematical problems. The work of the PI will impact both components. In the theory of integrable systems, two of the problems in particular proposed by the PI, arise directly from technology, viz., laser mode asymptotics, and the effect of perturbations on fiber optical transmission systems. The PI and his collaborators are also writing basic texts on RHPs and RMT aimed at the researchers as well as advanced graduate students entering the field."
0.16,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sergey Dubovskiy at the New York University. <br/><br/>Effective field theory has proven to be an extremely successful and powerful framework for describing a wide range of phenomena from particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider to the growth of density perturbations in cosmic fluids. However, it is challenged by two dramatic breakdowns of dimensional analysis---the incredible smallness of the vacuum energy and of the Higgs mass, compared to the characteristic scale of gravity. With the hope of helping to resolve these puzzles, Professor Dubovskiy aims to enrich the effective field theory toolbox with new sophisticated techniques and to come up with and test new radical theoretical ideas beyond the traditional framework. At the same time he will be looking for new observational probes, which may provide new hints on the origin of the Higgs mass and the vacuum energy. The research of Professor Dubovskiy will cover a broad spectrum of physical phenomena, ranging from the superradiant instability of astrophysical black holes as a tool to discover new particles to the dynamics of flux tubes, responsible for the confinement of quarks. <br/><br/>The research that will be funded covers not only a wide range of topics in high energy theory and cosmology, but has an impact throughout the Physics Division. For example, studies of the vacuum structure of string theory has led Prof. Dubovskiy to propose a new type of particle related to the axion, which would constitute the dark matter. Studying the interactions of this dark matter with black holes has led to extraordinary experimental signatures, ranging from astrophysical studies of black hole masses to specific gravitational wave signatures that are in the range accessible to the Advanced Large Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). These will be studied in detail. There are also substantial interrelations with atomic physics and with nuclear physics. One of the other projects will contribute to understanding the dynamics of flux tubes, which hold quarks together in the nucleon.<br/><br/>The award will also fund community outreach activities. Professor Dubovskiy will contribute to the development of the NYU Science Communication Workshop program, which helps train a generation of scientists in effective communication with the public, and the award will support numerous scientists. He also will give presentations on particle physics and cosmology at a local high school. In addition, the research project relies on the active involvement of graduate students and postdocs, thereby bringing junior physicists to the frontiers of fundamental physics research."

0.358294,"Ultrasonic testing uses high frequency sound waves to determine the state of materials without intrusion. The technique can be applied to flaw detection, small cracks due to fatigue, material characterization, and other applications. Nonlinear ultrasonic testing differs from its linear counterpart on the consideration of large amplitude of sound wave; therefore it has capabilities of detecting microstructural variations in aged steel. The measurable characteristics in nonlinear ultrasonic testing are influenced by various types and distribution of microstructural defects and cracks. This award supports fundamental research to understand the correlation between ultrasonic wave characteristics and microstructural damage. The research will develop a paradigm to detect damage in steel using ultrasonic waves by combining numerical modeling and experimental measurements. The research can be applied to structural health inspection of aging civil infrastructure such as truss bridges, pipelines, nuclear power plants, etc. Early detection of damage and subsequent repairs can extend life of structures. The results of this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves disciplines of computational mechanics, sensing and monitoring, and material science. The interdisciplinary approach will impact the education in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math disciplines.<br/><br/>Nonlinear ultrasonic testing detects microstructural variations through measuring high order harmonics; however, the nonlinear coefficient extracted from high order harmonics is influenced by the heterogeneous damage distribution and the various damage types. Although they can be assessed using experimental methods, it is practically infeasible to consider all variables in damage distribution and types when conducting nonlinear ultrasonic testing in situ. The research is to predict changes in the ultrasonic waves due to heterogeneous damage distribution in steel alloys using multi-scale numerical modeling and experiments. The micro-scale model containing material heterogeneity and microstructure will be created from micrographs to obtain nonlinear properties of damaged materials, which will then be utilized in macro scale models to assess damage. The multi-scale framework will allow modeling microstructural changes in the material and their effects on the behavior of the component. The changes in ultrasonic signal will be quantified and compared with changes in mechanical properties characterized via mechanical testing and microstructural analysis using other nondestructive evaluation techniques."
0.240048,"Organizations managing hazards must be trusted enough by citizens to gain policy support and compliance with recommendations for personal protective behavior, yet both trust and distrust are hard to change. Institutional stereotypes may contribute to this resistance to change. This project will use focus groups and a survey to identify stereotypical attributes of three institutional types at both general (government, business, nonprofits) and specific (government agency, corporation, advocacy groups) levels, including both common stereotypes (e.g., government red tape; business profit-chasing; nonprofit sentimentality) and rarer potential attributes (e.g., whether the institution values respect for authority, or purity and sanctity, in addition to reducing harm). These responses will be compared to attributes of specific national organizations (e.g., Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) in these three categories in varied hazard domains (e.g., food safety, nuclear power). This will allow for seeing whether organizations rated as being ?typical? of their category have the same perceived attributes as when they are rated as more abstract entities (such as ""government"" or ""corporation""). A subsequent experiment will assess how much stereotypes affect trust, confidence, and cooperation when a specific organization (e.g., FDA) is managing a hazard, and a citizen has situation-specific information-not just stereotypes-to help determine whether the organization is trustworthy. Experiments will then test alternative messages based on either stereotype manipulation or other factors affecting trust (e.g., feeling that you share salient values with the organization; feelings that the hazardous activity or process is ""good"" or ""bad"")to see if the messages affect cooperation in real cases (e.g., donations to specific advocacy groups; purchases of radon test kits in a specific state). <br/><br/>Stereotypes of institutions may be at least partly responsible for perseverance of (dis)trust, yet this potential causal link has not been tested; we do not even know whether these stereotypes are relatively simple or complex, or whether they vary across people, institutional categories, or topical domains (e.g., food safety versus radon). The practical implications of this research should be to help government, business, and nonprofit managers understand how much influence their actions will have on citizens' and consumers' views of how they will or do manage hazards. If stereotypes beyond the control of managers dominate trust judgments and cooperation, then managers can abandon attempts to build trust and focus on convincing people that it is in their own best interest to perform a specific behavior (e.g., test for radon) regardless of whether they trust the institution. If the experiments show instead that situation-specific information about the organization swamps any effects of its institutional stereotype, then managers will know to emphasize their specific situation in order to improve how the organization is perceived or how much cooperation (e.g., adoption of recommendations for self-preservation, purchases, or donations) it gets from the public. Mapping of how organizations are positioned relative to others in their institutional category (e.g., one corporation versus another), or to extra-category organizations in their topic domain (i.e., potential allies or enemies), could be used by organizations to evaluate where they might need to strengthen their reputations. Given the value of distrust in a democracy depends upon citizens being well-informed about institutions, this map if posted in publicly accessible forums (online or offline) could help citizens evaluate organizations with which they must deal, raising personal efficacy and (potentially) institutional responsiveness to citizen demands."
0.333355,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>The objective of this work is to understand the fundamental mechanisms through which mobile twin boundaries (TBs) actively engage and rapidly remove stacking fault tetrahedra (SFTs). The ultimate goal is to design advanced metallic materials that can effectively remove SFTs at low-to-intermediate temperatures. SFTs are detrimental defects in neutron or proton irradiated structural metallic materials with face-centered-cubic structures as they can induce significant hardening and swelling. The PI will use a combination of in situ radiation and in situ nanoindentation technique to investigate the interaction of SFTs with TBs. These studies can explain the annihilation of SFTs by TBs and provide crucial information to validate annihilation mechanisms predicted by MD simulations. Also significant mobility of TBs may make them attractive candidates to remove radiation induced immobile defects, such as SFTs. <br/><br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>If successful, the benefits of this research will include discovery of important criteria for the design of swelling resistant structural materials for next generation nuclear reactors, and offer the basis for further exploration of physics of radiation induced twin boundary migrations. This project will provide research training to graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University (TAMU). Special effort will be made to recruit female and other minority students through the ""Pathway to Ph.D program"" funded by TAMU. The project will also enhance the materials science and nanoengineering curricula by incorporating relevant results into classes when introducing advanced nanomaterials, and benefit the new formed Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The PI will disseminate results to a much broader audience by involving high school teachers in the research project through NSF-RET program, and attending international conferences. Collaborations with McMaster University and several DOE National Laboratories will offer graduate students summer research experience."
0.655,"With this CAREER award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Arthur Bragg of Johns Hopkins University to conduct experimental investigations on how the course of light-driven nonadiabatic bond formation is controlled by reactant structure and chemical environment. Nonadiabatic processes are fundamental relaxation pathways of energetically excited molecules and give rise to fast and efficient photochemical processes. Aims include improved understanding of energy conversion mechanisms, for example, in photochemistry and photobiology, and determination of conditions under which light-driven chemical processes can be controlled. Multiple state-of-the-art research methods are employed, providing high level training opportunities for student researchers. These students are also involved in development of webcam-based spectrometers and associated secondary-level chemistry curricula, enabling exploration of basic concepts in chemistry, spectroscopy, and instrument design. Educational objectives are met through development of curricular units and professional development workshops for training educators, with administrative program assistance provided by the Center for Educational Outreach (CEO) at JHU. Curriculum development targets integration of basic quantitative spectroscopic experimentation into classroom projects that meet new targets outlined in the Next Generation Science Standards. The spectrometers and curricular materials will be provided to teachers and students in the Baltimore City Schools. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to determine how the nature of nuclear dynamics associated with nonadiabatic electrocyclic bond formation and its overall efficacy are affected fundamentally by reactant structure and chemical environment. The work focuses specifically on the photochemical dynamics of ortho-arenes and related systems, as these are tractable systems for detailed experimental interrogation. Time-resolved absorption and Raman spectroscopies are used to probe dynamics of excited molecules on timescales down to tens of femtoseconds, as these are the timescales on which bonds form and break. These measurements and supportive quantum chemical computations target characterization of molecular dynamics that occur on the approach to and crossing through intersections between electronic states upon excitation, giving rise to bond formation or other energy deactivation pathways. The photoinduced dynamics of these systems is also studied to probe solvent-solute interactions that impact the course of solution-phase chemistry. Findings are expected to provide experimental benchmarks on the structure and solvent dependence of these processes, supporting prediction of relaxation and energy transfer pathways of large molecules both empirically and computationally."
0.436051,"Intellectual Merit. Proteins are complex molecules that are the workhorses of biological organisms: they catalyze reactions, carry nutrients, provide structural support and transmit signals, just to name a few examples. The molecular structure of a protein is composed of a long string (polymer) of linked amino acids, with a variety of side chains that extend out from the backbone (similar to a charm bracelet). This string is then folded into a specifically-defined 3-dimensional structure that constitutes its functional form.<br/> Many critical signal transmission pathways are initiated by the activities of Galpha protein subunits, which are in turn controlled by regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS proteins). In particular, interactions between RGS proteins and their specific G proteins turn on and off pathways that influence brain development and function. Although much has been learned about the mechanisms of signal transmission, more research is required to obtain a thorough, molecular-level grasp of brain function. This research project focuses on two of the >20 proteins in the RGS protein family: RGS4 and RGS7. Both proteins can control the signaling of Gialpha1 (a common type of Galpha protein subunit), but the interaction between RGS4 and Gialpha1 is ~60 times stronger than that between RGS7 and Gialpha1. Normally, these differences are explained by variations in the types of amino acids that are found in the interface between the two proteins: one pair of interacting proteins may have more compatible and therefore stronger contacts than the other pair. However, when looking at the interfaces of RGS4 and RGS7 with Gialpha1, there is only one small difference between them and it cannot account for the large difference in binding preference.<br/>Other researchers have found evidence for changes in the three-dimensional structures of the protein backbones and/or the flexibility of the molecules in both RGS and Gialpha1 proteins when they interact. In addition, scientists have recently become more aware that these kinds of motions can have powerful influences over the functional capabilities of signaling proteins. This research therefore tests the hypothesis that internal movements within RGS proteins play critical roles in both their abilities to interact with various types of Galpha protein subunits and also their different degrees of preference. In order to investigate this we are using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, which is a very powerful instrument that permits the detailed analysis of proteins; in fact, we can watch the activities of individual atoms within these molecules and thereby gain in-depth insight into their activities. The results from this work will fundamentally improve our awareness of the role of protein motions in molecular recognition and help explain the selectivity of RGS proteins for particular Galpha protein subunits, and accelerate advancements in our overall understanding of signaling mechanisms and control at the molecular level.<br/>Broader impacts. California State University, Northridge (CSUN) is a primarily undergraduate institution. Over half of the science students are from underrepresented minority groups; many students are the first in their family to attend college and are economically disadvantaged. There are few minority scientists doing protein biophysical research; this project should help to expand those numbers by drawing from the large pool of underrepresented students in the department. This project will also provide unprecedented opportunities to CSUN students to participate in cutting-edge research using modern methods and technology. For many students this will be the first (and possibly only) chance they will have to experience real research challenges and to learn troubleshooting and problem-solving skills. These new research skills will translate into increased self-confidence, improved learning in courses, and an increased likelihood that they will be inspired to pursue advanced degrees in Biochemistry or Structural Biology. Speaking more generally, a third major outcome of the project will be to illustrate to the broader public that high-quality, impactful research can be performed at a primarily undergraduate institution."

The same foundation will enable prosthetic limbs and exoskeletons that match the natural dynamics of a human leg, while running all day on a single battery charge. <br/><br/>This research will enhance understanding of the interaction between the design of a legged system and its dynamics during touchdown, stance, and swing, focusing on three key aspects of the design: First, the inertia distribution in the leg, with an emphasis on how mass placement, number of links, and ""redundant"" elements of leg kinematics (such as pointing the knee ""up"" or ""down"") contribute to the impact felt by the system at touchdown and the dynamics during swing phase. Second, the motor coupling to the linkages, focusing on how different mappings between actuation and mechanism degrees of freedom can lead to the motors either sharing loads or fighting against each other. Third, spring function and placement, including desirable nonlinearities for mitigation of impacts and swing-phase ringing, alignment of principle stiffness axes with mechanism degrees of freedom, and transmissions that allow for configuration-dependent elasticity. The research approach draws on examples from biology and previously constructed robots, utilizes mathematical tools from applied mechanics, and builds on prior work with experimental walking and running robots."
0.34029,"The research objective of this award is to investigate the effect of porosity and to develop constitutive models accounting for this effect in two different types of kinematically constrained material systems. Examples of the first type include low-symmetry metals, such as magnesium and zirconium alloys, which are nominally incompressible polycrystalline aggregates, but which can undergo significant volumetric strains when porosity is present. Examples of the second type include magnetic shape-memory alloys, such as nickel-manganese-gallium systems, which have been found to exhibit ""giant"" field-induced strains in costly single crystals, but only minimal magnetostriction in cheaper polycrystals. In this case, the presence of porosity can help relax the internal kinematic constraints in the polycrystal due to the strong orientational character of the magnetostriction in the grains that tend to block each other?s strains. The main challenge is to properly account for the dilatational and relaxational effects of the porosity in constitutive models for the response of these materials under general loading conditions. This will be accomplished by means of a recently developed ""iterated"" nonlinear homogenization technique, which makes use of suitably chosen ""linear comparison"" media to generate highly accurate and efficient estimates for the coupled, nonlinear response of porous single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of these materials.<br/><br/>If successful, the benefits of this research will include improved understanding and advanced modeling of the mechanical properties of high-performance metal alloys for energy-efficient applications in the automotive, aerospace and nuclear industries, as well as of the magneto-elastic response of magnetic shape-memory alloys for applications such as actuators, sensors and energy-harvesting devices. The research is also expected to lead to improved characterization of net-shape metal-forming operations, as well as of ductile failure in polycrystalline materials via void growth and coalescence. In addition, the results will be of interest for modeling of geomaterials, such as ice, halite and olivine. The work may also be relevant for the development of other active material systems, such as certain types of polycrystalline ferroelectrics."
0.14,"In this project funded by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Vladimir Mandelshtam of the University of California, Irvine, is conducting research in the area of theoretical chemistry. He is developing new computational methods that take advantage of advances in high performance computers. These methods are being applied in the study of important and interesting properties of clusters of molecules at the atomic level. Another major component of Professor Mandelshtam's research is the development and application of computational methods designed to process data from Magnetic Resonance experiments. These new methods are providing ways to process the signals, reducing the time required for experiments and making new experiments possible. These methods could also be applied to other experimental studies. The development of new numerical techniques and distribution of software allows a broader research community to conduct their studies. The software resulting from this project is being made available free of charge to the scientific community. <br/><br/>Professor Mandelshtam's research in Quantum Statistical Mechanics is concerned with the development of the Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP) method. SCP was introduced several decades ago in solid-state physics. While potentially very powerful, until recently SCP was essentially limited to systems with simple pairwise interactions. The breakthrough algorithmic improvements introduced in Professor Mandelshtam's group made it possible to reduce the computational times by several orders of magnitude, thus, making SCP practical for general systems. Further algorithmic improvements are being pursued that should make SCP even more efficient, such as an algorithm that would replace an iterative self-consistent solution of coupled non-linear equations by a deterministic minimization procedure. SCP is being applied to compute the spectra and other equilibrium properties of water and ion-water clusters. Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is also being used to complement these studies and to help assess the accuracy of SCP. The major focus associated with the development of the Filter Diagonalization Method (FDM) is its implementation for 3D Diffusion Ordered SpectroscopY (DOSY), which is a unique and potentially very powerful Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiment designed to characterize mixtures in solutions. DOSY is currently limited in its applications due to the lack of an adequate inversion algorithm associated with the solution of the inverse Laplace transform problem. The advantage of FDM is due to its multidimensional nature that allows one to avoid the unfavorable factorization of the 3-dimensional inversion problem to 1-dimensional problems."
0.008598,"Over the past several thousand years, human expansion into tropical forests and the associated transformation of landscapes into patchworks of forested, agricultural, and urban habitats has had a negative impact on primate populations and led to increases in direct conflict between humans and wild, nonhuman primates. However, despite this long history of contact, the influence of human (anthropogenic) factors on primate evolutionary trajectories is not fully understood. This project will examine how anthropogenically-fragmented landscapes affect gene flow, genetic structure, and functional connectivity among wild populations of the silvery-brown tamarin, a charismatic and endangered primate from the Rio Magdalena valley in northern Colombia. The study will strengthen long-term international collaborations between US and Colombian researchers and help bolster relationships between researchers, the local community, and the state environmental corporation, which will further support the conservation of this endangered primate. It will also provide research, training, and mentorship opportunities for a female graduate student and undergraduates, thereby promoting and engaging greater participation of underrepresented constituencies in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Tamarins are small-bodied monkeys with relatively short generation times, and across their geographic range they are subject to ongoing anthropogenic landscape changes. At the same time, they show a high degree of mobility and ability to survive in human-modified habitats, resulting in their sharing space with humans and making tamarins ideal models for understanding the evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation. Using next-generation genomic techniques, this project will type tens of thousands of markers from across the nuclear genome for dozens of individual tamarins to determine how natural and anthropogenic factors together shape patterns of genetic variation at the landscape level. This will be one of the first genomic studies of population structure in wild primates and one of the first to explicitly examine the effects of human-induced habitat change. The genetic data and results will be disseminated through scientific journals and presentations and will be given to environmental agencies for future implementation of conservation actions."
0.284953,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Tin whiskers are long filaments that grow spontaneously out of coatings and solders used in electronics manufacturing. They are a critical reliability problem because they create short circuits that have led to satellite crashes, a nuclear power plant shutdown and a medical pacemaker recall, among many other failures. The risk from whiskers has become worse because the element lead (Pb) has been restricted from manufacturing for environmental reasons. In the past, addition of this element helped to suppress whisker formation. The research is focused on understanding the causes of whisker formation as well as developing and testing methods for suppressing them. The work uses a unique system that enables the surface of the coating to be monitored for whisker formation at the same time as the stress in the coating is measured. Since stress is believed to be the reason for whisker formation, this allows the connection between stress and whiskering to be directly measured. In addition to fundamental studies, there are collaborations with industrial partners to study issues related to whisker prevention. In science and technology education, a major problem has been the retention of first generation and underserved students in these fields. The principal investigator is improving this through team-based mentoring efforts to support new students and exposing them to laboratory research early in their academic careers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Although stress is believed to be the driving force for whisker formation, it is not understood why whiskers form from specific sites (nucleation) and what controls their volume evolution (growth). This research builds on the development of a unique system to simultaneously measure the whisker density and the stress (induced by thermal expansion when the sample is heated). Measurements show how the stress changes the nucleation rate and how much it decreases the barrier to nucleation. These studies further suggest a potential nucleation mechanism that is based on stress-induced grain boundary migration. In situ transmission and scanning electron microscope studies that monitor the grain structure under stress can capture the nucleation process to explore this mechanism further. Electron microscopy measurements of the whisker volume evolution show that the growth rate is proportional to the average stress, as long as it is above a critical threshold value. Calculations are being developed that use finite element methods to model the balance between stress relaxation due to rate-dependent plasticity and stress-driven diffusion. These model predictions can be compared directly with the growth measurements to refine the model parameters and allow prediction of whisker growth rates. In collaboration with industrial researchers, the experimental capabilities are being extended to measure the effect of corrosion/humidity on whisker nucleation and growth. A new technique for using mechanical pressure to induce whiskers is being developed to study new solder formulations to determine their ability to suppress whiskering."

0.48,"Technical Description: The research aim of this CAREER project is to understand the photo-physics and spin-physics of single point defects in ZnO as a platform for quantum information science and quantum-enhanced metrology. While quantum information science promises fundamentally new technological capabilities, implementation of these theoretical ideas in a physical system is very challenging. Single point defects in semiconductor crystals are promising quantum systems with potential for scalability through integration with conventional computing technology and other quantum systems. This research project studies point defects in ZnO using a ""single-molecule"" approach, combining confocal fluorescence microscopy, time-resolved single-photon counting, and magnetic resonance to understand the structure and dynamics of this individually addressable quantum system. Emphasis is on understanding spin and photo dynamics with an eye toward controlling the quantum states of electronic and nuclear spins, and on the generation of high-quality single photon sources. In addition, ZnO growth is studied, both in the principle investigator's laboratory and through collaboration, to understand and control the formation of defects and how they interact with the electronic and photonic properties of ZnO.<br/><br/>Non-technical Description: This project examines the optical and magnetic behavior of single atom-scale defects. An example is a single missing atom within the array of atoms that form a crystal. Such defects can behave like single atoms, even at room temperature, within a solid-state environment. Understanding and controlling these point defects could lead to new technology for computing and communication because their behavior is governed by quantum mechanics. The research team studies a single defect through its optical signature by detecting the individual photons it emits under different experimental conditions and in samples grown using different methods. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project benefit from research experience in a stimulating and interdisciplinary environment. The principal investigator (PI) also develops hands-on science lessons, including equipment and supplies that may be borrowed by teachers through the Cornell Center for Materials Research lending library. The PI works with teachers on the development of these kits, and brings teachers into the laboratory so they can experience scientific research and share it with their students."
0.348336,"With their combination of heat resistance, wear and corrosion resistance, and high compressive strength, structural ceramics are ideal candidates for many critical aeronautic, automobile, refractory, and nuclear applications. However, the fracture toughness of ceramics is very low compared to metals, which reduces the mechanical reliability. The inability to toughen ceramics has limited their use in critical engineering applications. This award supports research which aims to address this critical gap in knowledge by applying to ceramics a laser processing technique originally devised for metals, to improve the low fracture toughness and crack sensitivity. This research has the potential to lead to the widespread use structural ceramics in a variety of applications such as cutting tools, turbine engines, and armor. The research team will promote engineering education through outreach programs such as ""Sunday with a Scientist"" presentations at the University of Nebraska State Museum, and the partnership with the McNair Scholars Program to train undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to improve the low fracture toughness and crack sensitivity of structural ceramics by inhibiting surface-originated crack propagation using a thermally engineered laser shock peening process. To fulfill the research goal, four objectives will be completed to (1) develop the process for performing thermally engineered laser shock peening on ceramics; (2) assess the residual stresses and mechanical properties of ceramics following laser shock peening; (3) reveal the microstructure-property relationship of ceramics in the laser shock peening process; and (4) identify the mechanisms by which laser shock peening toughens ceramics. The team will apply this process to a variety of structural ceramics and measure their residual stresses and fracture toughness. The microstructural evolution of the ceramics will then be characterized using transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam techniques. The toughening mechanisms will be identified through modeling and ex-situ and in-situ electron microscopy methods. This work will provide new fundamental knowledge of the processing-microstructure-property relationships in ceramics with respect to the laser shock peening process. In addition, the results will advance the field by shedding light on the mechanism of toughening ceramics by controlling the residual stress state and microstructural changes."

0.20982,"Title: Collaborative Research: Understanding Ion Solvation Effects in Nonaqueous Oxygen Electroreduction Reactions<br/>Bryan D. McCloskey/ Venkatasubraman Viswanathan<br/>Proposal Number: 1604927/1604898<br/><br/>Of all battery chemistries currently being explored to power next-generation electric vehicles, metal-air (O2) couples possess some of the highest known theoretical specific energies and volumetric energy densities. In particular, the aprotic nonaqueous Li-O2 battery has recently received significant attention because of its superior specific energy. Yet many of the challenges facing Li-O2 battery development remain unsolved. One of these challenges involves understanding the link between electrolyte composition and the discharge/charge electrochemical processes. The proposed research will address the fundamental dependence of the Li-O2 electrochemistry mechanism on both cation and anion solvation, thereby providing a better understanding of how to improve the performance of high-energy nonaqueous Li-O2 and other metal-O2 batteries. If successful, Li-O2 batteries could advance and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles for reduced emissions, improved efficiency, and domestic energy security. The PIs are committed to broad dissemination of their results. As such, they will develop online video modules to make publicly accessible the prospects of this exciting new area of energy storage. The online modules will be structured for simple incorporation into energy and electrochemical system courses, including those taught by the PIs. The PIs will also develop a broader and more engaging educational content on electrochemistry/batteries with a vision to run a massive online open course. <br/><br/>The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the effect of ion solvation on the fundamental oxygen electrochemistry in nonaqueous electrolytes, with a particular emphasis on oxygen reduction in Li+-bearing electrolytes. Recent studies have identified the importance of electrolyte composition on both the ultimate oxygen reduction product formed and the mechanism by which it forms. For example, a 2 e- oxygen reduction to form lithium peroxide, Li2O2, is found to occur in nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries, whereas a 1 e- reduction process to form sodium superoxide, NaO2, occurs in Na-O2 batteries. Furthermore, the Li-O2 discharge mechanism was recently shown to be affected by a delicate interplay between anion and solvent selection, as the Lewis acidity and basicity of both components affected the lifetime of oxygen reduction intermediates in solution. The PIs used this knowledge to improve the discharge capacity (or usable energy) of a Li-O2 battery four-fold. However, the understanding of the complex role of electrolyte constituents (ions, additives, and solvents) on electrode reactions and ion solvation is not complete. This understanding potentially has far-reaching implications in many other electrochemical systems (e.g., CO2 reduction, Li-S batteries, and other metal-air batteries). The proposed research tasks will leverage unique experimental and theoretical capabilities developed by the PIs to study Li-O2 batteries, including Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) to quantify Coulombic efficiency of batteries employing different electrolyte compositions, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe cation and anion solvation in these electrolytes. The theoretical capabilities to describe non-equilibrium charge transport, and solution and surface electrochemistry, will be based on density functional theory calculations. Through a well-developed theoretical and experimental framework, the PIs will identify novel electrolyte compositions that can trigger solution electrochemistry, thereby improving discharge capacity while maintaining chemical stability. The PIs will then experimentally link ion solvation effects in the most promising electrolyte compositions to stability and capacity enhancements."

0.14,"Most every-day life processes are governed by classical mechanics. Newton's second law of motion is a well-known example of this. In certain situations, quantum mechanical laws come into play and the classical laws no longer provide an accurate description of the system dynamics. The quantum mechanical laws are well established. However, applying these laws and making quantitative predictions is a highly challenging task of fundamental and technical importance. The periodic table and nuclear chart, for example, are the result of quantum mechanical considerations, as are the working principles of solar cells. The activities supported by the grant will greatly advance our understanding of quantum mechanical few-body systems. These systems serve as prototypes for more complex systems. Where possible, the planned theoretical studies will be benchmarked against experimental results. As part of this program, multiple graduate and undergraduate students will be trained. These students will have access to state-of-the-art computing resources and will develop strong numerical and analytical skills; thus, they will be well prepared for a variety of future pursuits in academia, at national labs or in industry.<br/><br/><br/>Near zero temperature, few-body correlations are often times governed by just a few parameters such as the two-body s-wave scattering length and the two-body effective range. This suggests that effective low-energy few-atom Hamiltonians can be utilized to describe the key aspects of cold few-body collisions and of weakly-bound few-body states. The idea of replacing the true interactions by effective interactions is similar to what Fermi did in his groundbreaking 1934 paper on the scattering between slow neutrons and bound hydrogen atoms. The present grant capitalizes on experimental and theoretical advances in cold atom physics and provides support for theoretical studies of cold few-atom systems. Techniques will be developed and applied to solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation for different classes of non-trivial few-body systems, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of few-particle correlations and universal low-energy features. The analytical approaches include perturbative treatments around the strongly-coupled regime and the use of a hyperspherical coordinate approach that can be viewed as a trap analog of the Bethe ansatz. Numerical techniques include a Lippmann-Schwinger equation based treatment and a basis set expansion technique that utilizes explicitly correlated Gaussians."
2.372188,"Recent years have seen enormous progress in the physics of neutrino mixing, but several critical questions remain: What is the value of 13, the last unmeasured mixing angle in the neutrino mixing matrix? What is the mass hierarchy? Do neutrino oscillations violate CP symmetry? Why are the quark and neutrino mixing matrices so different? The value of 13 is central to each of these questions. Its value sets the scale for experiments needed to resolve the mass hierarchy and to search for CP violation. In addition, the size of 13 with respect to the other mixing angles may give insights into the origin of these angles and source of neutrino mass. Reactor experiments hold the promise of unambiguously determining the 13 mixing angle.<br/><br/>This proposal, from the University of Chicago, Columbia University and Barnard College, requests funds to construct the outer muon veto and tagging system for the Double Chooz neutrino oscillation experiment. The goal of the experiment is the measurement of 13 with almost an order-of-magnitude better sensitivity than the current best limit. The veto system is the main detector element used to suppress backgrounds and to understand their systematic uncertainties, which will be essential to reaching the experiment's sensitivity goal. <br/><br/>The Double Chooz Experiment will use two detectors near the Chooz Nuclear Power Station in France. As a result of the few MeV energy of the reactor antineutrinos, cosmogenic backgrounds are a serious issue for reactor experiments. The Double Chooz Experiment uses a two-part, inner-outer veto system to reduce and measure these backgrounds. This group proposes to construct the outer veto, a large-area system of scintillating counters placed above the detector. In addition to providing significant background suppression, the outer veto is expected to be a powerful tool in studying individual backgrounds, particularly the 9Li background which is the dominant background systematic uncertainty.<br/><br/>As for the Broader Impacts of this project, if the Double Chooz experiment demonstrates that 13 is nonzero, searches for CP violation will be particularly compelling. CP violation in the neutrino sector may ultimately help explain the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the universe through leptogenesis. Observation of any CP violation in the neutrino sector would be an important clue to one of the most fundamental questions in particle physics."

0.273715,"Stars within the Milky Way and other galaxies are formed as giant clouds of gas composed primarily of hydrogen and helium collapse under their own gravity, thus heating up the gas to the point where nuclear fusion is triggered and stars are formed. The life cycles of these interstellar clouds drives the internal evolution of all galaxies. The goal of this project is to study the earliest stages of the formation of these clouds by observing the spectra from certain atomic and molecular species, which serve as tracers of these otherwise cold, dark clouds. The project will carry out these observations by using the NSF supported High Elevation Antarctic Terahertz (HEAT) telescope. Outside of space, the Antarctic plateau on which the HEAT telescope is located is one of the few places on Earth that these observations can be made. The project will use the HEAT telescope to map these giant clouds along the plane of our galaxy with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.<br/><br/>Current theories of molecular cloud formation are guided and constrained by atomic (HI) and molecular (CO) observations of the cloud gas in the interstellar medium. However, HI and CO surveys are less sensitive to the early stages of the molecular cloud formation. Through measurements of CI and CII line emissivity with HEAT, the project will map the early stages of cloud formation as clouds of atomic hydrogen transition to Giant Molecular Clouds of H2. The project also plans to observe the NII line to determine the ionizing luminosity of OB stars, which is a standard metric for star formation rate. This data will be correlated with the rate of destruction of nearby GMCs as measured by the CII observations.<br/><br/>The HEAT telescope is a fully automated facility designed to run unattended for a year between servicing missions. The proposal points out that there are actually two fully functional HEAT telescope/receiver facilities; one that is deployed in Antarctica while the other is being refurbished in Arizona for the following year. This project will build upon previous efforts by the PI to train of a new generation of scientists and engineers by involving them not only in the science from the facility, but by providing a hands-on experience with the instrumentation as the off-duty HEAT telescope is refurbished. The project intends to communicate its results to the general public in two ways. First, the project will use the off-duty facility for public outreach demonstrations held at the University of Arizona. Second, the project intends to present the HEAT project via a program produced for PBS?s NOVA television series."
0.603847,"Nitrate pollution due to human activities (such as extensive use of fertilizers) is a global concern in freshwater and marine environments. Some negative impacts of nitrate pollution are well known--for example, extensive algal blooms or formation of the oxygen-deprived ""dead zones"" in nutrient-polluted waters. However, some of the dangers posed by excess nitrates may be more subtle and occur at much lower nitrate concentrations. The present study will investigate such novel mechanism of the impacts of low-level nitrate pollution on freshwater ecosystems which may be caused by conversion of nitrate into a potent signaling molecule--nitric oxide--which affects key cellular and physiological functions in a variety of organisms including humans. The PI will use a common freshwater organism--a water flea--to determine how nitric oxide derived from the nitrate found in the environment affects development, growth and reproduction. This study will provide novel insights into the effects of nitrate pollution on freshwater ecosystems and can have implications for understanding of the effects of excessive use of fertilizers on the health of freshwater ecosystems and the organisms that depend on them (including humans). <br/><br/>Human activities have significantly modified the Earth's nitrogen cycle. The amount of nitrogen that is biologically available in ecosystems has dramatically increased through commercial nitrogen fixation for the production of fertilizers. The benefits associated with increased food production resulting from the use of synthetic fertilizers have been tempered by nitrogen pollution resulting in regional loss of water quality and biodiversity. Recent studies have revealed that levels of nitrates in the environment, previously considered to be safe, can be converted to the potent signaling molecule, nitric oxide, which may interfere with processes such as development, growth, and reproduction. Using state-of-the-art technologies in molecular biology, the mechanism by which nitric oxide, derived from environmental nitrate, interferes with embryo development will be established. The study will be conducted using a model crustacean species, Daphnia pulex; however, the mechanistic information obtained will be useful for the assessment of hazards associated with low-level nitrate exposure on other species, including humans. The first aim of this research will be to determine the molecular mechanism by which environmentally derived nitric oxide interferes with hormone signaling pathways, and is specifically focused on the interactions of nitric oxide with two nuclear receptors. The second aim will be to extend the molecular studies to whole organism evaluations of the consequences of nitric oxide exposure on specific aspects of embryo development. The final aim will be to quantify the population-level consequences of environmentally derived nitric oxide as shown in the previous aims to interfere with specific aspects of embryo development. Results from this research will provide a mechanistic understanding of how environmentally relevant levels of nitrate could result in declines in some wildlife populations through the dysregulation of molecular signaling processes critical to population sustainability. This study also will support an ambitious research-based outreach activity aimed at identifying variables that impact nitrate levels in the natural environmental. This outreach effort will provide mentoring training to graduate students and hands-on field and laboratory research experience for undergraduate students."
0.202352,"Title: Collaborative Research: Understanding Ion Solvation Effects in Nonaqueous Oxygen Electroreduction Reactions<br/>Bryan D. McCloskey/ Venkatasubraman Viswanathan<br/>Proposal Number: 1604927/1604898<br/><br/>Of all battery chemistries currently being explored to power next-generation electric vehicles, metal-air (O2) couples possess some of the highest known theoretical specific energies and volumetric energy densities. In particular, the aprotic nonaqueous Li-O2 battery has recently received significant attention because of its superior specific energy. Yet many of the challenges facing Li-O2 battery development remain unsolved. One of these challenges involves understanding the link between electrolyte composition and the discharge/charge electrochemical processes. The proposed research will address the fundamental dependence of the Li-O2 electrochemistry mechanism on both cation and anion solvation, thereby providing a better understanding of how to improve the performance of high-energy nonaqueous Li-O2 and other metal-O2 batteries. If successful, Li-O2 batteries could advance and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles for reduced emissions, improved efficiency, and domestic energy security. The PIs are committed to broad dissemination of their results. As such, they will develop online video modules to make publicly accessible the prospects of this exciting new area of energy storage. The online modules will be structured for simple incorporation into energy and electrochemical system courses, including those taught by the PIs. The PIs will also develop a broader and more engaging educational content on electrochemistry/batteries with a vision to run a massive online open course. <br/><br/>The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the effect of ion solvation on the fundamental oxygen electrochemistry in nonaqueous electrolytes, with a particular emphasis on oxygen reduction in Li+-bearing electrolytes. Recent studies have identified the importance of electrolyte composition on both the ultimate oxygen reduction product formed and the mechanism by which it forms. For example, a 2 e- oxygen reduction to form lithium peroxide, Li2O2, is found to occur in nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries, whereas a 1 e- reduction process to form sodium superoxide, NaO2, occurs in Na-O2 batteries. Furthermore, the Li-O2 discharge mechanism was recently shown to be affected by a delicate interplay between anion and solvent selection, as the Lewis acidity and basicity of both components affected the lifetime of oxygen reduction intermediates in solution. The PIs used this knowledge to improve the discharge capacity (or usable energy) of a Li-O2 battery four-fold. However, the understanding of the complex role of electrolyte constituents (ions, additives, and solvents) on electrode reactions and ion solvation is not complete. This understanding potentially has far-reaching implications in many other electrochemical systems (e.g., CO2 reduction, Li-S batteries, and other metal-air batteries). The proposed research tasks will leverage unique experimental and theoretical capabilities developed by the PIs to study Li-O2 batteries, including Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) to quantify Coulombic efficiency of batteries employing different electrolyte compositions, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe cation and anion solvation in these electrolytes. The theoretical capabilities to describe non-equilibrium charge transport, and solution and surface electrochemistry, will be based on density functional theory calculations. Through a well-developed theoretical and experimental framework, the PIs will identify novel electrolyte compositions that can trigger solution electrochemistry, thereby improving discharge capacity while maintaining chemical stability. The PIs will then experimentally link ion solvation effects in the most promising electrolyte compositions to stability and capacity enhancements."
34.691037,"The vision of the ERC is to create new fluid power technology that is compact and efficient. This will cause a radical transformation of fluid power, signigicantly reducing energy consumption and soawning whole new industries. New control approaches and system configurations will be developed to replace current, inefficient valve throttling approaches. These include high performance pump control, regeneration, on-off valve PWM control and biomimetic distributed pumping and control. A new generation of pump motors and actuators with improved efficiency, enabled by actively controlled tribological surfaces, will be developed. Biologically inspired coatings will reduce drag. Phase-change energy storage will create more compact energy storage and soures. Chemofluidie actuation and free-piston engine compressors will provide order-of-magnitude better energy and power density for self-powered and mobile devices, enabling a host of new applications. Use of composite and functionally graded materials and integrating components into unfied systems will minimize the weight and volume of fluid power systems. Problems with noise, vibration, leakage, contamination and awkward interfaces will be addressed, leading to wider, more efficient and more satisfactory use of fluid power. The result will be an expansion of fluid power use, currently limited to heavy equipment, to portable and self-powered devices such as high-power wearable tools and rescue robots. Whole new industries will be created where compact and efficient fluid power can be used for underwater exploration, for rescue operations, for remotely manipulating nuclear materials, for bomb disposal, for medical and rehabilitation applications and for wearable or compact tools for home and industrial use. Improved compactness will enable fluid power to perform tasks that are not presently possible. Improved efficiently will significantly reduce petroleum consumption and pollution. For each one percent improvement in overall fuel comsumption for transportation, $2.4 billion of crude oil is saved each year. The superior power density of fluid power makes it ideal for regenerative braking with field tests showing fuel savings of 25 to 35% for trucks. The ERC will develop new, high density accumulators making the regeneration approach feasible for passenger vehicles, resulting in much larger energy savings. Significant energy savings can also be achieved in the construction, mining, agricultural and industrial sectors. Education and outreach innovations of the ERC include (1) the development of benchmark fluid power labs augmented with take-home laboratory ,odules (2) collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota to develop permanent and traveling exhibits, educational materials on fluid power and an extracurricular fluid power program for middle schools and high schools, (3) collaboration with Project Lead the Way to include fluid power in a high school technology curriculum, (4) the creation of industrial internship and co-op programs for both undergraduate and graduate students, and (5) the enhancement of continuing education in fluid power for industry through hands-on short courses and distance education."
0.537541,"This project explores the nearly perfect fluid-flow properties of a special class of ultra-cold atoms, Fermi gases, which are tightly confined in a bowl made of laser light and cooled to temperatures just billionths of a degree above absolute zero. The bowl is turned off to release the ultra-cold atoms into a high vacuum and they are imaged during expansion by laser flash-photography. By just turning a knob in these tabletop experiments, an expanding atom cloud can be made to simulate the behavior of electrons in superconductors, neutrons in neutron stars, or even an exotic state of matter that existed just microseconds after the Big Bang. The study of these nearly perfect fluids has practical significance in testing theories of high temperature superconductors, which will one day enable energy-saving power transmission, and fundamental significance in testing theories of perfect fluid flow that may have occurred just after the Big Bang. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to measure precisely the nearly perfect hydrodynamic transport properties of an ultra-cold atomic Fermi gas. Spin-up and spin-down atoms are made to strongly interact by means of a bias magnetic field, tuned near a collisional (Feshbach) resonance. A collision between two such clouds produces shock waves as the strongly-interacting clouds bounce off each other. Measurements of the shear viscosity above, at, and below resonance will enable new tests of the lower bound predicted for a perfect fluid using string theory methods. Studies of scale-invariant flow at resonance will determine the bulk viscosity and test general predictions for scale invariant systems. The experiments cross interdisciplinary boundaries by testing state-of-the-art theory for the transport properties of strongly-correlated matter, which can be simulated in these cold atom experiments, such as high-temperature superconductors, nuclear matter, and quark-gluon plasmas that are created in heavy ion collisions."
0.148,"During their lifetime plants face many kinds of abiotic and biotic stresses. Major threats include fungal, oomycete, viral, bacterial and nematode pathogens. It is estimated that diseases caused by these plant pathogens reduce plant yield by 10-20% every year. Over millions of years of molecular interactions and co-evolution of host plants and their pathogens, plants developed a sophisticated immune system that senses an impending infection and organizes appropriate defense responses. A key and essential player in this process is the hormone salicylic acid (SA). Although receiving considerable attention from the research community, essential aspects of its role in immunity remain unknown. This project seeks to resolve fundamental new mechanisms through which this major immune regulator achieves its effects. These may provide new strategies for developing disease resistant crop plants. <br/><br/>As a master regulator of plant defense, the protein NPR1 is required for SA-mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and basal defense. In the absence of pathogens or SA treatment, most NPR1 exists in the cytosol as oligomers. After pathogen challenge or SA treatment, NPR1 oligomers are reduced to monomers which enter the nucleus where they function as transcriptional coactivators, binding TGA transcription factors to activate the expression of plant defense genes. Recent publications demonstrated that NPR1 and its paralogs NPR3 and NPR4 bind SA with different affinities and function as SA receptors. In addition, the PI has identified HEN3, a nuclear kinase which is required for NPR1 monomer formation, plant defense gene expression and SAR. Significantly, SA promotes interactions between NPR1 and TGA1/4 transcription factors in a yeast two-hybrid assay, thus supporting the hypothesis that SA and NPR1 activate plant defense through increased protein-protein interactions between NPR1 and TGA1/4. This project seeks to resolve molecular mechanisms that underlie and regulate the function of this key immune signaling hub. Mechanisms to be explored include the role of the HEN3 kinase in regulating NPR1 function, and the effect of SA on interactions between NPR1/3/4 and TGA1/4. The broader impacts of the project include the participation of a postdoc, a graduate student and four undergraduates, including two from groups underrepresented in the sciences."
1.584326,"With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor R. David Britt from the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Davis (UCD) and colleague Neville Luhmann from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCD as well as various senior personnel from California, Oregon, Massachusetts and Florida will develop a pulsed EPR spectrometer that will work at a high frequency (260 GHz), with low power (50 W), and bandwidth (20 GHz) capable of carrying out electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) methods and double electron-electron resonance (DEER). The heart of the spectrometer design is a compact 260 GHz Sheet Beam Traveling Wave Tube (SBTWT) amplifier operating at a voltage of 20 kV with a 1% pulse duty cycle. The design is scaled from that of a 220 GHz SBTWT developed under the DARPA HiFIVE program. An industrial partner (Bridge 12) is also going to be involved. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Importantly, participation of students will allow preparation of the new generation of instrumentalists.<br/><br/>This award will produce an instrument capable of carrying out a series of high impact research in various interdisciplinary fields while involving multiple departments across the United States. The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) using Gd(III)-DPTA labeling; (b) studying mechanisms of activation in proteins of GPCR signal transduction; (c) studying how metals bind to the antimicrobial Calprotectin S100-family protein; (d) using ENDOR to probe a high affinity Mn(II) binding site in the catalytically active Mn-substituted form of the hammerhead ribosome; (e) studying oxidation of Mn(II) in manganese dioxide biomineralization by the bacterial multicopper oxidase MnxG; (f) studying the circadian clock of cyanobacteria; (g) analyzing the effects of metal ion binding in activity of DNA polymerase; (h) studying how metal ion binding affects protein folding and misfolding in a variety of proteins with Cu(II) and Zn(II) binding domains; (i) studying water oxidation and hydrogen reduction catalysts to be employed in solar fuel systems."
0.410118,"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Qing Lin from State University of New York at Buffalo to use a phage-based method to evolve the alkyne-containing peptides for sequence-specific palladium-mediated cross-coupling reactions with aryl iodide reagents, as well as the cysteine-containing peptides for condensation reactions with nitrile-containing small-molecule probes. By exploiting biological techniques such as phage display, the reactivity of up to 600 billion peptide substrates containing unique chemical functional groups can be interrogated. The effect of the sequence of amino acids on the reactivity of the aforementioned peptides will be studied. The structural basis and mechanism of the two bioorthogonal reactions will be probed using kinetic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. <br/><br/>The proposed research seeks to bring new chemical tools to the study of important biological problems. This project addresses important challenges in the development of organic reactions for applications inside living systems, namely the modest reaction rates and specificity of reactions at specific amino acids within peptides and proteins. The research will enhance our fundamental understanding of chemical reactivity in the biological environment, particularly as a function of the sequence of the peptides. The results of the research will be incorporated in courses taught by Dr. Lin. The project will provide interdisciplinary research opportunities to the undergraduate students at State University of New York at Buffalo, including some from the groups underrepresented in STEM careers, through a long-standing collaboration with the New York State Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program."
0.518,"Intellectual Merit<br/>This project will advance the understanding of the role water hydration dynamics in modulating protein flexibility, conformational sampling and biomolecular function. Water hydration is essential in biology and is a critical factor for proper design of engineered materials containing enzymes in biotechnology. The scope of work involves building an Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP) spectrometer with concomitant design and construction of resonators optimized for biological and materials based samples, such that local diffusion dynamics of hydration water surrounding the materials can be interrogated. Insights into the role of water hydration in macromolecular flexibility will be revealed from combined NMR, EPR and ODNP investigations of targeted systems. These include understanding how molecular crowding modulates folding and dynamics in natively unstructured proteins, how mutations distal from active sites in enzymes may influence hydration and hence conformational sampling and dynamics, and how changes in water hydration are coupled to transmembrane signaling of integral membrane proteins. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The technical scientific training in this research spreads across post-doctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students as well as high school students. The project specifically targets recruiting underrepresented high school students into the University of Florida's Summer Science Teaching Program. Three local high school teachers will participate in screening and nominating two students each summer for this six week research immersion experience. These activities would increase public awareness of the scientific research process to communities where these types of opportunities are rare. Other outreach includes training undergraduate students when they enter college in their first year, over a three to four year time period. These efforts are combined with participation in the Beckman Scholar's and HHMI Science for Life programs."
0.024138,"Hybridization, defined as interbreeding between genetically distinct populations, is increasingly recognized as a common occurrence in plants and animals that is important for understanding the speciation process. While most speciation probably results from physical barriers to genetic interchange, this separation is not always absolute and the possibility of hybridization is ever-present. In primates, ongoing hybridization has been identified in most major taxonomic groups and recent studies are increasingly detecting episodes of ancient hybridization in the genomes of living primates, including humans. The mechanisms of hybridization and its role in shaping primate evolutionary histories, however, remain unresolved.<br/><br/>This research by doctoral student Kenneth Chiou (Washington University in St. Louis), under the supervision of Dr. Jane Phillips-Conroy, uses hybridization as a 'natural experiment' for understanding the spatial structure of genetic variation in Kinda and gray-footed chacma baboons, which hybridize in and around Kafue National Park, Zambia. Like humans, baboons inhabit diverse environments, have long life histories and complex social organizations, and share a recent common ancestor, making them ideal models for understanding global patterns of genetic variation in humans. Using the latest DNA sequencing techniques, tens of thousands of markers from across the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are typed from individuals across the hybrid zone. These markers are used to better understand the roles of local adaptation and of differences in social organization in structuring genetic variation within species, between species, and in interspecific hybrids.<br/><br/>This study provides an innovative framework for characterizing the influences of various processes on genetic variation. As one of the first genomic studies of a wild primate hybrid zone, this study increases our understanding of natural hybridization and generates the first genetic data for large areas of a major baboon contact zone. DNA sequence data are deposited in public databases and all software is made freely available under open source licenses. By creating opportunities for collaboration and outreach in both the United States and abroad, this project helps promote scientific literacy and the maintenance of biodiversity."
0.594263,"This award is in support of the Michigan State University Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics. The REU program at Michigan State offers undergraduate students the opportunity to do forefront research in a field of physics---nuclear, condensed matter, high-energy, astrophysics, or biophysics. Each student in the program will work on a well-defined research project under the direction of a faculty mentor. Students choose their projects from a list suggested by the faculty. A wide variety of projects, both experimental and theoretical, are available. In nuclear physics, MSU is the site of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, a major center for the study of the atomic nucleus; student projects may involve detector development, data analysis, or theory. Condensed-matter physics includes research on basic solid-state physics and properties of new materials. High-energy experiments are based at Fermilab and CERN, but REU projects will be done on the MSU campus; examples are data analysis, detector design and simulation, and theory. In astrophysics there is a 24-inch reflecting telescope at MSU, and some REU projects use this telescope while others analyze data from other observatories. At the end of the program each student will write a research report and give an oral presentation on her or his individual project. Throughout the summer the program provides seminars by MSU faculty, field trips, sports and social activities."
0.498454,"The focus of the research component of this project is analytical study of models of reactive processes, such as combustion, taking place in fluid flow. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the mathematical understanding of the effects of flow on combustion. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity and richness of the phenomena continues to present a challenge to our study of this problem. These models are given by nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations which may also be coupled to equations of fluid dynamics. One of the goals of the proposed research is a continuation of previous work on passive combustion in periodic, random, as well as general inhomogeneous media. The main questions of interest include the effects of flows on mixing and on speed-up of propagation of reaction. In addition, simplified models will be considered and experience gained from their study will be applied to the original problems. Another goal of the project is the study of propagation of reaction in a model of active combustion, with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force and gravity-induced mixing. In many situations this effect cannot be ignored, particularly in highly turbulent combustion regimes. Although this is a very difficult problem, limited progress has been achieved recently and it is proposed here to build upon these results. The developed techniques will also be applied to the study of other related models, including systems of reaction-diffusion equations and a model of liquid suspensions.<br/><br/>Reactive processes, such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, and forest fires, are ubiquitous in nature. Their study is relevant to several branches of science and engineering such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering. The research proposed here focuses on the influence of the motion of the underlying medium, such as fluid flow, on the speed of spreading of reactive processes. It aims at improving our understanding of fundamental mathematical models describing such processes, which may provide useful qualitative insights into real life phenomena. An important part of this proposal is its educational component. The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop an undergraduate partial differential equations (PDE) course at the University of Wisconsin, mentor undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of advanced topics, and organize a Research Experience for Undergraduates program in analysis and PDEs. The PI will also teach specialized graduate courses and involve graduate students in working under his supervision."
0.432,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Ti and Zr alloys find extensive applications in transportation and energy technologies respectively in addition to other applications such as in biomedical and chemical industries. Particular needs arise in the basic understanding of the underlying deformation mechanisms in these textured alloys as lower stresses are encountered, comparable to those under service conditions. Recent investigations on fine grained Ti3Al2.5V alloy tubing revealed a new deformation mechanism at lower stresses, under which strain-rates were found to be orders of magnitude higher than those predicted by diffusional creep mechanisms such as Coble creep. In addition, under testing conditions where dislocation creep is predominant, it has been shown that climb of edge dislocations controls creep at lower stresses while jogged screw dislocations make significant contribution at higher stresses. Microstructures following creep are required to differentiate these mechanisms since the measurement of creep parameters such as the stress exponent and activation energy cannot distinguish between them. Further investigations using different loading conditions, on other Ti and Zr alloys, are imperative. These low c/a-ratio hexagonal metals exhibit crystallographic textures that lead to complex biaxial anisotropy that must be properly taken into account. The proposed research addresses these important aspects through studies involving not only standard uniaxial creep tests, but also the characterization of anisotropic biaxial creep using closed-end internally pressurized thin-walled tubing superimposed with axial loading.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Zr and Ti alloys are commonly used as structural materials in the nuclear and chemical industries as thin-walled tubing subjected to complex biaxial loadings. In order to predict the dimensional changes of the structures made from these materials, a thorough understanding of the deformation mechanisms is needed. This is especially true of the changes in the mechanism(s) as lower stresses, equivalent to those under typical operating conditions, are approached. These transitions in time-dependent deformation (i.e., creep) can lead to dangerous non-conservative estimates of the strain-rates and lifetimes by blind extrapolation of the short-term high-stress and high-temperature data to these low levels. The current proposed study emphasizes the transitional creep mechanisms in these important structural alloys. Students exposed to these experimental and modeling efforts will be able to appreciate the complex phenomena that need to be addressed in attacking real life problems. The project will actively participate in Young Investigator programs for high school students during the summers by involving these students in the research."
0.044367,"The recent deployment and integration of more renewable energy sources to the electric power grid coupled with the shutting down of nuclear units in some countries or switching over from coal to natural gas is placing unprecedented stresses on the power grids around the world. The workshop will investigate new developments in the management of power grid to address these challenges. An electricity supply less reliant on fossil fuels is central to any meaningful approach to a sustainable energy future. Encouragingly, renewable generation has grown rapidly in recent years. Internationally for reasons of safety, national security and environmental concern, we see similar trends. These changes all place new demands on the existing power transmission infrastructure. Germany and Japan have some of the most aggressive plans for moving to a low carbon future. <br/><br/>This workshop with the support of the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency and the German Research Foundation (DFG) will bring together researchers and educators in electric energy and sustainability from across the globe to discuss relevant issues to these changes. Topics for discussion include design and operation of AC/DC power system including switching, isolation, and conversion; dynamic and harmonic stability assessment of control systems; power electronic devices, circuits and systems; robustness and survivability; smart energy systems informatics, modeling, simulation and test beds; industry applications; and multinational collaborations.

0.388691,"The International GEOTACES Program is a global study of the marine biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and their isotopes (TEIs). In 2006, the GEOTRACES Science Plan defined the mission of GEOTRACES to be ""To identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distribution of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions"". To achieve this mission, the Science Plan further sets one of the primary goals to be the determination of the global ocean concentration and speciation of TEIs as well as the biological, chemical, and physical processes governing their distribution. Anthropogenic radionuclides (i.e., those associated with nuclear energy production and defence activities) are included in the Science Plan as ""parameters of interest"".<br/><br/>In this project, a research team at the Lamont-Dougherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University will measure water column concentrations of 239Pu, 240Pu, 237Np, and 137Cs in dissolved and particulate phases along the 2013 US GEOTRACES Pacific zonal section from Peru to Tahiti. For much of the study region, these will be baseline vertical profiles of these radionuclides; that is, very few (if any) data on their distribution are currently available. These same anthropogenic radionuclides will also be measured in surface sediments at a few selected sites. Where possible, the team will compare the 2013 data to measurements made in 1972-1973, thus obtaining a four-decade perspective on processes controlling the distribution and fate of these substances.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will feature international collaboration with other marine radiochemists.

0.276365,"1511325(Owkes)<br/><br/>The goal of the proposal is to develop a novel methodology to quantify the uncertainty of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of gas-liquid multiphase flows. While a lot of effort has been spent on developing more accurate numerical techniques for simulations, the important question of the accuracy of computational results in the face of unavoidable uncertainty about fluid properties, boundary and initial conditions, which is present when real life engineering problems are simulated, has not been addressed.<br/><br/>It is proposed to build upon recent developments for single-phase flows in order to couple uncertainty quantification and multiphase flow numerical techniques and to create a rigorous methodology for measuring output uncertainties from input uncertainties. Specifically, a framework for representing a stochastic interface with associated discontinuities will be developed. The PI will couple an interface capturing methods (level set and Volume of Fluid) with intrusive Uncertainty Quantification techniques to develop a stochastic level set method to represent discontinuous gas-liquid interfaces. This framework will be applicable for propagating uncertainty in other applications with discontinuities such as crack propagation in solid mechanics and fluid-structure interactions and will have the potential to change the way engineers study and predict these systems. Applications of multiphase flow occur quite commonly in the process and manufacturing industry. The simulations proposed can have applications to many areas, since a myriad of engineering and environmental flows including fuel injection, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, nuclear power generation, concentrating-solar plants, biological flows, and wave energy harvesting devices are affected by multiphase flows. A dedicated website hosted at Montana State University will provide a central access point to the simulation parameters and data. Numerical codes and results developed during this project will be disseminated through the PI's website and through the library at Montana State University which provides open-access dissemination services."
0.126,"With the installation of the upgraded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) nearing completion, we expect to detect multiple gravitational-wave (GW) sources before the end of the decade. The primary goal of this award is to help ensure that we understand the GW signals as accurately as possible so that we can extract the best science from the expected detections. To do this, the gravitational-wave group at Montclair State University will implement improved waveform templates focusing on (i) binaries with precessing spins, (ii) tidal interactions in binaries containing neutron stars, and (iii) binaries with small orbital eccentricity. These improved templates will be used to quantify the amount of systematic bias in our estimates of the GW source parameters. This bias arises from uncertainties in our knowledge of the actual GW signal. We will also test the effectiveness of simple waveform templates that will search for the GW ""memory"" effect. The memory is a non-oscillatory piece of the GW signal that is particularly evident in signals from supernova explosions and binary black hole collisions.<br/><br/>Gravitational wave detection provides a new and powerful way to observe some of the most violent events in the universe: the collisions of black holes and neutron stars. Observing these collisions with GWs will test our understanding of Einstein's theory of gravity and also probe aspects of nuclear physics that are inaccessible in terrestrial laboratories (such as the nature of ultra-dense matter). This award will advance the effort to model and understand these collisions with high accuracy. Much of this work will involve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students. By applying physics, mathematics, computation, and critical thinking to an important scientific problem, these students will acquire technical skills that are in increasingly high demand. Black holes and general relativity continue to fascinate citizens of all ages. This award includes a strong educational outreach component that communicates the excitement of this field to K-12 students, undergraduates, and the general public."
0.45,"This proposal seeks to make progress in three distinct (and only loosely<br/>related) areas in mathematics. Firstly, in the area of random matrix theory, we seek to build upon recent progress in understanding the fascinating universality phenomenon for such matrices, by generalising the ensembles for which universality can be established, and looking for the underlying mechanisms causing this universality. Secondly, in the area of arithmetic combinatorics, we seek to improve our theory of approximate groups and related structures in noncommutative settings, with potential impact on geometric group theory and finite group theory. <br/>Finally, we wish to extend and understand the exciting new connections between algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and incidence combinatorics which have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the latter subject by applying algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Physical systems are often incredibly complicated, being driven by interactions between countless components of those systems. However, in many cases, a remarkable phenomenon known as universality occurs, in which the macroscopic statistics of the a wide variety of systems are governed by a single universal mathematical law, almost without any regard to how the components of these systems interact with each other at the microscopic level. For instance, the famous central limit theorem in mathematics asserts that many statistics (e.g. the distribution of heights in a human population) are described by a single curve known as the ""bell curve"" or ""Gaussian distribution"". While the central limit theorem is now very well understood, there are other universal laws that are still mysterious, such as the Dyson sine law that has been empirically found to govern such diverse statistics as nuclear scattering, arrival times of buses, and the spacing of the zeta function in number theory. However, we have recently begun to understand this law for a simple class of models known as random matrix models, though even for these models there is still much work to be done. We plan to work on further understanding the underlying causes of universality for random matrix models and related models, with the hope of shedding insight on the universality phenomenon for other models as well.<br/><br/>The second aspect of the research program concerns the phenomenon of expansion in various networks, most famously manifested by the ""six degrees of separation"" experiment of Milgram, that asserts that any two people in the world are linked by at most six degrees of acquaintance. <br/> For a mathematical model of this phenomenon known as a Cayley graph, the existence of expansion is closely tied to the absence of a certain type of mathematical object known as an approximate group. There has been a substantial amount of progress in understanding what exactly approximate groups look like, but the control we have on these groups is still not as precise as we would like. We plan to study the theory of approximate groups further, with an eye towards applications to other areas of mathematics such as understanding the geometry of groups.<br/><br/>Combinatorial incidence geometry is the study of how simple geometric objects such as lines, circles, and points can be arranged together in as efficient a configuration as possible for various purposes (e.g. to try to arrange a given number of points and lines so that as many points lie on as many lines as possible). Understanding the limits of how efficiently one can design such configurations is a basic mathematical question which also has practical applications (e.g. in designing frequency configurations for cell phones in order to maximize capacity and minimize interference). Recently, there has been several breakthroughs in the subject by introducing methods from algebra (particularly algebraic geometry and algebraic topology). This unexpected development is still not well understood; the algebraic methods can solve some problems almost completely, while making no mark on other ostensibly similar problems. We plan to study these methods further and understand exactly what their strengths and limitations are."

This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The cryogenic probe will provide a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students and future female and minority faculty at Cornell University. It will also be used in the introductory chemistry courses by incoming students with poor chemistry backgrounds through an intensive summer bridge course with a long-term goal of retaining them in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors. The instrument will be featured in educational outreach programs to K-12 students and teachers in central New York, and its superior sample throughput enabled by the automatic sample changer will allow multinuclear NMR experiments to be incorporated into undergraduate laboratory curriculum for the first time.<br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) modulating macromolecular self-assembly and enzymatic activity with small molecules; (b) probing chemical signaling mechanisms that regulate life span; (c) tracking the fate of small-molecule phosphorylated compounds that alter proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein; (d) studying allosteric modulation of glutamate receptors through small molecule-induced dimerization; (e) using bottom-up synthesis of graphene nanoribbons and other nanostructured carbon materials; (f) developing polymerization catalysts to prepare polymers with improved properties; (g) characterizing the structure and selectivity of lithium-based Evans enolates; (h) characterizing aggregation behavior of sodium amides and enolates; (i) synthesizing surugatoxins and other complex natural products; and (j) characterizing the structure and reactivity of multimetallic coordination compounds."
0.68,"Accelerators were invented in the 1930s to provide high-energy particles to investigate the structure of the atomic nucleus. Since their invention, there has been a growing list of applications of accelerators both for scientific discoveries and for the benefits of the society. Approximately 30,000 accelerators are currently used to diagnose and treat diseases, to improve manufacturing processes (ion implantation for electronics; hardening surfaces and materials; welding and cutting; and treating waste and medical material), and to address energy, environment and security issues (biofuel production and oil and gas exploration; cleaning flue gases of thermal power plants; and inspecting cargo and improving the monitoring of nuclear test ban compliance). If much brighter (much more intense) beams can be produced via understanding the fundamental issues that govern beam intensity, the accelerators of tomorrow promise greater opportunities. This would require breakthroughs in accelerator science and their translation into applications for the nation's health, wealth and security. <br/><br/>With this award, some of the challenges in achieving much brighter beams will be tackled by the ""Innovations in bright beam science"" team at the University of Chicago. (i) A study will be undertaken to understand the science that underlies dramatic improvements in the quality factor of superconducting, radio-frequency cavities via nitrogen doping. This could reduce capital and operational costs. (ii) A proof-of-principle experiment for accelerators with highly non-linear components will be performed. This could lead to a significant suppression of the instabilities that have plagued intense beams. (iii) New mechanisms will be developed to produce intense X-rays, an indispensable tool for studying the atomic and molecular arrangement of materials."
0.3,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Economic growth and population expansion have led to a rapid increase in energy consumption, intensifying the need for electrical energy storage (e.g., battery) technologies. Lithium-ion batteries are battery technologies having promise in more applications, e.g. in providing high energy and high power in electric vehicles or electrical grids. Recent studies have observed that lithium-ion battery electrode materials (such as TiO2) contain intentional structural defects exhibit enhanced electrochemical charge storage capacity. This project uses irradiation to introduce defects into TiO2 nanostructured electrodes, because irradiation is known to produce an excess of defects in a material. Confirmation of the hypothesis of enhancing battery functionality using irradiation could promote the use of intentional structural defects to profoundly transform battery research, fabrication, and applications. This project may also lead to improved battery functionality through in-service, in situ irradiation in applications subject to high radiation fields, such as satellites and high-altitude aircraft; advanced sensors for security, defense, and power production; remote warfare; nuclear energy and propulsion; and healthcare. Integrated research and education activities will have impacts on undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the general public.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The objective of this project is to determine how and by what mechanisms irradiation affects the electrochemical charge storage of nanostructured TiO2 electrodes. The project addresses the foundational science of the behavior of rechargeable battery systems under irradiation. There is currently limited knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of irradiation effects on charge storage properties of metal oxide electrodes. This research is filling a knowledge gap in intercalation kinetics and structural evolution of metal oxide electrodes under irradiation. Studies suggest structural defects in metal oxides can enhance the material's electrochemical charge storage capacity. Since irradiation is known to produce an excess of point defects in a material, it is hypothesized that irradiation can similarly enhance the charge capacity of metal oxide electrodes. In this project, crystalline TiO2 nanotubes are proton irradiated, then undergo electrochemical cycling with Li. Recent advances in characterization techniques enable the observation of defects and nanostructure following electrochemical cycling. This project integrates experiment and modeling to obtain a fundamental understanding of irradiation effects on charge transport and structural evolution of metal oxide electrodes. Graduate student researchers are gaining technical experience with cutting-edge research equipment and techniques and working in collaboration with national laboratories. Undergraduate student researchers from the Boise State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program are also involved. Topics from this project are being used for curriculum development and outreach programs to middle and high schools."
0.02041,"This study will provide a deeper understanding of the systematics of ferns and the genes that allow them to grow in shady habitats. The presence of neochrome -- a novel chimeric photoreceptor that fuses red-sensing and blue-sensing photoreceptors into a single gene -- is linked to the ability of ferns to thrive in low-light conditions. Despite its potential importance in adaptation, the evolution of neochrome has remained unexplored. This study will investigate the evolution of neochrome and test the hypothesis that the distribution of the gene is the result of recurrent horizontal gene transfer among ferns. This award will support the research and training of a female doctoral student and undergraduate researchers in diverse molecular and systematic methods. <br/><br/>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is common in prokaryotes and is often a key driver of adaptation and evolution. However, most documented examples of plant-to-plant HGT involve mitochondrial DNA and/or parasite-host transfers; only a handful of cases include functional nuclear genes, and even fewer have possible adaptive implications. Consequently, plant-to-plant HGT generally has been overlooked as a noteworthy factor in plant evolution. The aim of this research is to use targeted next-generation sequencing of neochrome from diverse fern species to further elucidate the frequency and timing of the seemingly large number of neochrome horizontal gene transfer events in ferns. Because neochrome may have played a major role in promoting the radiation of ferns under low-light environments, this study has important implications for better understanding the evolutionary significance of plant-to-plant HGT."
0.44,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>Borosilicate glasses are widely used in technology, with applications ranging from heat- and chemical-resistant glassware and reaction vessels, to reinforcement fibers in 'fiber-glass', to computer, television and smart phone display screens and solar-cell substrates. Many of these are central to multi-billion dollar U.S. industries. The atomic-scale structure of these materials controls their properties, which must be tailored to improve performance in their diverse uses. This project seeks to understand general principles of how variations in the glass composition, the way that it is heat-treated during manufacturing, and the pressures that can occur during bending and cracking, change the glass structure, to allow desired properties to be more easily predicted and engineered. The results of these studies should have more general interest as well, in other fields of science where glasses (and the liquids that form glass on cooling) are important, including geosciences and condensed-matter physics. Education is central to this project, since most of the research will be undertaken as part of the training of graduate and undergraduate students on their ways to careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS<br/>In this project, the professor and his students are synthesizing several series of glasses with systematic variations in composition, and then measuring how the glass structure changes. The most important experimental approach that is being used is solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which provides quantitative details about the structure around many of the components common in technological glasses, including boron, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen. By varying the thermal and pressure treatments of the glasses, they can look for important, but still poorly-understood, effects. They are analyzing their findings with thermodynamic-based reaction equilibria to facilitate prediction of properties. Effects of 'non-traditional' components with unusually small and/or highly charged cations are being emphasized. Much of the current development of improved and new types of glass materials comes from trial-and-error experimentation; thus, it is an important goal to develop more fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships to efficiently explore parameter spaces. Success with this goal could lead to more effective ways of thinking about designing glass compositions for new or specific applications. Given the major efforts in glass science in other countries, and the importance of manufacturing high-tech glasses in U.S. industry, it seems particularly urgent for US-based researchers to make progress in the more fundamental understanding of these materials and remain as leaders in this field."
7.812136,"This research project addresses the question of the nature of galactic dark matter with a search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), using two-phase liquid xenon (LXe) Time Projection Chambers (LXeTPCs) as part of the XENON phased program. XENON100, building upon the success of the XENON10 prototype, represents the current state-of-the-art in WIMP search detectors. With a realistic discovery potential, XENON100 has already reached a world-leading sensitivity, and continues to accrue data at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy towards its ultimate sensitivity reach. To fully probe a particularly favorable region of electroweak physics for WIMP dark matter in search of a first robust and statistically significant discovery, the next phase of the XENON program will be a detector at the ton scale - XENON1T. The worldwide race towards direct dark matter detection has been dramatically accelerated by the remarkable progress and evolution of LXeTPCs. They have shifted the scale of target mass from a few to tens of kilograms whilst simultaneously reducing both electronic and nuclear recoil backgrounds to extremely low levels. The XENON collaboration has demonstrated the effective scaling of LXeTPCs with phased detectors of increasing sensitivity of at least an order of magnitude, and is ready to move to the ton scale. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding to the US groups for the construction of the XENON1T detector, cryogenics infrastructure and calibration systems. This experiment is based on a TPC with 2.2 ton of LXe viewed by low radioactivity photomultiplier tubes. By exploiting the excellent self-shielding and 3D position resolution of a LXeTPC, by selecting existing low radioactivity detector materials and by placing the detector in a large active water shield and Cherenkov muon veto, the overall event rate within the fiducial target of 1.1 ton is estimated to be over a factor of 100 lower than the background measured in XENON100. This rate translates to less than one event per ton per year in the WIMP search region - an unprecedented low background level for a dark matter experiment.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The XENON scientific goal to detect the missing mass in the Universe has all the ingredients to captivate the interests and imagination of students and the general public alike. The technological advances of this project can impact society in a number of ways: liquid xenon imaging detectors and related technologies find applications in several fields outside particle astrophysics, including homeland security and medical imaging research."
0.359998,"This project uses the fundamentals of material science to tackle the pressing needs for designing safe and failure-resistant concrete structures for extreme thermal and radiological environments. This approach can have a significant impact on discovering new cementitious materials with improved service life and safety for use in key public infrastructures such as nuclear power plants and oil and gas reservoirs, and will impact several other areas such as safe landing areas for airplanes and tunnel liners exposed to fire. The education program will develop new engineering modules and curricula that will be broadly disseminated to catalyze the fusion of computational material science and extreme conditions. Furthermore, underrepresented students and women will be recruited and retained in STEM areas through the professional Engineering Leadership Alliance at Rice University.<br/><br/>The overarching technical objective is to fundamentally understand the physiochemical degradation processes of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrate (C-S-H), the smallest building blocks of concrete, at elevated temperatures and radiations, followed by utilization of this knowledge to design new intercalated hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN)/C-S-H composites. The underlying methodology lies in developing atomistic simulations connected to advanced synthesis and characterization techniques to understand and control the basic degradation phenomena at the heart of conventional and hybrid cement-based materials. This project will be innovative in its attempts to unravel the complex behavior of C-S-H under irradiation using collision cascade simulations. Intercalation of exfoliated hBN sheets with an optimum thickness into the sub-nanometer basal spaces of C-S-H are novel elements in cementitious materials. The research will link the complex ab-initio scale of chemistry, electron transfer, and radiation- and temperature-induced deterioration processes with the scale of mechanics. As such, this project will potentially lead to a new line of research in cementitious and infrastructure materials."
0.106,"Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 gigaton Cherenkov detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by Cosmic Rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.<br/><br/>Students and postdocs working on this project will benefit by training in particle astrophysics, instrumentation and data analysis of very large data sets. An educational program including high-school students, teachers and undergraduate students will continue. In collaboration with CEISMC and GoSTEM at Georgia Tech the PI and members of his group present lectures and hands on demonstrations on the topics of particle and nuclear physics and astrophysics. <br/><br/>The most powerful events in nature are usually transitory or episodic. Examples are the explosions of massive stars (core collapse supernovae, CC-SNe), high-energy emission by super-massive black holes at the center of galaxies (active galactic nuclei, AGNs), and the very energetic jets that power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This award will support the use of IceCube data to study very-high-energy neutrino astrophysical transients, including GRBs, choked GRBs and, potentially, still unknown types of astrophysical objects. The project will address two topics: a) Are choked GRBs related to CC-SNe and do they produce neutrinos? b) Are the sources of the astrophysical neutrino flux, recently discovered by IceCube, transient? Using IceCube data the Georgia Tech group will search for neutrino transients of one second to one day in duration in the 30 to 300 billion electron-volts energy range. The discovery of a neutrino burst with this search may reveal that CC-SNe and GRBs are part of a continuous class of astrophysical objects and that jets are also a feature of CC-SNe."
0.16,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary ""dark matter"" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/><br/>This award will fund an integrated research and educational program centered on the search for dark matter. Partnerships with a local minority public high school and the Adler Planetarium will genuinely engage students, educators, and the broader public in the mystery of dark matter and the status of current research, via regular classroom visits, field trips, mentoring, teacher immersion experiences, and in-the-museum programming. This will have a deep and broad impact, directly reaching teachers, planetarium staff, hundreds of URM students, and thousands of museum visitors (hundreds of thousands indirectly). The research program offers excellent opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students, making them part of a cutting edge project in fundamental science.<br/><br/>This award will allow the PI to contribute to XENON1T, a direct detection WIMP experiment deployed at the Gran Sasso laboratory built underneath the Apennine Mountains in Italy (LNGS), in the assembly, commissioning and early operations of the detector, scheduled for summer 2015. The PI also plans to develop refined analysis strategies which are expected to enhance the performance of the ionization/scintillation identification methods that are exploited in XENON1T to suppress the dominant / background. To achieve this goal, the PI will make a series of dedicated measurements with a small-scale xenon detector designed to collect pure samples of nuclear and electron recoils. This will permit an exhaustive investigation of the ionization and scintillation processes that govern low-energy interactions in liquid xenon. These data, which are not easily extractable from XENON1T directly, will then be used to increase the sensitivity to WIMPs through improvements in the calibration and rejection of backgrounds."
0.346,"Natural fractures act as major heterogeneities in the subsurface that controls flow and transport of subsurface fluids and chemical species. Their importance cannot be underestimated, because their transmissivity may result in undesired migration during geologic sequestration of CO2, they strongly control heat recovery from geothermal reservoirs, and they may lead to induced seismicity due to fluid injection into the subsurface. Advanced computational methods are critical to design subsurface processes in fractured media for successful environmental and energy applications. This project will address the following key BIG data and computer science challenges: (1) Computation of seismic wave propagation in fractured media; (2) BIG DATA analytics for inferring fracture characteristics; (3) High Performance Computation of flow and transport in fractured media; and (4) Integration of data from disparate sources for risk assessment and decision-making. This will enable design of technologies for addressing key societal issues such as safe energy extraction from the surface, long-term sequestration of large volumes of greenhouse gases, and safe storage of nuclear waste. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a team of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Outreach to high schools teachers and minorities through a planned workshop will inspire interest in environmental green-engineering, mathematics, and computational science. Numerous applications will benefit from this research, including Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Geosciences (GEO), and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will emphasize high performance computation (HPC) approaches for characterizing fractures using large subsurface seismic data sets, BIG data analytics for extraction of fracture related information from seismic inversion results and long-duration dynamic data, and advanced computational approaches for modeling flow, transport, and geomechanics in fractured subsurface systems. The specific objectives are to: Develop an efficient forward modeling algorithm for seismic wave propagation in fractured media using efficient computational schemes. Compute flow and transport in fractured media using an efficient computational scheme implemented on GPUs such as mimetic finite differences. Perform efficient multiphysics simulation of flow and geomechanics in fractured media. Integrate information from time-lapse seismic inversion and flow/transport simulation using novel statistical schemes. Joint inversion of seismic and fluid flow data and uncertainty quantification using efficient computational schemes. Develop and deploy a scalable hybrid-staging based substrate that can support targeted workflows using staging-based in-situ/in-transit approaches.

0.249543,"Project Overview <br/><br/>This project is a collaborative, multi-sited ethnographic study that will examine how the rhetoric used by scientists serves to influence scientific contributions to policy. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The researchers will examine how scientists engage and argue with one another about policy. Specifically, they will collect and analyze the rhetoric used by scientists who are engaged in the development of two types of low carbon energy technologies, wind power and nuclear power, in order to understand how the composition of their reasoning influences energy policy, and how their rhetoric could serve as a productive starting point for integrating scientific knowledge into policy decisions.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The project has societal relevance in terms of training a diverse set of students in social science methodologies and of making the participating scientists aware of the results so as to improve the integration of science in policymaking with respect to the crucial issues of climate change mitigation and energy security."
0.344519,"Intellectual Merit: Cells typically divide at a specific, predictable location. Positioning of the cell division plane in cytokinesis is a fundamental and universal cellular process that has broad relevance to cell morphogenesis, development, tissue architecture, and stem cells. The aims of this research are to determine the molecular mechanisms governing this process. This project utilizes the sea urchin embryo as a potent animal cell model for symmetric cell division. Cell division site determination involves multiple processes. The cell initially positions and orients the nucleus in late interphase along a reproducible axis relative to its cell shape. In this process, the nucleus must somehow sense the shape of the cell. The axis of the interphase nucleus sets the position of the spindle in mitosis, which then specifies the site of cleavage in cytokinesis. The project will focus on the mechanisms of how the nucleus is positioned, how cell shape is sensed, and how the spindle signals to the cortex to specify the division plane. The researchers have recently developed a powerful new approach to study the effect of cell geometry in a systematic manner by manipulating the shape of sea urchin cells by introducing them into micro-fabricated chambers of different shapes (such as rectangles, triangles, etc. The project will include live cell experiments focusing on the identifying the location of and specific molecular motor responsible for nuclear positioning coupled with computational modeling of how the division plane is determined in cells manipulated into different shapes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The researchers continue longstanding efforts to increase the diversity of scientists by broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in science. Efforts will be directed both in the laboratory and in national activities. One of the PI's on this collaborative project is a cell biologist who is also a Native American (Cherokee) who has a long record of involvement in working with a diverse pool of students and in national programmatic efforts. The researchers share a laboratory at the MBL, Woods Hole for about two months each summer where they host undergraduates (mostly from underrepresented groups) recruited nationally at the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) annual conference, from Boston College, and from the NSF funded REU summer program at the MBL. These students are mentored to participate in a number of activities whose aim is to better equip them, should they choose to pursue a scientific career. At the national level, the PI is continuing in a leadership role in programs whose goal is to increase the diversity of scientists including leading NSF supported efforts for SACNAS, for the American Society for Cell Biology and serving in a regular capacity to effect policy change, evaluate programs, and contribute to national activities by service to the AAAS, the NSF, and to colleges, universities and scientific societies."

The high background rejection and control of contamination that SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies, providing world-leading sensitivity to low-mass dark matter, competitive sensitivity to high-mass WIMPS, and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment."
2.944182,"Intellectual Merit: This project will generate the first genome-wide collection of mutants in the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. At least one mutant will be isolated for nearly every nuclear gene. Individual clones, as well as the complete library, will be distributed to the scientific community through the Chlamydomonas Resource Center. The mutant library will allow for the isolation and study of mutants in nearly all genes required for photosynthesis in green algae and plants. Furthermore, the library will also yield mutants in many highly conserved plant genes with putative roles in protein maturation and degradation, signaling, small molecule transport, redox regulation, lipid metabolism, and trace metal homeostasis. More broadly, half of the most widely conserved green plant genes remain completely uncharacterized. This resource will yield mutants in nearly all of these genes, and the study of these mutants will likely reveal entirely new pathways whose critical functions in plant biology are still not appreciated. This resource will also enable breakthroughs in other fundamental processes, including the green algal carbon concentrating mechanism, phototaxis, and the assembly and function of eukaryotic flagella.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Photosynthetic organisms provide energy, oxygen and organic building blocks for nearly all of the life on Earth. Plants are the origin of most of our food and many of our basic materials, and have important potential as a source of renewable energy and industrial chemicals. This mutant resource will lead to advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of plant biology, which will enable future increases in crop yields, the development of next-generation biofuels, and more informed policy decisions as human activities increasingly impact our environment. This resource will dramatically expand our knowledge of green algae, which will facilitate efforts to engineer these organisms for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and renewable fuels, and for bioremediation.

1.0,"Particle physics is focused on the search for the most basic building blocks of the Universe and the rules that bind them. The recently discovered Higgs boson is an excitation of a Higgs field that permeates all of space and gives mass to the other fundamental particles in the Universe. Other fields, such as those that carry the electromagnetic and nuclear forces, interact with this Higgs field, and studying these interactions gives important insight into the properties of the Higgs field. Ironically the interaction of gravity - the force we are most familiar with in our daily life - with the Higgs is hardly understood at all, due to the vast difference in strength between gravity and the other known forces. The Higgs field may also interact with the mysterious material which gravitationally binds our galaxy together, and other as yet undiscovered constituents of nature. The CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider functions as the world's most powerful and sophisticated camera, observing collisions of protons at the highest energies humanity has yet achieved; recording the outcomes for detailed study by CMS experimentalists. The members of the high energy physics group at Rutgers University have been crucial to the construction, maintenance, and continued improvement of the device itself. They have initiated and guided several studies of the data collected, including ones that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The data being gathered now and in the coming years will allow a greater understanding of the basic structure of nature, perhaps including insights into the huge difference in the strengths of the fundamental forces. The Rutgers high energy physics group will continue to be at the forefront of these investigations.<br/><br/>The Rutgers high energy physics group is carrying out several projects at the cutting edge of hadron collider physics with the CMS experiment at CERN, studying proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, the energy frontier. They continue to innovate and implement new data analysis techniques in searches for new physics signatures with leptons, photons, jets and missing energy. The group has a history of leadership in CMS, including service as co-conveners of major analysis groups and leading efforts on detector construction and operations. They work closely with theorists to bring forth new ideas and a rich program of physics analyses and interpretations has originated from their efforts. They plan to continue this innovation and leadership to further improve the capabilities of the detector and data analyses. As the CMS detector ages, upgrades will need to be designed and implemented. This award will allow the Rutgers group to create an improved version of front-end electronics they designed for the pixel detector, as well as helping test and install the electronics for the hadron calorimeter. They are also performing R&D work on longer-term upgrades, specifically the Outer Tracker and a fast Track Trigger. They plan to host a production and testing facility for the upgrades. The Rutgers group hosts a large number of outreach activities which have a broad impact on the community. Through the Rutgers QuarkNet program they run summer workshops at Rutgers for high-school teachers and students. Students and teachers from across New Jersey analyze LHC data and build cosmic-ray telescopes. They mentor undergraduate students from Rutgers and the NSF REU program, as well as qualified high school students. These students work closely with the group's students and postdocs and contribute to ongoing studies and analyses. To combat the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, they are helping develop programs to provide research opportunities to collegiate and pre-college women, and working to increase the participation of women in science. They are active in promoting particle physics programs in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. After feedback from high school physics teachers, they are developing instructional programs for New Jersey high school physics teachers who need help teaching university-level physics courses. They are initiating outreach to the broader community with the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey to prepare particle physics related exhibits.

The major goal is to include significantly improved physical realism than in current models. White dwarf stars are the low-mass endpoints of stellar evolution for stars like the Sun. Many of these are found in close binary systems, and it is well known that such close binaries will merge on time scales of 1 to 10 billion years. White dwarf mergers have recently been proposed as an important additional production channel for Type Ia supernovae, which are the most important probes of the expansion of the universe. The merger process and subsequent explosion requires that a large number of physical processes all be modeled at once, including magnetohydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, radiative transport, and rapidly-changing gravitational fields. These various processes have quite different natural length, time, and density scales, and the level of complexity required for highly realistic modeling of stellar mergers is not achievable in current codes.<br/><br/>The project will require advances in computational techniques. One of the key goals is to improve performance of multi-physics simulations on massively parallel architectures, which is currently limited by problems of scale and overhead in data distribution and resource allocation. The effort will explore the various tradeoffs between overhead and parallelism, and will enable improved strategies in order to enable more efficient and more scalable computation for astrophysical and other problems.<br/><br/>The project is expected to have a broad applicability of the project?s computational techniques beyond the direct problem of stellar mergers. A number of related problems in stellar astrophysics also require integrating the treatment of fluid dynamics, dynamic gravity, thermal and radiative transport, and nuclear energy generation. The group anticipates that the largest direct impact will come in the areas of supernova explosion modeling, the mergers of stars of various types, and stellar evolution when tidal effects and rotation are important."
0.6,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The PIs utilize self-organization reactions to obtain materials that are intrinsically stable under high-temperature irradiation environments. Conventional materials degrade through embrittlement, segregation, creep, and swelling in such environments, caused by the unbalanced flow of point defects to sinks. In order to overcome these detrimental evolutions, self-organization reactions are used here to introduce a high density of stable point-defect traps, thus enhancing recombination. Two separate self-organization mechanisms are considered, involving the competition between ballistic mixing and thermal decomposition, and intra-cascade precipitation. By activating both mechanisms simultaneously, complex core/shell nanostructures are expected with vastly improved stability under irradiation at homologous temperatures as high as 0.80 and with improved mechanical properties. Model Cu-W-X ternary alloys (X = Ag, Fe, Ni) are used to test and validate the approach. Thin films of these alloys are characterized before and after ion irradiation with a combination of techniques, including XRD, TEM, atom probe tomography, and in situ electrical resistivity. Atomistic simulations, including kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that include the creation, recombination and elimination of point defects, are employed to identify the conditions for compositional patterns to remain dynamically stable at elevated temperature and under irradiation. The impact of the program is broadened by developing a new module for a senior laboratory course, highlighting nanoscale precipitation and ordering in thin films, by providing research experience for undergraduates, and by promoting faculty-student interactions and outreach activities through our departmental Material Advantage Chapter.<br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The proposed design for the future generations of advanced nuclear power systems rely on materials that need to operate at elevated temperatures and under prolonged irradiation. Current materials cannot operate safely, reliably, and economically in such harsh environments. The present research program proposes to utilize self-organization reactions to design materials that will produce complex nano-scale precipitates. By judicious choice of alloying elements, these nano-precipitates will be optimized to stabilize the microstructure and the mechanical properties of these materials. The resulting high-strength, high-temperature materials will also be of interest for other energy production systems. The research will provide education for two graduate and two undergraduate students, with an emphasis on advanced materials synthesis and characterization techniques and atomistic modeling. Special effort will be made to recruit female and underrepresented minority students. Outreach activities aimed at encouraging high-school students to pursue STEM careers will be initiated and coordinated with our departmental Material Advantage student chapter."

Physics is foundational to much of the fundamental research activity of US research and development efforts. The Vanderbilt University Summer REU program offers undergraduate physics students the opportunity to work closely with faculty on forefront research projects in a variety of subfields of physics. The areas include astronomy, biological physics, condensed matter physics including nanoscience, laser physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. The research mentors are all well funded researchers and all have committed to personally directing the students. The extensive research infrastructure, including the facilities of several large interdisciplinary centers, will be available to the students. Physics students will have the opportunity to visit major facilities at government laboratories, both domestic and international, including FermiLab, Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, and CERN.<br/><br/>As part of the program's emphasis on leadership development, the program includes training in ethical conduct of research, and as part of the program's emphasis on developing the future workforce includes a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in physics. The REU program will achieve broad impact. In particular, the track record of the program over the past six years shows that a high percentage of the participants will be underrepresented minority students, and the track record moreover shows that more than half of the participants will be from institutions with limited research opportunities. Finally, to achieve sustained impact, the program is designed to build ties between the Vanderbilt mentors, all of whom are supported with appropriate salary, and faculty at the student's home institution. This builds a larger community, provides for continued support for the student, and enhances the ability for continued mentoring and research participation of the student beyond the REU site experience."
0.22,"NON-TECHNICAL PART: The REU Site at Southern Illinois University Carbondale will provide research opportunities for an average of 14 undergraduates per year (including 2 supported internally) for a 9 week period each summer. Students will be involved in interdisciplinary projects in the broadly defined area of materials research. Inclusion of faculty mentors from various disciplines (Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, Microbiology, and the Materials Technology Center) will enable the REU students to develop skills needed to excel in both academic and industrial research environments, where interdisciplinary teams are standard and researchers must communicate effectively across disciplines. Students will also be required to think about the application of their research to new technologies and the manufacturing of new devices, and they will have the opportunity to present their results to a diverse audience. Primary goals of the site include: (1) creating a positive image of science and engineering as a career choice, (2) providing a nurturing environment and instilling a sense of confidence in the art of discussing and practicing science, (3) improving the participants' oral and written communication skills, (4) teaching of basic research tools, including literature searches and the operation of modern instrumentation, (5) fostering a collaborative teamwork approach to research, and (6) increasing the number of domestic students, especially those from underrepresented groups, who choose to pursue STEM careers. A detailed assessment plan will evaluate the success of the activity.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL PART: The Site will recruit primarily from 2 and 4-year institutions residing in neighboring states or the Mississippi Delta region, and from those institutions with traditionally high enrollments of students from underrepresented groups. Students participating in the Site will learn to network with other scientists and engineers through various social activities including weekly lunches with faculty mentors and weekend trips to cultural, industrial, and recreational locations. The available mentored research projects promise to be excellent training grounds for working in materials and related fields. Students will be exposed to a variety of transformative projects at the forefront of science and engineering, including: (1) studies related to the synthesis of advanced functional materials (graphene, two-dimensional layered chalcogenides, metal oxide nanowires and functionalized structures, inorganic heterostructures, nanocomposites, nanoscale catalysts, novel electron-accepting materials, electrospun nanofibers, etc.), (2) materials characterization (via electron microscopies, solid- and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, low-temperature electronic, optical/magnetic transport measurements, ultraviolet/visible/infrared spectroscopies, etc.), (3) theoretical/computational studies (wherein students will learn how to study materials via density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, etc.), and (4) materials applications varying from energy storage and photovoltaics, to biosensors and nanoparticle-based antigen-delivery vehicles."

Specifically, the PI will develop a microfluidic device for reliably separating cytoplasmic and nuclear contents from the same single cells followed by whole-pool amplification of genomic DNAs and messenger RNAs. The amplified products will be retrieved and analyzed using state-of-the-art genomics technology to link single-cell genetic variation to the expression of affected genes across the whole genome. Single-cell, multiplex protein assay and quantitative analysis of cellular behaviors (phenotype) can be integrated within this microdevice to further correlate genes, transcripts to the levels of proteins and cellular functions. The PI will apply this platform to investigating stem cell differentiation and potentially provide new insights needed for understanding how gene expression is regulated to determine stem cell fate and diversity. Such analysis is critical to fully addresse a range of fundamental biological questions such as embryonic development, cancer and immune cell diversity. <br/><br/>This project also acts as a backbone for the integration of research and educational activities spanning from K12 through graduate training, from Yale University through the local community. Integrating microtechnology into biology represents an urgent requirement of expertise for the future health science researchers and medical practitioners. The synergy of research and education will result in the development of a virtual micro-physiologic system lab for demonstration to not only Yale College students but also to the general public, and increase the participation of minorities and under-represented groups.<br/><br/>Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the project, this CAREER award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology."
0.197044,"The broad goal of this research project is to use the tools of topology and geometry to help molecular biologists and chemists better understand the structure and behavior of DNA, proteins, and complex synthetic molecules. The topological model under study would help molecular biologists by simplifying the analysis of the site-specific recombination mechanism for closed circular DNA molecules. The investigator also aims to identify the forms of knots, links, and non-planar graphs that arise in proteins, and to model how these complex structures may have occurred. This information may offer valuable insights into protein folding mechanisms and degradation pathways. Synthetic organic molecules are normally too small to see with an electron microscope; when chemists synthesize a complex structure they use data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to provide evidence that the molecular structure has a particular form. Since these structures are large enough to be somewhat flexible, both topology and geometry have to be taken into account when comparing the symmetry properties of the NMR data to those of a physical model. The investigator is working with organic chemists to identify different types of symmetries exhibited by complex structures and to design new structures with interesting symmetry properties. <br/><br/>In contrast with knots and links, whose topology depends exclusively on their embedding in the three dimensional sphere, the intrinsic structure of some graphs can affect the topological properties of every embedding of the graph in a given three dimensional manifold. For example, some graphs have the property that for any embedding G of the graph in a three-manifold M, there is no orientation reversing homeomorphism of the pair (M,G). Such a graph is said to be intrinsically chiral in M. The investigator will work on characterizing which graphs are intrinsically chiral in the three-sphere and in other three-dimensional manifolds, as well as determining other properties of embedded graphs which are independent of the particular embedding of the graph. The project draws on three-manifold results including Jaco-Shalen and Johannson characteristic decompositions, Mostow's rigidity theorem, Thurstons' hyperbolization theorem, and the classification of Seifert manifolds, as well as techniques from knot theory and the theory of tangles."

This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance. The instrument also allows study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The cryogenic probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. Seven faculty members at UM serve as research project leaders comprising the primary user team. The NMR increases productivity, enables new areas of investigation, and enhances UM as a regional resource for industry. Since the NMR solids capability is not available in the region it has become a resource for regional research-intensive institutions including the University of Mississippi. The automatic sample changer along with internet connectivity allows real experimental results to be integrated in lab curricula for UM and local four-year colleges.<br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studying cancer phototherapy using multifunctional nanocomplexes; (b) studying chemical modification of smart chitosan implants; (c) analyzing chain exchange kinetics and mechanism of tri-block copolymer micelles during sol-to-gel transitions; (d) investigating functional nanoporous membranes; (e) designing of metal complexes for catalytic splitting of water; (f) developing sub-picosecond photoresponsive organometallics; (g) investigating halogen bond-driven assemblies in pi-conjugated oligomers for materials applications; (h) designing sphingosine kinase and diacylglycerol kinase assays; and (i) studying autotaxin inhibitor optimization."
0.418922,"Approximation defines our world. For example, the letters on this screen have smooth curves and bends. But zoom in and all you see are squares: pixels. The smaller the pixels (i.e., the finer the approximation), the smoother a curve looks. Add three colors and suddenly we can approximate a rainbow. In a sense, science is all about refining and improving approximations to reality. Take Newtonian physics, for example. It works great at medium scales, but breaks down when things are too big or too small. Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics work much better at those scales. And these theories require sophisticated mathematics. Operator algebras arose as a framework for quantum mechanics. Over the years many classical theories were extended to this noncommutative context: geometry, topology, probability and more. This focused research group project addresses several outstanding questions in operator algebras and their analogies in other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>The PIs will spearhead an international effort to capitalize on recent connections between operator algebras and other areas such as dynamics, measure theory, coarse geometry and K-theory. Specifically, the PIs shall push analogies between nuclear dimension and asymptotic dimension, two notions defined via approximation and encompassing a huge swath of examples, to address K-theoretic questions such as the Universal Coefficient Theorem and the Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones conjectures."
0.14,"At its most fundamental the physical description of the world around us seems to require two ingredients: elementary particles and interactions between pairs of such particles. For example, photons, the elementary particle of light, can scatter from a single electron and charged electrons will repel each other via the Coulomb force. Even objects that contain many elementary particles seem to interact in pairs. The scattering between atoms, with their many protons, neutrons, and electrons, for example, is often described in terms of interactions between pairs of them. At a bigger scale the motion of the moon, earth, and sun is describable in terms of the gravitational attraction between pairs of them. The composition of the moon, earth, or sun does not matter. This work, however, will focus on the study of three-body interactions, those that are not simply the sum of the pair-wise interactions, but those whose effect is zero when one of the three bodies is removed, and examine their influence on the physical description of the world. This project will train a University of Maryland graduate student. The student will be exposed to quantum physics at a fundamental yet practical level. The proximity to local atomic-physics laboratories, including the Joint Quantum Institute and NIST, will also greatly benefit the student.<br/><br/>In atomic, molecular, and optical physics, there are several cases where three-body interactions are known to matter. For example, in the description of interacting, reacting, and colliding molecules, such forces arise in the so-called Born-Oppenheimer approximation when integrating out the fast electron motion. Conceived in nuclear physics, tri-atomic Efimov states are now studied with ultra-cold atoms at temperatures on the order of a nanoKelvin. Binding of these weakly-bound states crucially depends on a so-called three-body parameter. In all cases three-body interactions emerge when high-energy modes or fast constituents are ""eliminated"" from the description. <br/><br/>This group will design or engineer many-body systems of ultra-cold atoms or molecules held in laser-generated periodic potentials that solely interact through three-body forces. More precisely, starting from a Hamiltonian, where atoms do interact through pair-wise interactions, the investigators will derive effective Hamiltonians that only contain three-body interactions. The ability to freely adjust the periodic trapping potential as well as the strength of the two-particle interactions will be crucial. Research into such effective many-body Hamiltonians has intellectual merit for two separate reasons. Firstly, the research addresses fundamental questions about the origin or emergence of three-body forces. Moreover, for the first time it may be possible to create a realistic system with controllable two-body forces and thereby highlight the role of three-body forces. A second intellectual merit of a design of such a Hamiltonian is that they might have quantum ground states or phases with unique order. For example, it can lead to superfluids with pairs of atoms. This approach relies on controllable cancellations between contributions to the two-body interaction, leaving only three-body interactions. In addition, it relies on time-dependent changes in and driving of the single-particle optical-lattice potential to populate a subset of levels, whose energies simulate three-body interactions. There will be impact in other fields of physics where effective field theories and collective phenomena are important, such as condensed matter and high-energy physics. In particular, with atomic system one can study processes that are fundamental but far-less accessible in systems investigated by those fields."

0.27,"The project studies the interaction of light (mostly lasers) and charged particles (mostly electrons) with atoms, ions, and small molecules. The results are of importance for the understanding of the fundamental collision dynamics, and they also fulfill the urgent practical need for accurate atomic data to model the physics of stars, plasmas, lasers, and planetary atmospheres. The short-pulse intense-laser part of the project deals with accurate solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation on a numerical space-time grid. With the rapid advances currently seen in computational resources, such studies for realistic rather than idealized model systems have only become possible in recent years. This work is important for further developments in imaging and ultimately controlling of submicroscopic reactions, which is expected to have broad impact by reaching out from physics to chemistry and ultimately biology. Many experimental efforts worldwide are supported through the present project, which will also train a post-doctoral associate and a number of research students in the basic understanding of the problem and the use of highly sophisticated numerical techniques.<br/><br/>Most of the numerical calculations will be based upon the non-perturbative R-matrix (close-coupling) method, as well as direct solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation using various grid-based approaches and basis-function expansions. For single and double ionization of complex atoms by intense atto/femto-second laser pulses, the methods will be combined in such a way that individual parts of the ""big problem"" can be treated in highly efficient and optimized ways. This strategy will be extended to the treatment of double ionization involving inner shells as well as diatomic molecules. Of particular interest will be the highly challenging, but ultimately necessary simultaneous treatment of the nuclear and electronic motion. There are major difficulties associated with both the formulation of the problem and the subsequent numerical treatment. Much emphasis will be placed on the testing of numerical methods and the visualization of the results, both of which are ideal for student involvement."
0.216,"As critical applications are converging onto the Internet, effective response to large-scale network dynamics like failures and demand spikes is gaining more importance. Major portion of the time for handling such network dynamics is determining how to respond, mostly performed manually in the current practice. Experienced human administrators are typically the ones who can quickly find a close-to-optimum response. However, as the networks are getting larger and more diverse, managing and attaining effective responses for an online operational network necessitates meta-tools to swiftly learn and characterize the network. <br/><br/>This project will develop tools for automated management of a running network by framing heuristic optimization, empirical learning, experimental design, and network management with a simulation interface. The project will develop an online management and experimentation system for large-scale networks in an environment that enables trainee administrators to explore what-if scenarios, without having to risk the network operation. The project will also develop algorithms for empirical characterization of network dynamics, and tools for quick and close-to-optimal configuration of numerous network parameters in response to failures or customer traffic trends.<br/><br/>The project will integrate behavioral scientific concepts into the practice of operational network management. The automated management using online optimization may establish a foundation for managing multi-owner systems, e.g., power grid, transportation, and water infrastructure networks.

Neutron stars are city-sized objects that form out of the gravitational collapse of massive stars during a supernova explosion. Magnetars are fast-spinning and highly magnetic neutron stars that may have ultra-powerful eruptions in just a few hours. Their formation is still a mystery, but these short-lived outbursts are proposed to be the cause of many mysterious gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernova explosions in the universe. The main focus of this work is to develop a prediction from the theoretical models that will be tested by observations. The PI will train and mentor undergraduate students in research and organize a two week long international summer school on ?theoretical modeling of astrophysical transients,? which will teach students how to analyze the physical properties of short-lived observed astronomical phenomena. <br/><br/>The PI and his team will develop models of the neutrino-heated outflows from newly-formed protomagnetars.

0.42769,"The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that deteriorate the mechanical properties of geomaterials subjected to environmental forcing, as well as of the deformation/failure events potentially triggered by such alterations. In particular, the project aims to formulate novel theoretical approaches to quantify the risk of failure induced by multi-physical agents, link theories with predictive models and use these tools for interpretation and design purposes. To achieve these goals, the project will combine a range of methods to enhance the physical foundations of geomechanical modeling frameworks, thus improving their ability to predict homogeneous and localized deformations initiated by multi-physical processes. More specifically, the project will involve energy methods for detecting the onset of instabilities during non-mechanical forcing, innovative bifurcation analyses for assessing the performance of constitutive formulations, computational analyses to identify possible sources of heterogeneity induced by transient phenomena and a novel strategy to couple the evolution of the mechanical properties with the hydrologic, thermal and chemical processes modifying the microstructural characteristics of a geological solid. The research activities will be integrated with a dedicated educational plan, with the purpose to coordinate education, training and outreach efforts. The planned initiatives will involve a wide range of users, ranging from graduate and undergraduate students to practitioners, local high schools and the general public. Such a wide audience will be engaged through a number of activities, including the development of e-learning tools, the involvement of undergraduate students in research and internationalization activities, the organization of workshops for local high-school teachers and the global dissemination of the research findings. <br/><br/>Given the pervasive distribution of multi-physical processes in the natural environment, the research findings resulting from this project can benefit the society by supporting the quantitative assessment of environmental risks, as well as the safe and sustainable implementation of numerous technological activities. In particular, the tools and methods formulated by this project will assist engineers and geoscientists in the interpretation, monitoring and prediction of critical events in geotechnical and geophysical contexts. Prominent examples are the forecasting of natural hazards, the management of aging infrastructures, the optimization of energy technologies and the underground storage of hazardous substances (e.g., nuclear waste or carbon dioxide). As a result, the findings of the project can have an impact on a number of neighboring disciplines, such as reservoir engineering, environmental engineering, geophysics, engineering geology and geomorphology. In addition, the future incorporation of the above mentioned advances in the technological practice can yield long-term benefits for a number of challenging societal problems, such as the pressing need for durable infrastructures, the reduction of casualties and property loss in urbanized areas, the safe supply of natural resources and the safeguard of public investments in the area of environmental sustainability."

0.329503,"Modern society increasingly depends on the work of interdisciplinary teams using information and communication technology (ICT) to control complex systems with high reliability (for example, in airplane cockpits, traffic control rooms, and nuclear power plants). Engineered systems such as these are deterministic, with well-defined states and parameters of normal operation which allow control teams to achieve their goals through direct interaction with ICT. But when the focus is a natural (i.e., social or living) system rather than a machine, the control task imposes quite different cognitive demands which make the design, development, and integration of ICT more challenging. High-risk, fast-response medicine is an example of a work environment that deals with a natural system (the patient), where the need for effective ICT support is as high as for engineered systems. The goal of this research is to develop innovative approaches for real-time information presentation to support situation awareness and collaborative work by fast-response, interdisciplinary medical teams. In particular, the PI will examine how context-specific information should be presented to support such teamwork while accounting for team members' perceptual and cognitive limitations. To this end, she will focus on the team-dependent and information-intensive processes of evaluating critically ill patients in the high-risk medical domains of pediatric trauma and emergency resuscitation. The research will involve field studies, video review of medical events, design and development of display prototypes, and evaluation. Project outcomes will include conceptual and empirical understanding of awareness in fast-response medical teamwork, approaches for augmenting distributed cognition through interactive displays, lessons from the development of display prototypes for improving awareness of rapidly unfolding events and their progression, and lessons from evaluating such prototypes in real-world settings.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research will contribute to and inform diverse scientific fields, including information presentation in dynamic environments that rely on interactive information presentation, human-computer interaction where work conditions limit direct interaction with information systems, and the automatic capture and integration of data arriving from multiple sources.

0.54091,"INTELLECTUAL MERIT<br/>Mitochondrial ribosomes synthesize a small, but functionally important subset of proteins. Although evolutionarily related to bacterial ribosomes, mitochondrial ribosomes display some mechanistic and compositional differences from their prokaryotic counterparts. Mitochondrial ribosomes are entirely membrane-anchored, whereas in bacteria the ribosomes cycle between soluble and membrane-anchored populations. The mitochondrial ribosomes display a higher protein:rRNA content and this is largely attributed to (i) the presence of ""mitospecific"" extensions on many ribosomal proteins in addition to their bacterial homology domains, and (ii) the presence of novel mitochondrial-specific ribosomal proteins. The role of the mitochondrial-specific ribosomal proteins/domains in ensuring that the assembly and activity of the ribosomes is tethered to the membrane is largely unexplored and represents a long-term goal of this research. The elucidation of mechanisms of mitochondrial ribosome assembly and regulation have important implications for the fundamental cellular questions concerning protein translation systems and will address how mitochondrial ribosomes have evolved in composition and function from their prokaryotic ancestors. This research project will directly address how the mitochondrion coordinates its translational activity with the biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation system, a process which requires the uniting of proteins encoded by nuclear genes with the mitochondrial gene products. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS<br/>A major objective of this project is to continue to provide innovative and transformative research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students at Marquette University. The proposed research activities will provide a training platform for student researchers in many aspects of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology. Undergraduate students, by working alongside graduate students, will become active members of a close scientific research and mentoring community. Students will also be encouraged to present their work at national research meetings and to publish their findings, goals which will also hone their scientific writing and communication skills. By exposing students to the excitement of inquiry-based biological research early during their undergraduate tenure, it is hoped to increase the number of students electing scientific research careers following graduation. Finally, exposing students to innovative research in closely mentored research environment will be instrumental for increasing their engagement, awareness, and appreciation for the importance of scientific discovery and rigor in society today."
0.257467,"Non-technical abstract: <br/>Thermal expansion is a property that all materials possess and most commonly occurs as a volume increase in response to a temperature increase. However, recent new materials discoveries have revealed instances of negative thermal expansion (NTE), a peculiar phenomenon of heat-induced volume contraction. NTE materials are not currently used in industrial contexts, but hold strong application potential in stabilizing telecommunication components, as elements of electronic devices benefiting from thermally controlled stresses, and the potential to form rigid composite structural materials with engineered thermal properties. This project uses light- and X-ray-based spectroscopy to study excitations driving the NTE effect in a representative set of materials with the goal of achieving an understanding capable of leading new material discovery efforts. Training of the next generation's high-tech workforce through both graduate and undergraduate participants performing experimental activities at Connecticut's flagship state university and national user facilities is an integrated component of the project.

Educational development for students and by students, guided by departmental faculty and staff, is a central theme of the Doc-cam demos project.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: <br/>The past 10 years has seen an accelerated rate of discovery of materials with robust and sizable negative thermal expansion (NTE). The goal is to advance our understanding of NTE associated with dynamics of tightly bound, stiff molecular units and local atomic arrangements allowing for strong nuclear lattice fluctuations in a direction transverse to a structural linkage defining the unit cell. Because thermal expansion of any sign is necessarily an excited state effect and involves anharmonic interactions, the basic science motivation surrounds the likely possibilities that strong quantum fluctuations, rotational tunneling, and many-body nonlinear localization play a role in this remarkable effect. Inelastic X-ray scattering, infrared and terahertz absorption spectroscopy, and thermal transport measurements will be performed in a select subset of recently discovered NTE materials whose structures have related features, including members possessing the important perovskite structure. Detailed study of Brillouin zone boundary and zone-center modes believed to contribute will be assessed and compared across materials classes. Educational activities involve training a new generation of scientists through a novel project permitting advanced science majors to exercise their creative potential by developing new document camera demonstrations for use in large lecture settings. This curricular effort flips the demo room in the spirit of peer instruction and other recent science teaching innovations."
0.442368,"In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Christian Wolf of the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University will develop practical dual-mode chemosensors that produce distinct circular dichroism (CD) signals combined with either a UV or a fluorescence response that can be used for rapid determination of the absolute configuration, enantioselectivity, and yield of a large variety of chiral compounds. The envisioned sensors and current leads are designed to exploit substrate recognition and chirality amplification events for quantitative real-time analysis, and will address common drawbacks of chirality sensing, including slow response time and elaborate substrate derivatization prior to analysis. The introduction of robust chirality chemosensing assays is expected to increase the productivity of many laboratories by providing practical, time-efficient and cost-effective screening tools that streamline current asymmetric reaction discovery and optimization protocols while minimizing waste production and energy consumption. This interdisciplinary research program will train the next generation of scientists and be conducted by a team of graduate, undergraduate and local high school students. An industrial partnership with Merck in Rahway, NJ, and several international collaborations that address several aspects of the chirality chemosensing development will enhance the local research and education infrastructure.<br/><br/>The project involves the in-depth analysis of the operational mode, kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of the substrate binding event, the substrate-to-sensor chirality imprinting process, and the ultimate chiroptical sensor response. In parallel to the development of stereodynamic probes that operate based on covalent substrate binding, stereodynamic metal complexes and other probe designs that incorporate noncovalent interactions with the chiral target compounds will be explored. These directions will include new molecular recognition and chiral amplification motifs and further extend the general scope of chirality sensing. In these cases, systematic sensor developments will go hand in hand with detailed mechanistic studies using NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), ESR (Electron Spin Resonance), MS (Mass Spectrometry), X-ray, UV (Ultraviolet), CD (Circular Dichroism), fluorescence and in situ IR (Infrared) in combination with titration and competition experiments. The investigation of real case applications, i.e. the direct analysis of asymmetric reactions, will also be pursued."
0.13561,"The PI plans on studying several projects on zeros of L-functions, as well as problems in additive number theory. The main research concerns the behavior of zeros near the central point. While these zeros have been known to be related to arithmetic problems since Riemann, in the last few decades connections have been observed with high energy nuclear physics and random matrix theory (RMT) as well. Thus investigations in one of these topics can be fruitfully used in the others. The additive number theory problems have a similar flavor; many of them concern density of states as well as gaps between events. Similar techniques are used in the analysis here as in some of the number theory and random matrix theory investigations. Specifically, the PI proposes to study: (1) the n-level densities of low-lying zeros of GL(2) L-functions (including level 1 Maass forms and increasing the support for holomorphic cuspidal newforms by deriving alternatives to the Katz-Sarnak determinantal expansions that are more amenable for comparing number theory and random matrix theory), (2) the n-level densities of Dirichlet and number field L-functions (which involves exploring and extending our understanding of the finer properties of the distribution of certain classes of primes), (3) finding random matrix theory analogues to Rankin-Selberg convolutions (to extend the predictive ability of RMT), (4) additional consequences of the L-function Ratios Conjecture and other arithmetic conjectures, (5) the density of states and behavior of the eigenvalues of structured random matrix ensembles (with special emphasis on the resulting combinatorics, which is frequently related to other problems of interest), (6) generalized Zeckendorf decompositions and the gaps between summands, (7) generalized sum and difference sets (especially phase transitions from different models of randomness, behavior in subsets of highly structured sets, and results in non-abelian cases), and finally (8) Benford's law of digit bias.<br/><br/>The central questions in this proposal involve studying how events are distributed in diverse systems, such as energy levels of heavy nuclei, prime numbers and zeros of L-functions, leading digits in sets of data, and summands in generalized Zeckendorf decompositions. Similar to the Central Limit Theorem, there seem to be a few universal spacing laws that govern these and other phenomena; thus studies in one of these topics can frequently provide useful insights in the others. Understanding these systems requires the development of tools and techniques in complex analysis, Fourier analysis, number theory and probability. Some of the projects have real world applications; for example, the IRS uses Benford?s law to locate corporate tax fraud. Many of these projects have components that are amenable to numerical experimentation; these and tractable special cases will be investigated with undergraduate research assistants. The PI will also continue his extensive work in math education. In addition to providing numerous mentoring opportunities to his students (such as arranging for them to referee for journals, write reviews for MathSciNet, write expository articles for journals, and co-organize AMS special sessions), the PI will also involve them with expanding his math riddles page (http://mathriddles.williams.edu/). This site is frequently one of the top hits when searching for math riddles, and is used in junior high and high schools around the world to excite students to mathematics."
0.4,"Accelerators are used in many applications, from studies of the fundamental components of matter to medical and industrial applications. The advancement of accelerator technology relies on a deep and detailed understanding of the behavior of the particle beam inside the accelerator. Sophisticated simulation codes have been developed to model the particle beams in the accelerator in order to aid in understanding particle beam behavior in current accelerators, and in the design of future accelerators. To produce accurate results, the simulations require an initial description of the beam that is beyond what has yet been experimentally measured. The deficit of knowledge in this area places a fundamental limitation on progress toward understanding the beam behavior in accelerators, particularly in high power accelerators. The main difficulty in acquiring this information is the extensive time associated with performing the experimental measurement, which renders it impractical or impossible for operational accelerators, and the necessity for developing the novel diagnostics device capable of performing the full multi-parameter measurement. In this project, the University of Tennessee will make use of the Integrated Test Stand Facility (ITSF) at the Spallation Neutron Source accelerator in order to perform the first comprehensive measurement of the initial beam properties. The ITSF is a duplicate of the first piece of the SNS accelerator, and therefore provides a realistic platform for this measurement but without the time limitations associated with operational accelerators. This project will fund one postdoc, one graduate student, and a few undergraduate students from the University of Tennessee to design and implement the necessary equipment on the ITSF to perform the measurement, under guidance from staff at UT and at SNS. The project will enable these young scientists to gain hands-on experience in hardware design and data analysis, while also making an important scientific contribution. Almost all accelerators, from high-energy particle physics machines to future accelerators for transmutation of nuclear waste and energy production, will benefit from the results of this work.<br/><br/>For any linear accelerator, the quality of the beam in the front end limits what can be achieved downstream; a poor quality beam early on results in unwanted emittance growth and beam halo. One of the holy grails of accelerator physics is quantitative modeling of the onset and evolution of beam halo and it?s translation into beam loss during acceleration. Unfortunately, there is a recurring failure of state-of-the art simulation codes to successfully benchmark anything beyond RMS quantities of the beam. Since it is the extended beam tails that cause beam loss in an accelerator, this is a performance-limiting issue. The consensus in the community is that the problem is not a failure of the codes, but rather a deficit in knowledge of the initial beam distribution. To date, there has never been a full 6D measurement of the beam phase space exiting the front-end radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ). The thrust of the work is a modest expansion of the diagnostics to enable the first full 6D measurements of the beam phase space, and small modifications to allow subsequent measurements of the downstream evolution of beam. A final goal is to optimize the diagnostics schemes in operational accelerators to improve the ability to reconstruct initial beam phase space distributions. The extended ITFS will serve as a community-wide resource for understanding halo formation and improving measurement and modeling techniques; interested colleagues will be given the data and invited to perform their own experiments."
0.02002,"Interactions among species are driving forces behind the formation, structure and existence of ecological communities. In these communities, species interact with one another, compete for resources, and ultimately shape the existence and distribution of biodiversity on Earth. A central question of evolutionary biology is how these ecological communities came to be, and how long these interactions have persisted. This research will provide a new tool for understanding if ecological communities have persisted over evolutionary time scales, and to what extent the co-occurring species show similar patterns in their genetic diversity. If ecological communities exhibit strong patterns of a shared evolutionary history, the extinction of a single member may be dire for other ecologically associated species. Understanding these attributes will provide insight into how species responded to the dynamic landscape and climatic changes during the Pleistocene ice ages, and will help conservation managers identify regions in need of protection. <br/><br/>This research aims to develop phylogeographic concordance factors, a novel statistical approach testing for co-diversification in an ecological community. This synthesis will identify common diversification patterns across species as well as species that do not conform to these patterns. Phylogeographic concordance factors take in species tree distributions from multiple co-occurring species, and identify patterns shared among the clades. These clades are then used to construct a concordance tree, providing a phylogeny with support values that best represents diversification patterns of the community. Importantly, this method will identify species that are outliers of a dominant pattern. Along with developing the method as a package for the statistical platform R, this approach will be demonstrated in the Sarracenia alata carnivorous pitcher plant system. This system is located in the topographically and geologically complex region of the southeastern United States, where a number of previous studies have documented emergent biogeographic patterns. Mitochondrial data from five arthropods from this community indicate that genetic variation has been structured in a similar way to the host plant, but preliminary sequence data generated from the nuclear genome implies a more complex evolutionary history for this system, making the system ideal for studies using phylogeographic concordance factors. This new tool will enhance the ability of researchers to identify shared patterns of diversification, and the evolutionary processes that have influenced biodiversity."
0.098786,"PI: Stephan, Matthias <br/>Proposal Number: 1452492<br/><br/>Medicine currently lacks an intervention that can rapidly educate the immune system to eliminate diseased cell populations, such as those produced by cancer or virus infections. For example, although vaccines can train the immune system to selectively destroy diseased cells without damaging healthy tissue, they may require months to elicit responses, by which time the condition can become lethal. To address this problem, the project proposed here merges concepts from materials science, immunology, and gene therapy to create injectable reagents that can quickly reprogram circulating immune cells to recognize and destroy tumors. Specifically, it tests the hypothesis that targeted, gene-bearing nanoparticles can genetically reprogram circulating T cells to express receptors that recognize tumor targets, so they can rapidly eliminate them. Early results based on laboratory-raised lymphocytes already establish that a novel nanoparticle configuration can efficiently transfer tumor-reactive receptor genes into these cells. The results of the project could be transformative, by creating a basis for developing a repertoire of gene modification systems customized to rapidly generate immunity against any targetable pathogen; using these, treatment of cancer or viral infections could begin immediately following diagnosis by simply applying the appropriate nanoparticle reagents. Also, as an alternative to immunizing populations to protect against uncommon diseases, nanoparticle programming of immune cells could provide this protection ""on demand."" Thus, the project may impact public health by enabling rapid responses to outbreaks and epidemics. In addition, the investigator's interdisciplinary team of chemists, bioengineers and immunologists will directly integrate this research into a variety of teaching and educational outreach programs to provide K-12 students and their teachers with real-world-based, state-of-the-art learning experiences concerning how developments in biomaterials can impact medicine.<br/><br/>Vaccination evolved into one of the most important therapies of modern medicine, and advances in nanotechnology have provided tools that can amplify immune responses to vaccines. However, even though vaccines can create T cells with defined specificities, they do so slowly and often produce insufficient numbers to control established disease. To date, no methodology is available that can rapidly educate the immune system to destroy diseased cells. This project proposes to develop an injectable synthetic vehicle that can quickly reprogram circulating T cells to recognize and destroy diseased cells. It will test the hypothesis that these lymphocytes can be genetically reconfigured by targeted, gene-bearing nanoparticles to express disease-recognizing receptors, enabling them to bring about rapid rejection of erratic cells. Pilot in vitro studies already establish that efficient transfer of leukemia-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) genes into lymphocytes can be achieved via appropriately engineered nanoparticles. The long-term project goal is to develop a broad repertoire of injectable gene modification systems customized to treat diverse conditions. This goal will be pursued via three specific aims: (1) optimize the design of a nanoscale gene delivery system that achieves persistent and robust transgene expression in proliferating T cells; (2) investigate how internalization of polymeric nanocarrriers affects T cells at the molecular level; and (3) measure how the introduction of specific receptor genes into circulating T cells induces disease regression in mice. DNA encoding a TCR specific for the Wilms tumor antigen will be encapsulated in lipid bilayer-coated porous silica nanoparticles, which will be selectively targeted to circulating T cells by coupling anti-CD3 antibodies onto them. Initial experiments will determine whether stable receptor expression can be achieved in dividing lymphocytes by inserting into the TCR gene a Scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/MAR) sequence, which enables plasmids to self-replicate as episomes. The possibility that nuclear localization signals will increase gene transfer into T cells will also be investigated. Detailed gene expression profiling will clarify how nanoparticle uptake affects lymphocytes at the molecular level. The therapeutic potential of the technology will be tested in leukemia-bearing mice receiving systemic injections of DNA nanocarriers at different doses and frequencies, and the percentage of reprogrammed T cells in the peripheral blood will be quantified by flow cytometry. Differences in tumor progression between treatment groups will be measured using serial bioluminescence tumor imaging. Technologies arising from the project could potentially impact any disease that has a defined antigen for receptor targeting. They are based on a novel scheme that can quickly induce active immunity ""on demand"", and the therapeutics involved are amenable to rapid distribution, simple storage and easy application. Considering the shortcomings of conventional immunotherapy, this approach could evolve into a new biotechnology arena with broad applications. The research will also be directly integrated into educational programs promoting awareness of career opportunities at the interface of materials science and immunology."
0.702223,"The genetic code of every living organism is contained within chromosomes, referred to collectively as the genome. In all eukaryotes, the genome is compacted into the nucleus through the formation of condensed molecules known as chromatin. The smallest individual units of compaction are known as nucleosomes that are comprised of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of small basic histone proteins. In order for regulatory factors and enzymes to access the genetic code and properly regulate processes essential for normal development and cell survival, the nucleosomes need to be moved aside or directly modified on specific amino acid residues in a process termed chromatin remodeling. The enzymes and other proteins that carry out chromatin remodeling are ancient and remarkably conserved, with increasing complexity from single celled organisms up through vertebrates. The overall impact of this project will be a better understanding of how chromatin remodeling controls expression of the information that is encoded within the genome. In addition, high school, undergraduate and graduate students will participate in mentored research. Women and minorities will be highly represented. Multidisciplinary training and education are vital to prepare for diverse science careers and this project employs the unique tools currently available for Drosophila studies. Students will be trained in molecular and developmental genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and bioinformatics, structural and developmental biology. The project will enhance interactions among faculty scientists within the institution and with students at multiple undergraduate institutions to explore the rapidly emerging field of bioinformatics. Undergraduate students will be tasked with learning new informatics tools and approaches using experimental data derived from this project. <br/><br/>In order to define the histone recognition and binding properties of Cmi and related mammalian domains and elucidate the potential mechanism of COMPASS-like complex targeting to gene enhancers, collaborative structural studies that include X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance of the histone recognition domains and targeted mutagenesis combined with in vitro measurements of binding affinities and in vivo chromatin association will be employed. The project also uses next-generation high throughput chromatin and RNA analyses (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq) and target gene studies. ChIP-Seq using chromatin from cmi mutant animals will enable correlation of epigenetic marks with Cmi function and align the RNA-Seq gene expression data with chromatin binding to address key developmental functions. Tissue-specific targeted removal of both cmi and trr and overexpression of cmi using unique genetic tools developed for these studies will allow for direct testing of COMPASS-like functions on target genes. Leading edge chromatin technologies that examine physical connections between distant gene regions will elucidate novel regulatory roles for the Drosophila COMPASS-like complex in facilitating enhancer-promoter communication necessary for proper gene control. These studies will help to reveal essential and foundational properties of chromatin remodeling and modifying complexes and provide critical insight into the mechanisms of developmental gene regulation."

0.39,"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program is funding the research of Kenton H. Whitmire of Rice University to develop new ways to make advanced metallic substances with potentially useful magnetic properties. The work is focusing on materials made from metals such as iron or manganese. When these metals are combined with a substance such as phosphorus, the two can come together in many different forms. Iron combined with phosphorus, for example, can form in at least five ways. All of these resulting substances are different, but they all are semiconductors, some of which display unusual behavior. One of these is called ""magnetocaloric"". This means their magnetic state varies with temperature. Substances like this could be used to produce an electronic refrigerator, in other words, a solid-state device that does not require the use of refrigerant gases. This work is, thus, having a broad impact: on the production of new and potentially important materials that will find a wide variety of uses in industry, and through the training of the next generation of scientists in advanced techniques for preparing specialized materials.<br/><br/>This research is developing new ways to prepare advanced materials that are difficult or impossible to synthesize by conventional means. In order to achieve this goal, new molecular precursors combining one or more transition metals (M) with the group 15 elements (E) are being prepared. The resulting E-M compositions have important magnetic, electronic and/or superconducting properties. This project is geared to overcoming the synthetic challenges of preparing advanced materials of binary, ternary and higher transition metal/main group element compositions. The approach considers single source precursors based on transition metal carbonyl compounds containing one or more transition metals as well as phosphorus and/or arsenic. The molecular precursors are prepared using sophisticated organometallic techniques to achieve the desired E/M compositions. These compounds are characterized by a variety of methods including single crystal X-ray diffraction, multinuclear and variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry among others. The conversion of these precursors to the desired materials is examined by thermal decomposition methods. The resulting materials, prepared either as nanoparticles or thin films, are analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder and film X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and other electronic and magnetic measurement techniques."
0.549991,"Agglutinated foraminifera (forams for short) are early-evolving, single-celled organisms. These ""living fossils"" construct protective shells using sediment grains held together by adhesive substances that they secrete. During shell construction, agglutinated forams display amazing properties of selection - for example, some species build their shells of clear quartz grains, while other species use only grains of a specific size. Understanding how these single cells assemble complex structures may contribute to nanotechnology by enabling people to use forams as ""cellular machines"" to aid in the construction of nano-devices. This project will analyze the genomes of at least six key foram species, and then ""mine"" these genomes for technologically useful products and processes. The project will focus initially on the adhesive materials forams secrete, which may have wide application in biomedicine and biotechnology. Furthermore, the work will further develop a molecular toolkit which could open up new avenues of research on the physiology, ecology, and population dynamics of this important group of Antarctic organisms. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists. Educational experiences related to the ""thrill of scientific exploration and discovery"" for students and the general public will be provided through freely-available short films and a traveling art/science exhibition. The project will also provide hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Explorers Cove, situated on the western shore of McMurdo Sound, harbors a unique population of foraminiferan taxa at depths accessible by scuba diving that otherwise are primarily found in the deep sea.

It will also use next generation sequencing methods to characterize the in-situ prokaryotic assemblages (microbiomes) of one of these groups and compare them to reference sediment microbiomes. The phyogenomic studies of the targeted Antarctic genera will help fill significant gaps in our current understanding of early foram evolution. Furthermore, comparative genomic analyses of these six species are expected to yield a better understanding of the physiology of single-chambered agglutinated forams, especially the bioadhesive proteins and regulatory factors involved in shell composition and morphogenesis. Additionally, the molecular basis of cold adaptation in forams will be examined, particularly with respect to key proteins."

This project integrates three broad approaches in a study of grass diversification using contemporary methods to reconstruct the genealogy of the grasses. Next generation DNA sequencing methods will be used to determine complete chloroplast genomes and subregions of the nuclear genome from at least 100 species. Bioinformatics analyses will explore patterns and rates of DNA sequence evolution. Studies of development, especially in leaves, will be used to test whether particular adaptations are correlated with historical migrations into new habitats. <br/><br/>Grasses are of fundamental economic and ecological importance. Rice, wheat, maize and other cereals supply half of human dietary calories. Wild grasses predominate over 25% of Earth's terrestrial landscape. A better understanding of their relationships is fundamental to predicting the response of grasslands and cereal crops to environmental change. Analyses of sequence data will clarify relationships and have broad application in evolutionary studies. Ecological adaptations will be better understood when viewed in a developmental context.

0.444649,"Non-technical Abstract<br/>Historically, the development of new tools to 'see' inside opaque solids has been an important driver of progress in science and technology, with far-reaching economic impact. This project is developing new approaches to a long-standing goal in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), namely, multinuclear MR images of hard and soft solids with high spatial resolution. Conventional MRI detects only the signal from the Hydrogen in liquid water; MRI of solids is so much more difficult that it is rarely attempted. To perform high-resolution MR imaging of solids, this project uses the innovation of quadratic echo line-narrowing, which was recently discovered as a direct result of the NSF's investment in basic, curiosity-driven research. Potential solid targets include porous rocks, composite materials, ""through-silicon vias"" in 3D integrated circuits, bone and soft tissues. Cutting-edge science with a broad range of potential applications enables excellent education and training of students from the early undergraduate level through the Ph.D., along with K-12 outreach efforts. While this project's plan of work is aimed at making fundamental scientific contributions, the work should find applications in other areas of science and technology, and there are potential societal benefits as well. For example, applying an entirely new experimental tool to problems in granular physics, such as the properties of grain in silos, can advance theory and experiment in a field that is very important to industry.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The small difference between hard pi-pulses and their delta-function approximation can be used to generate new classes of spin echoes which have promising applications in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or microscopy of solids, and related spectroscopies. For example, using the quadratic echo line-narrowing pulse sequence, a novel tool for the control of spin coherence, this project is pursuing a new approach to carrying out MRI of solids with high spatial resolution. This project has a strong focus on the education and training of students from the early undergraduate level through the Ph.D., along with K-12 outreach efforts. While the plan of work is aimed at making fundamental scientific contributions, there are potential societal benefits as well. First, advancing new forms of spin coherence control, applicable to a wide variety of spin (pseudospin, or qubit) Hamiltonians, is broadly useful in many areas of spectroscopy. As part of this effort, we are working to extend the reach of quadratic echoes to an even wider range of nuclei (e.g., Carbon-13, Silicon-29) and experimental systems. Second, finding ways to squeeze more information from less data, in an effort to accelerate the imaging of solids, has immediate benefits to the kind of NMR that is used for structure determination in biology and chemistry (including drug discovery). This project's efforts to reconstruct high-quality MR images (or NMR spectra) from non-uniformly sampled data build upon Veit Elser's iterated maps approach, which is a form of compressed sensing well-suited for this application. Third, applying an entirely new experimental tool to problems in granular physics will advance theory and experiment in a field that is very important to industry. Historically, improvements in our ability to 'see' inside opaque solids have had broader impacts."
0.871324,"Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics) is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments that acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. These experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics: What are the underlying constituents of matter? And how do they interact? With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics is complete. It provides an excellent description of known particles and forces. However, the most interesting questions remain open: What is the dark matter which pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the mechanism stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum corrections? The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale data samples to provide answers. Analyzing this data will require new and better tools. <br/><br/>First, the project will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas.

It will establish infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the experimental community. DIANA?s products will sit in the ROOT framework, already used by the HEP community of more than 10000 particle and nuclear physicists. By improving interoperability with the larger scientific software ecosystem, DIANA will incorporate best practices and algorithms from other disciplines into HEP. Similarly, the project will make its computing insights, tools, and novel ideas related to collaborative analysis, standards for data preservation, and best practices for treating software as a research product available to the larger scientific community.

The instrument will be used in undergraduate research projects in areas of organic, inorganic and environmental chemistry. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.

0.416641,"Through this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - A Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Kenneth R. Leopold will elucidate fundamental aspects of microsolvation, hydrogen bonding, and proton transfer through microwave spectroscopy of small gas phase clusters. Toward this goal, a new chirped-pulse microwave spectrometer will be constructed. The new instrument will run in tandem with the existing cavity-type Fourier transform microwave spectrometer at the Minnesota laboratory and will reduce data acquisition time by two to three orders of magnitude. Accurate moments of inertia and nuclear hyperfine constants will be obtained from spectra and used to determine the structures of the complexes studied as well as the nature of the electron distributions within the monomer units. The fundamental science will be explored, in many cases, using molecules that are active in the Earth's atmosphere, producing a blend of basic and applied science. The ability to collect data rapidly will permit the sharing of resources with faculty and undergraduates at primarily undergraduate institutions, thus expanding both the scientific and educational impact of the new spectrometer. <br/><br/>Molecules have distinct preferences for how they interact when they approach each other, and these preferences have important effects on the macroscopic world as we know it. This research involves detailed studies aimed at understanding how these intermolecular interactions in the microscopic world relate to the properties of bulk matter. By studying how molecules absorb microwaves, the distances between atoms and the angles between bonds can be determined. Then, by forming small clusters (small groups of molecules), it is possible to learn about the geometric features of intermolecular interactions and how these features evolve as the molecules assemble. Such information constitutes foundational knowledge for a wide variety of disciplines. For example, small molecular clusters can play several roles in the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere, as they are involved in processes leading to atmospheric acids and aerosols. Moreover, small molecular clusters offer microscopic insight into the molecules dissolve in solutions, whose properties can determine the efficacy of synthetic and industrial processes. Intermolecular interactions also play an important role in biology through their influence on the shapes (conformations) of molecules important in life processes. Thus, this work will have broad impact in areas ranging from environmental chemistry, to industrial chemistry, to molecular biology. The participation of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral fellows adds a significant educational component to the broader impact of this work."
0.106347,"1510764(Vidic)/1509086(Flora)<br/><br/>Recent breakthroughs in directional well drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and reservoir stimulation have enabled economical production of oil and natural gas from low-permeability shale formations. Combined with favorable oil and gas prices, these technological developments encouraged a vigorous pursuit of energy independence by the US. It is expected that the extraction of natural gas will increase by more than 100% in the next 15 years. One of the key environmental concerns is the accumulation of naturally occurring radioactive material during wastewater reuse and the lack of ultimate solutions that would address this problem once the wastewater reuse is no longer feasible. This study is designed to provide comprehensive understanding of the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material brought to the surface from deep geologic formations during storage and recycling of produced water.<br/><br/>This study focuses on fundamental experimental and modeling research necessary to advance understanding of the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material in deep geologic formations while maintaining its relevance to transformative engineering solutions in the control of naturally occurring radioactive material for successful water management strategy in oil and gas industry. Fundamental understanding of rock-water interaction that will be developed in this study will facilitate development of technical solutions to enable control of naturally occurring radioactive material in produced water. The combined experimental and modeling expertise of this research group will ensure deep understanding of key factors governing the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material in water treatment processes that use chemical precipitation and will have far-reaching consequences for oil and gas industry by facilitating science- based solutions to address key environmental concerns that have led to significant public opposition in many parts of the world. The proposed study will attain fundamental scientific understanding of the phenomena that are relevant to other industries besides oil and gas (e.g., mining, nuclear) and will ensure more sustainable water management strategies by those industries. Water management solutions developed in this study will also provide impetus for the development of new solutions in other industries that are facing challenges with the control of radioactive elements. Educational impact will be accomplished through training students in rich, multidisciplinary environment to develop problem-solving skills that are transferable to any field. This project will be showcased at regional high schools though exciting and interactive hand-on experience that sparks interest in advancements in S.T.E.M. disciplines. Findings of this study have implications for world energy supply, while better understanding of fundamental processes will spur development of new technologies for water treatment."
0.3,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Carleton DeTar of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Utah. These activities are carried out in collaboration with scientists at several US universities and government laboratories. The research addresses fundamental questions in high energy and nuclear physics, and is directly related to major experimental programs in these fields. The principal goal of this research is to discover evidence for new fundamental physical processes and particles. This is done by comparing precise predictions of the presently agreed upon models with results of precise experiments. Secondary projects include a study of exotic states consisting of heavy quarks and a study of the properties of matter at extreme temperatures, such as may have occurred in the very early universe. The methods the PI will develop and the calculational products and software are used widely around the world for related studies. Algorithmic ideas developed in this project will almost certainly have applications in other computational fields. The supported activity promotes the development of young scientists.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, Professor DeTar is carrying out a broad research program in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of interacting quarks and gluons, in which he has been engaged for a number of years. He does this using numerical calculations on high performance computers. These numerical calculations are done on a grid of space-time points (lattice). During the last several years he has generated a library of gluon configuration ensembles with up, down, strange and charm quarks, using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action. They can be thought of as ""snapshots"" of the QCD vacuum. They are the basis for a wide variety of calculations of physical interest. These ensembles have significantly smaller lattice artifacts than those previously generated with the improved staggered (asqtad) action. Moreover, the PI has reached an important milestone by, for the first time, generating configurations in which the four lightest quarks are all included with masses at or very close to their physical values. For these reasons the HISQ ensembles are enabling major improvements in the calculation of a variety of physical quantities of importance in high energy physics. Under this project the PI will use them to extend studies of the leptonic decay constants of the pi, K, D, Ds, B and Bs mesons, the semileptonic form factors of D and B mesons, and the mixing of neutral B and Bs mesons with their antiparticles. These calculations will enable him to significantly improve the precision of the determinations of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements V_us, V_ub, V_cd, V_cs, and V_cb, as well as the masses of the up, down, strange, charm and bottom quarks. The calculations of the CKM matrix elements will enable more stringent tests of current theories of the fundamental interactions of physics, while the determination of related hadronic weak interaction matrix elements can shed light on theories that have been proposed to study physics that goes beyond our current theories. In addition, the PI will extend the study of QCD at high temperatures with the HISQ action that for the first time includes the effects of charm sea quarks. Finally, he will continue the effort to improve the precision of the determination of lattice spacings through use of the gradient flow."
0.2,"NON-TECHNICAL PART: This REU Site (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) will bring ten undergraduates to the University of Florida for each summer 2015-2017 to conduct research under the guidance of a faculty mentor and other research group members. At least half of the students will come from institutions with limited research opportunities, and students from underrepresented groups will be actively recruited to the program. Students will also participate in professional development activities such as seminars on current areas of research and applying to graduate school, workshops on public speaking and scientific writing, and laboratory tours. Participants will be housed in shared apartments adjacent to campus to create a cohort experience. For many students in the program this will be their first exposure to research. The program is designed to encourage them to continue on to careers in science, technology, and engineering. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL PART: The research projects cover a broad cross-section of condensed matter and materials physics such as growth of new materials in the search for new superconductors, fabrication of transistors which utilize carbon nanotube films for one electrode, use of optical pumping to enhance nuclear magnetic resonance in semiconductors, simulation of realistic materials using molecular dynamics or density functional theory, and simulation of model systems such as those that undergo quantum phase transitions. The REU students will have access to many shared facilities such as the University of Florida Nanoscale Research Facility and High Performance Computing Center, and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in both Gainesville and Tallahassee. Many of the REU participants are expected to present their results at scientific meetings and to be coauthors on papers."
0.019641,"The Neotropics is one of the most biodiverse regions of the world. However, understanding the historical processes underlying this diversity is a challenging task due in part to the complex geographic and climatological history of this region. For mammals, this task is further hindered by our lack of fundamental knowledge about biodiversity, such as the number of species occurring in this area, their distribution, and how they are related to each other. This is particularly true for a group of small opossums (Thylamyini), which are broadly distributed throughout the Neotropics but are often morphologically indistinguishable from each other. There are 37 currently recognized species of Thylamyini, but preliminary analyses suggest that species diversity may be nearly double that.<br/> This project aims to discover the true diversity of this ecologically important group of mammals using multiple nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences as well as morphology. This revised view of mammalian diversity will have profound implications for our understanding of diversification in the Neotropics and will provide the basis for much needed conservation strategies in this time of global extinction. In addition, the proposed outreach and educational activities will continue to strengthen developing collaborations between US and Colombian institutions of higher education."
0.634599,"This project is focused on the study of the formation and growth of new particles in the atmosphere. It involves an international collaboration that enables U.S. scientists to work at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, at the CLOUD (COsmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber there.

0.950564,"Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics) is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments that acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. These experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics: What are the underlying constituents of matter? And how do they interact? With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics is complete. It provides an excellent description of known particles and forces. However, the most interesting questions remain open: What is the dark matter which pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the mechanism stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum corrections? The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale data samples to provide answers. Analyzing this data will require new and better tools. <br/><br/>First, the project will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas. It will develop software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core hardware. It will establish infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the experimental community. DIANA?s products will sit in the ROOT framework, already used by the HEP community of more than 10000 particle and nuclear physicists. By improving interoperability with the larger scientific software ecosystem, DIANA will incorporate best practices and algorithms from other disciplines into HEP. Similarly, the project will make its computing insights, tools, and novel ideas related to collaborative analysis, standards for data preservation, and best practices for treating software as a research product available to the larger scientific community. Finally, to improve the quality of the next generation of software engineers in HEP, DIANA will host an annual workshop on analysis tools and establish a fellowship program."
0.606515,"Ryan Steele of the University of Utah is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop new approaches to the computational simulation of chemical processes. Such simulations currently exhibit the potential to unravel critical details of societally relevant chemistry challenges, including renewable energy. They also, however, are impeded by computational cost hurdles which limit the applicability of these methods. This research program seeks alternative approaches which dramatically extend the range of applicability of these methods and the development of new simulation methodology. Specifically, this work will address the motion of molecules and the manner in which this motion dictates chemical reactivity. The computational tools developed in this project will be made available to the broader research community. In concert with these developments, integrated education components of this program strive to improve the manner in which students and educators view chemistry -- both literally and conceptually -- by using newly developed simulation/visualization tools and pedagogy. These education aims will facilitate a change in pedagogy, as well as increase access for underserved students and their educators.<br/><br/><br/>The key proposed methodology -- and the unique aspect of the research in this funding period -- is a new algorithmic interface which marries ab initio electronic structure theory with sampling and on-the-fly dynamics. This work seeks to exploit the inherent spatial and temporal separability of the inner workings of electronic structure methods for new, dynamics-specific simulations of large, reactive chemical systems. Application to water oxidation complexes, where unique electronic structure and nuclear motion abound, will be enabled by this new methodology."
0.625,"Francesco Paesani of the University of California San Diego is supported by a CAREER award from the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division and the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure to develop new theoretical and computational approaches for molecular-level computer simulations. Such simulations have become a powerful tool in chemistry, often providing fundamental insights into complex phenomena which are otherwise difficult to obtain. However, achieving the necessary accuracy for realistic and predictive simulations remains challenging. Paesani and his research group are meeting this challenge by combining a variety of approaches to generate very accurate models of many systems including ions in solution. The new methodology enables computer simulations of aqueous systems with unprecedented accuracy, providing information on fundamental molecular processes from ion hydration in bulk and at interfaces to proton transfer and transport in solution. The new methodology will be available to the community through its implementation in the open and free OpenMM software toolkit for molecular simulations. This ""reference implementation"" aims to provide the community with a completely open computational tool which may be used by other researchers interested in implementing it in their own simulation codes. In addition, this initial implementation is a starting point for future developments of unique software elements specifically designed for high-performance computing which will enable many-body simulations with unprecedented accuracy on both multicore CPU and GPU architectures.<br/><br/>In parallel with the proposed research activities, Paesani has established an innovative education and outreach plan focusing on the development of an entry level course that introduces undergraduate students in their freshman and sophomore years to the use of computational methods in chemistry, as well as on mentoring activities specifically designed to promote study in the STEM disciplines among students from underprivileged and traditionally underrepresented groups through the development of a summer exchange program at UC-San Diego.<br/><br/><br/>Both the realism and the predicting power of a computer simulation strongly depend on the accuracy with which the molecular interactions and the overall system dynamics are described. Although ab initio methods can, in principle, enable the characterization of physicochemical processes without resorting to ad hoc simplifications, the associated computational cost effectively prevents the use of these methods to model realistic condensed-phase systems. Furthermore, a rigorous description of the actual molecular dynamics often requires a quantum-mechanical treatment of the nuclear motion, which further increases the computational cost associated with ab initio computer simulations. The methods developed by Paesani and coworkers seeks to overcome these limitations by combining machine-learning many-body potential energy surfaces derived entirely from highly-correlated electronic structure data with novel quantum-dynamical approaches based on path-integral molecular dynamics and centroid molecular dynamics. The efficient integration of these components pushes the boundaries of current molecular dynamics techniques and provides new opportunities for realistic simulations of condensed-phase systems in direct connection with corresponding spectroscopic measurements. Although much broader in scope, the initial application of the methodology is to modeling physicochemical processes in solution, with a specific focus on ion hydration, linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy, and proton transfer/transport. The new methodology will be made available to the community through its implementation in the C++ ""reference platform"" of the open and free OpenMM software toolkit for molecular simulations. Specifically, implementation will consist of an independent plug-in to provide the community with a completely open implementation of these many-body potentials. This plug-in will include a complete suite of unit tests that cover all energy and force components as well as the inner functions of our many-body potentials. A number of test cases will also be made available for comparing output energies and forces obtained with OpenMM with the reference values calculated with the PI's in house implementation. To facilitate the use of the new many-body potentials, the plug-in will also offer a Python wrapper that will simplify both setting up and running many-body molecular simulations to the point where all simulation parameters will be entirely defined in an XML file. This plug-in will thus provide other researchers with a comprehensive implementation of our many-body potentials for aqueous simulations, which can be used as a reference for the implementation in other software. In addition, this reference implementation will serve as a starting point for future developments of unique software elements for the OpenMM toolkit, specifically designed for high-performance computing on both multicore CPU and GPU architectures. The development and application of the new simulation methodology will involve the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows, who will acquire a solid foundation in theoretical, physical, and computational chemistry. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed project will provide an opportunity for students and postdocs to establish bridges and inter-connections between the fundamental laws of physical chemistry at a molecular level and the properties of condensed-phase systems. The possibility to work at the interface of different disciplines will prepare both students and postdocs for a wide range of scientific careers."
0.19305,"Redefining Surface Area: Understanding Reactive Interfaces in Heterogeneous Porous Media<br/><br/>Biogeochemical reaction rates in the natural subsurface are typically controlled by those at the ""hot"" reactive interfaces where fluids and solids of different properties and conditions meet. These interfaces are often restricted to relatively small, sharp zones with rates orders of magnitude higher than those at the rest of the domain. The research outcomes from this project will be important for a broad spectrum of applications at the nexus of energy, water, and environment. In particular, they will advance understanding and predicting of physical, chemical, and biological processes important for shale gas development, acid mine drainage, nuclear waste disposal, geological CO2 sequestration, geothermal energy, and contaminant transport. Fundamental understanding of the earth systems, including the Critical Zone where humans live, is also essential for soil fertility and productivity, water sustainability, and energy security, all of which are subject to climate change and intense human activities in the Anthropocene.<br/><br/>In this study the investigator hypothesizes that the emergence and nature of reactive interfaces are dictated by spatial heterogeneities, the spatial variations in porous medium properties and conditions. These reactive interfaces ultimately govern large scale processes and system functioning. Whereas hydrologists have documented significant impacts of physical heterogeneities on fluid flow and solute transport in the past decades, present understanding on the role of physical and geochemical heterogeneities in determining (bio)geochemical processes has not kept pace. The investigator proposes to understand fundamental principles that govern the occurrence and functioning of reactive interfaces. The ultimate goal is to develop conceptual and predictive framework for geochemical processes in natural, heterogeneous subsurface. The proposed work will integrate two-dimensional flow-through experiments and multi-scale reactive transport modeling. The 2D flow cells will be packed using calcite, chlorite, and quartz-minerals that differ drastically in reactivity and are ubiquitous in natural systems. Understanding reactive interfaces will enable a significant step toward unifying observations across scales. The goal of the education and outreach plan is to empower the science community and general public with tools and education in ways that transcend limits of time, space, and individual disciplines. The investigator proposes to (1) develop an online module with a ""heterogeneity"" focus as part of a much-needed online reactive transport modeling (RTM) course for delivery through Penn State's World Campus; (2) develop a repository website that organizes the online teaching materials for free access to the public; (3) promote diversity and environmental awareness by offering underrepresented high school students a summer research opportunity on ""Water flow through rocks"". The plan will equip the community with knowledge and predictive tools for environmental stewardship, water management, as well as protection and sustainable use of natural resources."

The smaller the pixels (i.e., the finer the approximation), the smoother a curve looks. Add three colors and suddenly we can approximate a rainbow. In a sense, science is all about refining and improving approximations to reality. Take Newtonian physics, for example. It works great at medium scales, but breaks down when things are too big or too small. Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics work much better at those scales. And these theories require sophisticated mathematics. This focused research group project addresses several outstanding questions in operator algebras and their analogies in other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Operator algebras arose as a framework for quantum mechanics. Over the years many classical theories were extended to this noncommutative context: geometry, topology, probability and more. The PIs will spearhead an international effort to capitalize on recent connections between operator algebras and other areas such as dynamics, measure theory, coarse geometry and K-theory. Specifically, the PIs shall push analogies between nuclear dimension and asymptotic dimension, two notions defined via approximation and encompassing a huge swath of examples, to address K-theoretic questions such as the Universal Coefficient Theorem and the Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones conjectures."
0.020344,"Parasitism is a unique life history strategy that has evolved independently dozens of times in plants, animals, and other organisms. Due to its high biodiversity and a good understanding of its mode of parasitism, the non-photosynthetic parasitic plant genus Orobanche provides a remarkable opportunity for understanding the unique macro- and microevolutionary consequences of parasitism in a phylogenetic framework. Recent work has identified both evolutionary and genetic consequences, including numerous host specific lineages as well as host-to-parasite horizontal gene transfer. This research will use genomic-scale sequencing of new-world Orobanche and field studies across North America to develop the following: (1) a fine-scale understanding of tempo and mode of genome evolution in parasitic plants, (2) a better understanding of host-breadth, and (3) abiotic and biotic habitat characteristics, with a taxonomic revision to follow. In addition to advancing the fields of evolutionary biology and ecology, an improved understanding of host specificity and parasite genomics may be of use in combating several species of Orobanche that cause severe agricultural damage to tomato, sunflower, and other crops in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. One graduate and several undergraduate students will receive training in laboratory and museum research techniques, and will have the opportunity to present the results at regional and national meetings.<br/><br/>Specifically, we will use a genome skimming approach, coupled with field studies across North America to study (1) fine-scale tempo and mode of plastid and mitochondrial evolution in new-world Orobanche, (2) host-breadth of numerous lineages, (3) abiotic and biotic habitat characteristics to better understand distributions, and (4) diagnosable features of lineages, leading directly to taxonomic revision.

Aggregation of lead carboxylates in oil paintings is known to lead to the formation of protrusions and paint loss in most cases, and to increased transparency of the paint films in others, resulting in damage to the integrity of the artworks. While widely observed, the phenomenon is not well understood. The collaborating investigators, their students and postdoctoral trainees will determine the structure, molecular dynamics, and phase behavior of lead carboxylates using solid state 13C,207Pb magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 1H-207Pb and 13C-207Pb dipolar re-coupling experiments, and deuterium NMR along with other analytical tools. They will elucidate the mechanism of aggregate formation/migration and based on the results, recommend procedures to arrest the deterioration process of oil paintings.<br/><br/>The solid state NMR experiments have the potential to transform the field of cultural heritage science since they will provide molecular information, which is not currently available to the cultural heritage science community. The experiments are a gateway to the application of emerging minimally invasive NMR methods like micro-MAS NMR to study cultural heritage objects. Advancing the state of the art for 207Pb solid-state NMR also has broader implications for understanding the structure of lead-containing electronic and optoelectronic materials, high-Tc superconducting materials, and the speciation and reaction of lead in environmentally contaminated materials.

0.752355,"An award is made to UCLA to develop a high throughput Mechanotyping Platform (MTP). Mechanical properties of cells and nuclei are implicated in a wide range of biological contexts: they are central for determining how physical forces alter gene expression, and more broadly they can signal a transformation in a cell?s physiological state, such as in malignant transformation. However, to advance our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell/nuclear mechanical properties requires probing the mechanical properties of cells and nuclei across genetic and physical phase space; this demands measurements of a large number of samples and single cells which cannot be achieved on a feasible timescale using existing methods. MTP offers dramatic improvements over current techniques in time, cost, and user-accessibility, and is comprised of two independent technologies: (1) High Throughput Mechanical Screening (HTMS) instrumentation simultaneously probes the deformability of hundreds of individual samples by subjecting them to external stresses, forcing them to deform through micron-scale pores, and determining the number of passaged cells; this provides a physiologically relevant assay to detect relative mechanical changes that have direct implications for the circulation and perfusion of cells through vasculature and tissues. (2) A Mechanical Probing System (MaPS) measures elastic moduli directly from single cells and nuclei at rates of 100 per second by flowing cells through a microfluidic channel, poking the cell with a force probe embedded in the channel, and determining the resultant deformation; this will enable reproducible measurements of the mechanical properties of single cells at unprecedented speeds. The proposed research will establish a framework for mechanotyping that will be accessible to biological researchers in fields ranging from stem cells to cancer biology. Probing the mechanical signatures of cells can also provide an alternative approach to classify and treat a wide range of diseases. In addition, this research will provide critical insight into the molecular origins of mechanical phenotype, heterogeneity within a population of single cells, and more broadly, will transform the search for crucial information in biological research by exploiting the inherent texture or mechanotype of individual cells.<br/><br/>The educational objective of this project is to engage undergraduate and high school students, as well as general audiences, in science using food and cooking as pedagogical tools.

3.644169,"There is mounting evidence that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a subnuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale at which Inflation occurred. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor-to-scalar modes, r = T/S. Many theoretically favored models of Inflation produce this ratio between 0.01 and 0.1, corresponding to average amplitude from 30 to 100 nanoKelvins for the resulting CMB B-mode polarization patterns where they peak on scales of degrees. With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and ultimately detecting the CGB polarization signature, which is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. In 2005, the Community Task Force on CMB Research identified a target sensitivity of that ratio equaling to 0.02 as an immediate goal to detect the Inflationary gravitational waves imprint in the CMB polarization that pertain to the standard cosmological model. The newly installed 'Small Polarimeter Upgrades for DASI' (SPUD) reconfigured a five- receivers telescope to the ""South Pole Inflationary Cosmology Experiment"" (SPICE) that will: (a) Complete the CGB search in CMB B-mode polarization at 150 GHz, reaching depths which based on current sensitivity performance, that will detect the Inflationary CGB for r > 0.02; (b) Prove that this signal is cosmic in origin while separately measuring the Galactic foreground contamination at its minimum; (c) Detect gravitational lensing of CMB polarization on scales of ~1 degree, probing the CGB to the lensing confusion limit for degree-scale observations (r < 0.01) if the energy scale of Inflation is low; and (d) Surpass the instrumental sensitivity goals set forth for 2013 by the 2005 CMB Task Force recommendations. Detection of the CGB waves would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang theory. Indeed, its impact may be even broader as nuclear physics had matured enough prior to the establishment of the ""hot"" Big Bang model, while Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics: the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics, string theory, and the highest accessible energies. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science and train students."
0.12,"Reactive processes such as forest fires, nuclear reactions in stars, or burning in internal combustion engines are ubiquitous in nature, science, and engineering. Mixing due to motion of a liquid or gaseous medium in which reactive processes occur is frequently an important component in their dynamics, and is also relevant to other processes, such as reliable manufacturing of glasses and alloys. This motion may be subject to fluid turbulence, the effects of which are of paramount importance in many areas of physics and engineering. The central aim of this project is a better understanding of the long term behavior of these physical processes through the analytical study of their mathematical models, which are expressed in the form of partial differential equations. The main questions addressed will be the question of dependence of the speed of spreading of reactive processes on the properties and structure of combustive media in which they occur; the question of how an underlying mixing process can enhance this speed and which types of mixing are most efficient at achieving this; and the question of spontaneous development of turbulence and unexpected singular behaviors in the motion of fluids. The goal is to obtain mathematically rigorous results which can also shed further light on the dynamical behavior of the actual physical processes being modeled. <br/><br/>This research project studies mathematical models of several important physical processes, which include reactive processes, fluid dynamics, and mixing. The models are given by linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations, transport equations, and equations of fluid dynamics. The main interest is in the long term dynamics of their solutions as well as in the formation of singularities. The goal of the reaction-diffusion portion of the project is the understanding and description of long term dynamics of reactive processes spreading through inhomogeneous media in one and several dimensions, including existence of traveling fronts, asymptotic convergence of general solutions to them, and homogenization of solutions in random media. The goal of the mixing portion of the project is the study of mixing efficiency of flows and the search for those which are best at mixing substances advected by them. The goal of the fluid dynamics portion of the project is the study of turbulence, particularly creation of small scales and finite time singularity formation in models of fluid and atmospheric motion in two dimensions. Another goal of the research is the study of active combustion, where all three of these processes come together due to a direct feedback of the reaction on fluid motion via the buoyancy force. Models incorporating such feedback involve reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid dynamics equations, and the focus will be on existence and stability of traveling fronts and on gravity-induced mixing. To address these questions, the research will make use of techniques recently developed by the investigator and collaborators, as well as the development of new methods capable of further advancing understanding of the dynamical behavior of reactive processes."
0.50395,"Mutation induces genetic variation. Genetic variation, in turn, fuels evolutionary change. Experimental investigations into the rate and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations are central to the study of evolution and biology. Mutation accumulation (MA) experiments have been instrumental in measuring the rate of origin of deleterious mutations. However, the vast majority of MA studies to date are compromised by two major limitations: (i) the use of phenotypic data to indirectly estimate key mutational parameters, and (ii) the use of experimental lines maintained at a single, minimum effective population size. Although population-genetics theory predicts a wide range of fitness consequences for all classes of spontaneous mutations, their distribution of fitness effects remains obscure. Furthermore, the loss or fixation of mutations and their consequences for population fitness additionally depend upon their individual effect and the efficacy of natural selection, the latter being influenced by the population size. Spontaneous MA lines of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were evolved in parallel over 400 generations at three varying effective population sizes to manipulate the efficacy of natural selection in different genomic backgrounds. This represents the most ambitious experiment of its kind within any species. The combination of long-term spontaneous MA lines under varying intensities of selection and use of powerful high-throughput genomic techniques will enable unprecedented insights into (i) the rates of origin of diverse mutations, (ii) their differential accumulation under varying regimes of natural selection, and (iii) a framework to assess the interaction between mutation and selection at the molecular level on a genome-wide scale. The aims are to identify all acquired mutations at the mitochondrial and nuclear level, investigate their differential rates of accumulation under varying population sizes and infer their distribution of fitness effects. Phenotypic fitness-assays will quantify the rate of fitness decay at different population sizes and determine the extent to which larger populations are buffered from mutational degradation. By providing a unified account of the consequences of spontaneous mutations at the genetic and phenotypic levels, this research will yield significant insights into the evolutionary process for several different topics, including the genetic basis of variation, the evolutionary dynamics of mutations under the forces of natural selection and genetic drift, and their range of fitness effects. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The experimental lines provide an unprecedented resource to study biological evolution at multiple scales, from phenotype to protein function. The experimental MA lines created as part of this research and the deposition of genome sequences in public databases represent an enormous community resource to be shared with colleagues in the scientific community. In addition to the training projects listed with individual aims, this project will have broad impacts in two areas: academic training/mentorship and public outreach in an environment with a large fraction of underrepresented minorities. Data generated by the research will be (i) disseminated to high school students and the general public via seminars and interactive panel discussions to communicate its evolutionary implications and promote scientific literacy, and (ii) employed in the creation of data sets and mini tutorials for high school students to demystify molecular evolution and introduce them to basic evolutionary computational methods for analyses of genomic sequences. The University of New Mexico is the only research-intensive University that is also Hispanic serving, with two extensive underrepresented student populations comprising Hispanics and Native Americans. This provides a unique opportunity to mentor undergraduate minority students, graduate students and postdocs, and instill in them an appreciation for interdisciplinary research in population-genomics and bioinformatics. Research stemming from this project is expected to greatly enhance our fundamental understanding of the evolutionary process and enable the quantification of several key rate parameters in biology, with implications for all spheres of biology including an understanding of the genetic and phenotypic consequences of maintaining populations at small sizes."
0.860235,"Intellectual Merit: The Hedgehog pathway is an ancient cell-cell signaling pathway by which cells communicate their position and developmental state to one another. Hedgehog signaling acts though the Gli family of transcription factors, which bind to regulatory DNA sequences called enhancers to activate or repress the expression of specific target genes. In order to understand the cell's responses to Hedgehog signaling, it is important to identify direct Gli target genes in the genome, and to understand how their expression is controlled by signaling. By integrating quantitative measurements of gene expression in the fruit fly Drosophila with computational modeling of transcriptional responses, this project will identify important mechanisms of transcriptional control by Hedgehog signaling, and will have immediate applications for strategies to identify new pathway targets. Furthermore, these principles may apply to other major signaling pathways, such as the Notch, Wnt, and nuclear receptor pathways, which, like Hedgehog, are found in animals from insects to humans. The interdisciplinary objectives of the project are to: (1) Functionally define the properties of Gli binding sites that control transcriptional responses to Hedgehog signaling; and (2) Directly integrate computational and experimental approaches to identify key regulatory mechanisms under the control of Hedgehog signaling.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project will positively impact science education, scientific training/mentorship, and diversity in the sciences, in several respects. First, the experiments and computational work will form the basis for training postdoctoral and graduate trainees, including those from underrepresented minority communities. Second, the project includes objectives that will be accomplished by undergraduate researchers and high-school volunteers, including those from underrepresented groups, and incorporates scientific and professional training for these early-stage students. Third, results from the project will be directly incorporated into new teaching tools in an innovative developmental biology course, aimed at early-stage graduate students and advanced undergraduates."

0.251704,"Loeselia is an obscure and little studied lineage in the flowering plant family Polemoniaceae (phlox family), which includes two genera: Loeselia L. and Dayia J.M. Porter. Despite the lack of detailed knowledge about the lineage, Loeselia has played a pivotal role in hypotheses concerning the origin of temperate members of Polemoniaceae from tropical ancestors. This research program will provide a better understanding of Loeselia (with 22 or more species). Preliminary studies of comparative DNA sequences provide evidence that Loeselia is composed of two groups of species based on ancestry, corresponding to Loeselia L. and Dayia J.M. Porter. Exhaustive taxon sampling within Loeselia and dense sampling of related groups will be used to develop an understanding of genealogical relationships (phylogeny) within and among species, using chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences, morphological, and anatomical data.<br/><br/>Evidence generated through this research will lead to a new classification system and the first comprehensive monographs of Loeselia, including keys, descriptions, illustrations, distribution maps, and on-line resources. The studies of character evolution, using the same data, will provide a model for analyses of variation in reproductive traits such as self-incompatibility and floral symmetry, which is thought to be an important generator of flowering plant diversity."

1.40077,"A broad range of astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates that 80% of the matter in the universe is in a new form which does not emit or absorb light, and has not yet been encountered in the laboratory. Many physics models suggest that the dark matter may be composed of one or more previously unobserved Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs. The astrophysical detection of such a particle through its interactions in a terrestrial particle detector would have a profound impact on cosmology and fundamental interactions, while also giving rise to a new type of observational astrophysics. This work supports key research and development and design efforts toward construction of a 7-ton liquid Xenon dark matter detector, known as 'LZ', to be installed at the 4850 level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. This detector will use established liquid Xenon Time Projection Chamber technology with read out of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-d position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid Xenon, removal of surface artifacts and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The experiment will take advantage of existing infrastructure and detector components from the LUX experiment, which is currently being deployed into the mine, allowing a rapid turn-around at the conclusion of that experiment's life. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>By exploiting the natural curiosity of the public in dark matter as well as the connection and familiarity with gravity, this project will provide a rich environment in which to develop a range of activities from tours and displays to partnerships with local schools and individuals, aimed at fostering an interest in science and science careers. Through both LUX and LZ programs, the collaboration will continue to play a key role in the efforts at Sanford in education and public outreach programs. Dark matter science also demands the development of new technologies that are ultra-sensitive to radiation and new methods for achieving ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. There is direct overlap with the methods used in a wide range of nuclear security and medical imaging contexts. The instrument that will be developed will also provide direct educational and training benefits at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, and will promote basic science research by providing access to non-Ph.D. granting institutions, particularly those in geographical proximity to Lead, SD."
0.149999,"The central questions in this project concern how events are distributed in diverse systems, such as energy levels of heavy nuclei, leading digits in sets of data, and the prime numbers among the integers. Similar to the central limit theorem in probability and statistics, there seem to be universal spacing laws that govern these and other phenomena; thus studies in one of these topics can frequently provide useful insights in the others. Understanding these systems requires the development of tools and techniques in complex analysis, Fourier analysis, number theory, and probability. Some of the topics have immediate practical applications; for example, the Internal Revenue Service uses Benford's law to locate corporate tax fraud. Many of questions under study in this project have components that are amenable to numerical experimentation; these and tractable special cases will be investigated with undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research assistants. The investigator will also continue work in mathematics education. In addition to providing professional development opportunities to students (such as arranging for them to referee for journals, contribute to Mathematical Reviews, write expository articles for journals, and co-organize special sessions at professional society meetings), the investigator will involve students in expanding the Math Riddles web page (mathriddles.williams.edu), a site that is used in junior high and high schools around the world to excite students about mathematics.<br/><br/>This research project studies a variety of problems on L-functions, additive number theory, and Benford's law. A central theme is an analysis of gaps between events. The main topic concerns zeros of L-functions; connections have been observed between these and high energy nuclear physics and random matrix theory (RMT). Among the questions under study are: n-level densities (main and lower order terms) for zeros of L-functions, alternatives to the Katz-Sarnak determinantal expansions that are more amenable for comparisons between number theory and RMT, determining the optimal test functions to bound excess rank, biases in second moments of Fourier coefficients of L-functions, modeling zeros near the central point through excised RMT ensembles, large gaps between zeros of L-functions, the density of states and behavior of the eigenvalues of structured random matrix ensembles, generalized Zeckendorf decompositions and the gaps between summands, generalized sum and difference sets, Ramsey theory for sets avoiding 3-term geometric progressions in finite fields and non-commutative settings, and Benford's law in fragmentation problems and fraud detection."
0.780736,"Intellectual Merit: A complex network of regulatory proteins functions in eukaryotic cells to ensure that normal RNAs accumulate at the appropriate levels and that aberrant or potentially harmful RNAs are not expressed. The deleterious effects of transposable DNA elements are kept in check through surveillance pathways that function at various steps in RNA metabolism to block expression of transposon-encoded RNAs. Suppressor of sable protein [Su(s)] of Drosophila melanogaster is a component of a nuclear regulatory process that inhibits the accumulation of transposon-containing RNAs, such as those produced by alpha-beta retrotransposons located in the vicinity of heat-shock induced Hsp70 genes. The goal of this project is to learn more about this regulation and the specific role that Su(s) plays in inhibiting alpha-beta and other RNAs. Prior research indicates that Su(s) functions co-transcriptionally and interacts with Wdr82/Swd2, a multifunctional protein that has been shown by other labs to reside in at least two distinct complexes. One Wdr82/Swd2-containing complex regulates a particular chromatin modification (H3K4 methylation) in yeast and mammals. The other complex regulates 3' end processing and transcription termination at small nucleolar RNA genes in yeast. The main objective of the current research is to determine whether the activity of Su(s)/Wdr82 is related to one of the known Wdr82 functions or a different process. Thus, two hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, will be tested. The first hypothesis is that Su(s) and Wdr82 are recruited to the heat shock locus during heat stress and induce a chromatin modification that inhibits alpha-beta RNA accumulation. The second hypothesis is that Su(s), which is known to be an RNA-binding protein, binds directly to regulatory sequences in alpha-beta RNA and induces transcriptional stalling/termination or nascent RNA cleavage. Other experiments will map the Wdr82-interaction domain within Su(s). A multifaceted approach will be employed in this research, including chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, polytene chromosome immunofluorescence analysis, reporter gene expression studies, in vitro RNA cleavage assays, and protein-protein interaction analysis. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The results obtained from this research will advance the understanding of regulatory mechanisms that minimize the deleterious and mutagenic effects of transposons in multicellular organisms. In addition, this research is making a significant contribution to the development of human resources in science, as this ongoing project has supported and continues to support the training of numerous graduate and undergraduate students. Throughout her career the PI has been active in efforts at multiple levels--within her lab, the university, and beyond--to promote the participation and success of underrepresented groups in scientific research and academia. The PI also plays a leadership role in programs designed to enhance the academic success of undergraduate science majors and their participation in undergraduate research."

0.275,"In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Fereshteh Billiot of Texas A & M University Corpus Christi and Professor Kevin Morris of Carthage College and their undergraduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the effect of pH on chiral recognition by amino acid derived surfactants towards other species. The effect of pH on these surfactants will be studied with solution-phase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods, combined with other physical characterization methods. The surfactants show promise as pseudo-stationary phases in capillary electrophoresis separations of chiral mixtures. <br/><br/>Chiral molecules are molecules that have ""handed"" symmetry. They differ in structure from each other only in the sense that they are mirror images of each other. Since they have identical chemical structures, except for their handedness, mixtures of the chiral isomers are difficult to separate. Professors Billiot, Morris and their students are interested in designing new ways to separate chiral isomers. This work has important applications in purification and analysis of pharmaceuticals. The undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in carrying out the physic-chemical characterization of these interesting surfactant systems.

0.442,"Dmitry Matyushov of Arizona State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division, with co-funding from the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division, to develop a theoretical study of charge transport in mitochondrial energy complexes of biology. Protein complexes located in mitochondrial membranes provide all energy available to living cells. Disruptions of charge transport result in chronic diseases and are closely related to oxidative stress and aging. Matyushov and his research group are attempting to understand how chemical energy (obtained from food) is transformed into the energy stored for biological function. In this project, basic theoretical principles that have been identified on the scale of individual proteins are extended to the much larger scale of biology's energy chains. The main goal is better understand the factors influencing the energetic efficiency of living cells. A still unresolved challenge is how electrons are transported across the membrane without significant dissipation of energy into heat. The project links the structure and dynamics of the protein-membrane-water environment to energy-efficient electron transport. Graduates students and postdoctoral associates contribute to this research. As part of this project, the PI will organize summer computer schools for talented youth.<br/><br/><br/>The project aims at developing a predictive model that accounts for the effect of changing physical conditions and mutations in relevant proteins upon the rates of individual electron transfer steps and on overall cross-membrane electron transport. The proposed mechanism involves the conditions for breaking the equilibrium statistics of nuclear fluctuations affecting individual electron transfer steps. The breakdown of the system's ergodicity is possible due to strongly dispersive dynamics of the protein-water-membrane thermal bath spreading over many orders of magnitude in terms of relaxation times. No single theoretical technique is capable of covering this range of timescales. The problem is resolved by combining large-scale atomistic simulations of membrane-bound complexes with coarse-grain modeling of protein electro-elastic fluctuations to cover length- and timescales that are currently inaccessible by atomistic simulations. The mechanistic properties of protein electron transfer predicted by simulation are tested against the results of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. The project seeks to solves some of the most fundamental problems of interfacial statistics and dynamics on the nanometer length-scale andon the timescale of 1-100 nanoseconds: a) whether the Gibbs ensemble is an adequate tool for describing the reaction activation barriers, b) whether the Debye-Onsager picture of interfacial polarization is a good reference for developing predictive models of interfacial electrostatics, and c) whether an appropriate theoretical framework can be established that effectively describes energy dissipation and energy flow in biology."
0.24,"With this EAGER award, the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Chemistry Division is supporting Professor Nandini Ananth at Cornell University to develop models that describe processes where quantum mechanics is important for understanding the dynamics of complex chemical and physical systems. Characterizing chemical processes by understanding interactions at a sub-atomic level and by quantifying reaction rates is central to our understanding of chemistry, physics and biology. The introduction of classical transition state theory (TST) revolutionized our understanding of chemical reactions, because it allowed the efficient calculation of reaction rates for large systems in which it is not possible to do exact, detailed quantum mechanical calculations. Despite its many successes this theory cannot correctly describe processes where quantum mechanical behavior plays an important role. Recently, a quantum TST (QTST) was derived that incorporates quantum effects into formalism that resemble classical TST. In this work, Ananth and her coworkers are working to extend the QTST to a fundamentally important class of reactions for which it is currently inapplicable - electron and energy transfer processes. Developing such a theory could provide unprecedented insights into the mechanism of complex photo-induced chemical reactions.<br/><br/>There are two significant technical challenges that must be met in extending QTST to electron and energy transfer processes. First, the discrete electronic states of the quantum system must be replaced with continuous, classical variables that are necessary for the TST formulation. Second, nonadiabatic effects arising from coupling between electronic state transitions and nuclear motions must be accurately described. Ananth employs a mapping protocol based on Schwinger's angular momentum theory to map discrete states to Cartesian phase-space variables and uses the path-integral representation of quantum mechanics to incorporate nonadiabatic effects into an exact, classically isomorphic expression for a real-time, flux-side correlation function. The desired TST expression will be obtained as the short-time limit of the flux-side correlation function. This nonadiabatic QTST will be general, and can be used to provide a good estimate of reaction rates and insights into reaction pathways for any nonadiabatic, quantum mechanical chemical process. Further, the research team aims to establish a rigorous derivation of an approximate, path-integral based dynamics to provide quantitate reaction rates and detailed mechanistic information from real-time simulations of complex chemical systems."
0.146001,"Proposal #: 15-14626<br/>PI(s): Papanikolopoulos, Nikolaos; Lim, Kelvin O.<br/>Institution: University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (UMN)<br/>Title: RAPID: Remote Monitoring of Ebola Patients and Their Treating Physicians <br/>Project Proposed:<br/>This project, melding proven technologies, aims to assist in an immediate challenge now facing those engaged in direct patient care in the ongoing Ebola epidemic. Namely, employing interactive machine vision technologies and intelligently encoded protective gear to proactively assist health care providers (e.g., adhering to their required NIH/CDC (Center for Disease Control) Safety Procedures-the explicit movement sequences required for the proper donning of sterilized, protective coverings, and afterwards for the safe, step-wise and controlled removal and subsequent disposition of these now potentially lethal items). The crucial importance of this very high standard was underscored recently by the infection of two Dallas-area nurses where protocols were thought breached, and then by the CDC?s response, which next imposed an enhanced buddy system to better ensure future compliance. Notwithstanding, human monitors can sometimes lapse, especially when procedures become routine, as time pressures mount. Fortunately, incorporating respective lessons learned in the creation of an automated and interactive buddy is a readily achievable next step, given the advances in automated human activity and gesture recognition, with experience of the strict procedures evolved in conjunction with tele-operational assistance methods for domains such as surgery, and with modern graphical and human-friendly man-machine interfaces. Obviously, this new knowledge serves a useful purpose.<br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The relatively low cost in the longer term should be noted. Even portable extensions to any environment can be disproportionally costly or even catastrophic, particularly when participants fail to adhere to strict standards (usually tedious and unwelcome). In industry (e.g., clean rooms, nuclear sites, etc.), in medicine (e.g., operating theaters), in the military, and in some research areas, the cost of recording and registering sessions that compel the full compliance to required safety measures might easily be offset by better outcomes, fewer accidents and reduced insurance rates. This project contributes in building a coalition of large NSF awardees to jointly address public health problems of national and global significance using the state of the art in Computer Science. The UMN team will assist in the urgent data collection regarding the effectiveness of the protective gear used in Ebola-infected regions.<br/><br/>This research will enable the development of new quantitative crisis maps to approximate local regional rates of infectious Ebola virus spreading in near real time thereby enhancing the effective distribution of limited availability of recently developed vaccines to mitigate the spread of Ebola. Furthermore, it will provide a mechanism for validating and improving operational forecast models of the CDC by comparisons with regional social media observations. It may allow for disease surveillance and early detection among our third world countries. Moreover, this project is expected to be generalizable to other infectious virus conditions; the research enables exploiting social media health data from future hand held devices. Although enough speculation exists about the role of the gear, little data is available to push for changes in the protocols or the gear itself. Beyond the present issue of Ebola, the proposed methodology and the coalition building effort will support solutions in a wide range of public health issues."

The method is based on interpretation of depth profiles of cosmic-ray-produced nuclides (Be-10, Al-26 and Cl-36) beneath glaciated bedrock surfaces. Nuclide concentrations, ratios, and profile gradients are sensitive to the exposure and erosion history. We will invert these data to determine erosion over the past 0.5-1 million years. To verify the method we will measure profiles at up- and downflow ends of glacial landforms in eastern Maine, where existing theory predicts different erosion processes and strongly contrasting erosion rates. <br/><br/>This work will provide a quantitative method for the study of landscape evolution in glaciated terrain. This will allow geomorphologists to re-examine long-standing questions concerning the erosional effects of the Pleistocene ice sheets, formation rates of characteristic glacial landforms, and the origin of glacial valley profiles. Broader impacts of the work will include: (i) Graduate student training, (ii) Undergraduate participation in field- and laboratory-based research, (iii) Collaboration with the Maine Granite Industry Museum, where project results will be used to explain the glacial imprint on the surrounding landscape, and (iv) Evaluation of glacial erosion as a risk factor in planning for long-term isolation of nuclear waste in high-latitude countries."

0.823454,"Intellectual Merit: Replication of chromosomal DNA is accomplished by a dynamic protein assembly termed the replisome. Processivity clamps such as Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) are important constituents of the replisome that ensure processive replication. Sliding clamps also act as versatile scaffolds in the recruitment of cell-cycle control and DNA repair proteins and are engaged in almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Their remarkable ring-shaped architecture allows them to topologically encircle and slide along DNA. To fulfill their varied functions, the clamps have to strike a delicate balance between stability and the ability to open in order to be loaded onto DNA. Processivity clamps are opened and resealed at DNA primer-template junctions by the action of a clamp loader in a cycle involving ATP binding and hydrolysis. The project aims to delineate the detailed mechanisms for processivity clamp opening, determine the role of the clamp loader and describe the utilization of ATP during each step of the clamp loading cycle. Atomistic models for the intermediates in the cycle will be constructed to describe the conformational transitions leading to clamp opening and reclosing. This project will achieve a unified molecular-level description of the clamp loading processes and provide insight into clamp-associated activities and their essential roles in duplication of the genome and the regulation of genome fidelity. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: This project will substantially impact our knowledge of the biological mechanisms controlling genetic integrity with broad implications for biotechnology, environmental and bioenergy research. The project blends new methodologies and novel applications to create a multidisciplinary research and education program that is interesting and challenging for students of all levels. In particular, students will be introduced to a broad arsenal of theoretical methods, molecular modeling algorithms and High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures. Curricular innovation would involve development of a new module (advanced sampling, QM/MM and AIMD methods) for a graduate-level Computational Chemistry class at Georgia State University (GSU) and the introduction of Advanced Modeling seminars for the computational chemistry center at GSU. Additionally, molecular visualization will be used as an effective tool in attracting high school students to STEM fields with an emphasis on bringing students from disadvantaged backgrounds to the GSU campus.

0.053198,"For the first ~300 million years of plant life on land, Earth's flora consisted entirely of flagellate plants, which today include approximately 30,000 species of bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms.

0.273916,"Thermochronology - the study of temperature histories for geologic samples using the tools of isotope and nuclear geochemistry - has evolved into a fundamental part of earth system research. Just as the geochemistry community in the 1970's and 1980's led an explosion in the development of new isotopic tracers as probes of mantle and crustal evolution, the thermochronology community is now driving a rapid expansion in the temperature range and precision of temperature history reconstructions. Such reconstructions have a variety of applications to understanding aspects of earth system evolution relevant to society. Reconstructing the thermal history of sedimentary basins is essential for our determination of oil and gas potential. More generally, we know that thermal histories are of rocks in the upper crust are strongly influenced by erosional processes. Those processes are, in turn, influenced by climatic variations such that low-temperature thermochronometry - the focus of this research project - has become our primary means of reconstructing past climate fluctuations on timescales of millions of years. Such information is essential for us to establish long-term climate variations that can help us to better compare current climate trends to those further back in earth history, and to more fully evaluate the societal implications of extreme changes in climate. <br/><br/>The practical utility of mineral-isotopic systems for thermochronometry, is limited by the quality of our knowledge of helium diffusion kinetics. Recent experimental studies of apatite and zircon suggest that radiation damage substantially affects the diffusivity of helium. Recent studies of zircon suggest a strong helium diffusion anisotropy (orders of magnitude greater parallel to the c crystallographic direction). The investigators propose a study aimed at systematically quantifying both of these influences on helium diffusion on a variety of minerals with proven or anticipated value for (U-Th)/He thermochronometry: monazite, rutile, titanite, xenotime, and zircon. They will prepare samples with various levels of radiation damage through thermal annealing and proton irradiation for two kinds of diffusion experiments: 1) the more familiar incremental heating, bulk diffusion approach through which most of the currently available helium diffusion data were obtained; and 2) a newly developed laser ablation depth profiling approach that enables the interrogation of laboratory induced diffusion profiles in predetermined crystallographic orientations. The ultimate goal of the project will be to contribute to the development of a schema for assigning appropriately unique diffusion parameters to individual crystals so that themochronologists can more confidently use measured dates for thermal history reconstructions."

0.025038,"Research on migration in Archaeology has largely focused on its role as an agent of cultural change. However, migration and genetic admixture are also drivers of biological change and adaptation. Consequently, characterizing how ancient migrations shape genetic diversity is vital to inform understanding of biological ancestry, cultural evolution, and health outcomes in admixed human populations. But, because modern populations do not retain all the genomic diversity of ancient groups, genetic research with contemporary individuals provides limited resolution for reconstructing ancient demographic events. This limitation can be addressed by combining archaeological questions with ancient DNA. This investigation characterizes the genetic diversity of ancient human groups and test hypotheses about their relationships to other ancient and modern populations. Specifically, ancient DNA obtained from human skeletal remains in three archaeological sites (Tibes, Punta Candelero and Paso del Indio) will be analyzed to investigate the role of migration and genetic admixture in the history of pre-Columbian populations from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. The project incorporates training of undergraduate students in laboratory and analytical methods and contributes to the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences through training of a female, Puerto Rican doctoral student. The researchers will engage the public by disseminating project findings through Ask-A Biologist, an online resource for students, teachers and the public, and by collaborating with archaeologists and the Ceremonial Center of Tibes site museum to integrate findings in public site tours. A significant aspect of this research is the optimization of protocols for DNA recovery from degraded skeletal remains. This methodological development improves ancient DNA recovery from remains in tropical environments, and can be extended to forensic applications where DNA may be damaged due to corpse deposition in adverse preservation contexts. <br/><br/>Debate remains about how many migrants settled the island of Puerto Rico in antiquity, where they came from, and how these processes influenced social interaction networks across the ancient Caribbean basin. This investigation compares ancient mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from skeletal remains dated A.D. 500-1300, with data from other modern and ancient indigenous populations of the Americas to determine: (1) How were ancient populations in Puerto Rico related to continental Native American groups, and what may this indicate about their origins? (2) What was the extent of gene flow in the pre-contact Caribbean, and what may this indicate about local social interaction? Project findings reassess existing models for the peopling of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and explore how migration and admixture shaped the biocultural diversity of ancient Caribbean populations. By also examining the extent of inter-island migration and genetic exchange, this investigation elucidates the role of kinship, residence patterns and mobility in the maintenance of interaction networks across the pre-Columbian Caribbean. Lastly, this study also sheds light on the genetic relationships between pre-Columbian populations and modern Puerto Ricans, the second largest Hispanic group in the USA. Given the growing role that Native American ethnicity plays in contemporary Puerto Rican culture, project results have implications for the construction and experience of modern Puerto Rican identity."

Each focus system is characterized by strong correlations, with the latter two involving systems that are driven far from equilibrium.<br/><br/>Actinides compounds and complexes will be modeled in ways that account for strong correlations between the f-electrons, with the goal of developing the ability to make first-principles predictions of properties of actinides such as uranium and plutonium in the nuclear fuel cycle and as waste products in the environment. <br/><br/>High-frequency rectification at junctions of doped Mott insulators will be studied analytically and through numerical simulation. Diodes made of these materials may be able to operate up to optical frequencies, enabling nanoscale rectenna designs that could directly convert the electromagnetic field of sunlight to direct current. The conversion mechanism represents a mechanism that is fundamentally differs from the mechanism underlying traditional solar cell technology.<br/><br/>Macroturbulent Jets in anisotropic and inhomogenous fluid flows will be described statistically by methods that forgo standard approaches based upon accumulation of statistics during numerical simulation. Instead the flow statistics will be captured directly by non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through approximations that are inspired by quantum many-body theory, and that can be systematically improved.<br/><br/>The research provides an interdisciplinary environmental context for training students and postdocs.

0.19574,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Tribocorrosion is a material degradation process caused by the combined effects of wear and corrosion. It is a research area that emerged recently, driven by increased demand for wear- and corrosion-resistant materials from biomedical implants, nuclear power generation, marine and offshore industries, etc. The complexity of tribocorrosion lies in the fact that the chemical and mechanical attacks act synergistically to cause accelerated failure. The synergetic effect is most prominent for passive metals, such as stainless steels, titanium and aluminum alloys, which rely on the presence of a thin surface oxide film (passive film) as a protective barrier against corrosion. When mechanical wear takes place during corrosion, the passive film can be locally destroyed, with the ensuing depassivation leading to rapid corrosion and early component failure. This research seeks to offer insight concerning the degradation mechanisms during tribocorrosion of passive metals using experiments and modeling. The obtained results can lead to the development of new tribocorrosion resistant alloys and coatings with enhanced durability. Research opportunities and a mentorship program are created for undergraduate students and under-represented minorities. Relevant core undergraduate courses are updated to include tribocorrosion-related topics. The outreach program features hands-on demonstrations for girls in elementary and middle schools from Pinellas County, Florida, to stimulate their interest in STEM fields. Published and promoted videos demonstrating the physical concepts related to this research are on popular social media platforms to educate a broad and diverse audience about tribocorrosion. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Al exhibits excellent corrosion resistance but poor scratch resistance, which greatly limits its potential usage in industrial applications where mechanical contact and corrosive environment coexist. Recent studies from our group demonstrates that alloying Al with a transition metal (TM) in supersaturated solid solution has the potential of simultaneously increasing the wear resistance of Al alloys as well as the protectiveness of the passive layer, thus improving the overall tribocorrosion resistance. This research project is directed towards identifying how alloy concentration affects deformation and degradation during tribocorrosion and is centered on a comprehensive study that integrates material processing, characterization, tribocorrosion testing, and theoretical modeling. The proposed processing technique produces materials with various alloy concentrations while minimizing crystallographic texture and residual stress effects. Materials are characterized site-specifically to evaluate the microstructural modifications induced by different degradation mechanisms during tribocorrosion, including wear and corrosion and their synergistic and stochastic aspects. The specific technical objectives include (1) establishment of the alloy concentration/tribocorrosion resistance relationship for Al-TMs, (2) determination of whether an optimum alloy concentration exists for the best tribocorrosion resistance, and (3) investigation of whether (and how) in-service conditions (e.g., applied load, sliding speed) and corrosion conditions influence the tribocorrosion resistance. The obtained results help establish better guidelines for the application of metals in harsh environments and service conditions. The findings also serve to improve design principles for new tribocorrosion-resistant Al alloys, the use of which presents great potential for increasing the sustainability of global energy consumption."
0.2,"It is proposed to develop contactless ultrasonic surface wave propagation sensing system that can monitor structural health of large concrete structures, such as containment structures in a nuclear power plant. Contactless systems have high potential of being useful in characterizing damage in such structures because many data can be collected efficiently over a large area.

The results will enable new capabilities for rapid testing, scanning and characterization of critical large infrastructure systems. The research effort will be pursued by creating new sensing and testing capability, and a more complete understanding of wave propagation and scattering in such materials. Controlled concrete samples will be tested in the laboratory to characterize and interpret wave scattering features. <br/><br/>The objectives of this research are to improve fundamental understanding of surface wave propagation and scattering in concrete with distributed damage using a diffuse wave approach and to provide a new capability for completely contactless ultrasonic interrogation of concrete.

0.636991,"Sharon Hammes-Schiffer of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division and the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure to develop efficient and accurate computational methods that describe the coupled motion of electrons and protons in chemical and biological systems. The coupling between electrons and protons plays a vital role in a wide range of biological and chemical processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, and energy production in solar cells. It is difficult to develop computational approaches to accurately describe this coupling because electrons and protons are so light that they must be treated quantum mechanically. After extensive assessment and validation, these computational methods will be incorporated into a computer program that will be available to the public. Moreover, these computational methods will be applied to specific processes of biological and chemical relevance to elucidate the underlying fundamental principles that determine the processes. Professor Hammes-Schiffer and her research group maintain a web site that contains software and educational tools related to this topic. The computer programs, tools, demonstrations, and tutorials available on this web site enable scientists in a broad range of fields to learn about the coupled motion of electrons and protons. In addition, this project will facilitate technological and biomedical advances through a better understanding of this important research area. An important example is the design of more effective solar cells and other alternative, renewable energy sources. Another example is the design of more effective drugs through modification of enzymes that rely on the coupling between electrons and protons.<br/><br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop new theoretical and computational approaches to provide insight into the underlying fundamental principles of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. These reactions play a vital role in a broad range of biological and chemical processes. The specific issues to be examined include the roles of nuclear quantum effects, hydrogen tunneling, and non-Born-Oppenheimer effects, which are thought to be significant in PCET. These issues will be explored using the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach, in which all electrons and the transferring proton(s) are treated quantum mechanically on the same level with molecular orbital methods or density functional theory. This approach enables the calculation of key quantities in PCET theories for determining rates and mechanisms. It is also applicable to a wide range of other chemical and biological systems. A major goal of this project is to develop algorithms to enhance the computational efficiency of this approach, assess and validate the methodology, and port the NEO code to GAMESS, a general quantum chemistry package available to the public. The NEO method benefits from the optimized components of other parts of the general electronic structure package, and portions of the NEO code will be useful to other scientists.

0.939954,"Potassium ion (K+) channels allow the rapid and specific flow of potassium ions across membranes in a regulated way, and are significant for many physiological functions in organisms from bacteria to humans. Opening of the channels and the resulting flow of K+ through the membrane is induced by a change in membrane voltage or by interaction with ligands. Because potassium channels are of such importance for normal physiological function, many organisms have evolved toxins that target channels, and these toxins have been used as important tools in the study of channel function and structure. Preliminary studies identified a toxin (Tx7335) from the eastern green mamba snake (Dendroaspis angusticeps) that increases frequency and duration of channel openings in the bacterial potassium channel KcsA. This is a very unusual function for a toxin that interacts directly with the potassium-conducting domain of the channel, as most such toxins act as blockers of K+ currents. The functional effect of Tx7335 therefore represents a new mechanism of K+-channel regulation. The main research objective of this project is to understand the basis for the functional effect of Tx7335, and in particular the details of the interaction between channel and toxin and the structural changes that toxin binding induces in the channel. In order to probe the surface of the channel that interacts with the toxin, individual amino acid residues on the external surface of KcsA that may interact with the toxin will be mutated to a different amino acid. If the original amino acid is indeed important in the interaction, then the expectation is that the mutation will lead to a different response of the mutant channel to the toxin. The response will be tested by measuring potassium currents flowing through all mutant channels in artificial bilayers with and without added toxin. A rough mapping of the toxin binding site will be possible in this way. Mutations will also be made on the toxin to identify residues on the surface of the toxin that interact with the channel. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) experiments will be used to obtain higher-resolution structural information of the channel-toxin interactions. This technique allows the characterization of the binding interface and the detection of structural changes upon toxin binding to be performed with atomic resolution. These experiments will eventually allow resolving the three-dimensional toxin-channel complex structure. This knowledge will advance understanding of K+ channel function and regulation, with relevance for a large number of biological processes in animals that are dependent on influx of potassium ions. In addition, this understanding will also be relevant to plant physiology, where highly homologous potassium channels are involved in potassium uptake and transport as well as in the opening and closing of stomata by regulating the turgor pressure of the surrounding guard cells. Lastly, ion channel toxins selective for insect channels may also be very useful as insecticides with reduced negative environmental impact, and better understanding of toxin-channel interactions will be beneficial in guiding the development of such pest control approaches in agriculture.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/> The project will provide an opportunity for the integration of research in education and will contribute to the training of the next generation of students in Staten Island and the greater New York City area with a special emphasis on students who are historically underrepresented in science. Undergraduate and high-school students participants will be recruited from the College of Staten Island, from LaGuardia Community College (a minority-serving institution), and from high-need local Staten Island high schools. Students will be closely mentored to promote development of their scientific and critical thinking skills and to increase their preparation to succeed in science. An outreach program through the Discovery Institute at the College of Staten Island will involve developing and disseminating teaching modules based on the proposed research suitable for implementation at the high-school level. These programs will be created by interested teachers in collaboration with the PI and Discovery Institute experts, and will be based on analysis of structural data pertaining to the project using molecular visualization software. Students will suggest mutations that would affect toxin binding and upload these to the project web site. Submissions will be functionally tested by the research staff and the final experiments will be streamed back to the high school and archived as video podcasts on the project server. The implementation of these modules will help to create excitement for science and engage students in hypothesis-driven research through media that the students are already familiar with (computer 3D software, webcasts and online video). Lastly, the curriculum for the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course that the PI teaches at the College of Staten Island will also be redesigned as a research-based course drawing from elements of the research project. This exposure to actual research in a mandatory lab course will enrich student's understanding of the nature of science and the design of research. In summary, the research will serve as a vehicle to increase scientific interest, literacy and fluency among involved undergraduate students as well as local high-school teachers and students."

0.075888,"As the most commonly observed objects, stars remain at the forefront of astrophysical research. Technical advances in detectors, computer processing power, networks and data storage have enabled new sky surveys. Many of these search for transient events at optical wavelengths, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS1 that probe ever-larger areas of the sky and ever-fainter sources, opening up the vast discovery space of ""time domain astronomy"". The recent Kepler and COROT space missions achieved nearly continuous monitoring of more than 100,000 stars. The stellar discoveries from these surveys include revelations about stellar evolution, rare stars, unusual explosion outcomes, and remarkably complex binary star systems. The immediate future holds tremendous promise, as both the space-based survey Gaia and the ground based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come to fruition. This tsunami of data has created a new demand for a reliable and publicly available research and education tool in computational stellar astrophysics that will reap the full scientific benefits of these discoveries while also creating a collaborative environment where theory, computation and interpretation can come together to address critical scientific issues. This demand by the stellar community led to our release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project in 2011. MESA has driven, and will continue to drive with support from this award, innovation in the stellar community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, and cosmological communities. Educators have widely deployed MESA in their undergraduate and graduate stellar evolution courses because MESA is a community platform with an active support network for leading-edge scientific investigations. Stellar astrophysics research, and all the communities that rely on stellar astrophysics, will be significantly enhanced by sustaining innovative development of MESA.<br/><br/>This award supports the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project and user community.

MESA is an open source library that employs contemporary numerical approaches, supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP, and is written with present and future multi-core and multi-thread architectures in mind. MESA combines the robust, efficient, thread-safe numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars. Innovations in MESA and its domain of applicability continues to grow, just recently extended to include giant planets, oscillations, and rotation.

Such extreme environments include the Early Universe, during primordial nucleosynthesis of light nuclei such as hydrogen through lithium just after the Big Bang; the merger through inspiraling of neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries; and the death throes of massive stars, more than ten times the mass of the Sun, in stellar explosions known as core-collapse supernovae, which are responsible for elements such as oxygen and calcium without which life as we know it would not exist. Radiation transport and kinetic theory of particles besides neutrinos---photons, electrons, or neutrons---are also relevant to many areas of astrophysics, as well as a broad range of other science applications, including materials science, plasma physics, neutron transport, multiphase flows, and high-energy-density physics.

In particular, the radiation transport solver will utilize the extant capabilities of GenASiS for adaptive computational ""mesh refinement,"" whereby the representation of the natural continuum is captured adaptively on a mesh of points foundational to any computational model in order to maximize the fidelity of the computational model for a given computational cost. We will use the so-called M1 approach, solving directly for the zeroth and first angular moments (energy density and momentum) of the radiation field, with higher-order moments given by ""closure relations,"" expressing them in terms of the zeroth and first moments. The energy dependence of the radiation field will be retained, with the zeroth and first angular moments discretized into ""energy bins."" Our computational approach to neutrino radiation transport will be an ""implicit-explicit"" (IMEX) scheme. Interactions between radiation and matter will be handled with a time-implicit subsolver, which will involve the inversion of dense matrices local to each node of the machine to exploit all available hardware in the node, including accelerators and coprocessors when available. Algorithms and software resulting from this project will be made available to the community. GenASiS, as an extensible, object-oriented simulation framework, will be valuable to researchers seeking to experiment with and implement different kinds of solvers for multi-physics problems. In particular, the neutrino hydrodynamics solver developed in this project is of high interest to astrophysics modelers."
0.214357,"In order to develop the next generation of clean and efficient vehicle engines and power-generating combustors, engineers need the next generation of computational modeling tools. Accurately describing the chemistry of conventional and alternative liquid transportation fuels is vital to predict harmful emission levels and other important quantities, but the high computational cost of detailed models for chemistry poses a significant barrier to use by designers. In order to use such accurate models, software is needed that can efficiently handle chemistry in practical simulations. This collaborative project aims to develop such tools, employing the computational power of modern parallelized central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). In addition to helping designers create clean and efficient engine technology, the advances made in this project are widely applicable to other computational modeling problems including astrophysics, nuclear reactions, atmospheric chemistry, biochemical networks, and even cardiac electrophysiology.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed effort is to develop software elements specifically targeted at co-processing on GPUs, CPUs, and other many-core accelerator devices to reduce the computational cost of using detailed chemistry and enable high-fidelity yet affordable reactive-flow simulations. This will be achieved by (1) developing and comparing chemical kinetics integration algorithms for parallel operation on CPUs and GPUs/accelerators, (2) developing a method for detecting local stiffness due to chemical kinetics and adaptively selecting the most efficient solver based on available hardware, (3) implementing a computational cell clustering strategy to group similar spatial locations, (4) demonstrating the improved performance offered by these software elements using commercial and open-source computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling reactive flows, and (5) designing a portable and sustainable software library based on the above software elements, including building a community of users. The result of this program will be an open source software library that significantly decreases the cost of using detailed, accurate chemistry in realistic combustion simulations; the success of the program will be determined based on achieving order-of-magnitude performance improvement or better."

0.30684,"As the most commonly observed objects, stars remain at the forefront of astrophysical research. Technical advances in detectors, computer processing power, networks and data storage have enabled new sky surveys. Many of these search for transient events at optical wavelengths, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS1 that probe ever-larger areas of the sky and ever-fainter sources, opening up the vast discovery space of ""time domain astronomy"". The recent Kepler and COROT space missions achieved nearly continuous monitoring of more than 100,000 stars. The stellar discoveries from these surveys include revelations about stellar evolution, rare stars, unusual explosion outcomes, and remarkably complex binary star systems. The immediate future holds tremendous promise, as both the space-based survey Gaia and the ground based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come to fruition. This tsunami of data has created a new demand for a reliable and publicly available research and education tool in computational stellar astrophysics that will reap the full scientific benefits of these discoveries while also creating a collaborative environment where theory, computation and interpretation can come together to address critical scientific issues. This demand by the stellar community led to our release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project in 2011. MESA has driven, and will continue to drive with support from this award, innovation in the stellar community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, and cosmological communities. Educators have widely deployed MESA in their undergraduate and graduate stellar evolution courses because MESA is a community platform with an active support network for leading-edge scientific investigations. Stellar astrophysics research, and all the communities that rely on stellar astrophysics, will be significantly enhanced by sustaining innovative development of MESA.<br/><br/>This award supports the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project and user community. MESA solves the 1D fully coupled structure and composition equations governing stellar evolution. It is based on an implicit finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls; state-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion, boundary conditions, and changes to the mass of the star. MESA is an open source library that employs contemporary numerical approaches, supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP, and is written with present and future multi-core and multi-thread architectures in mind. MESA combines the robust, efficient, thread-safe numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars. Innovations in MESA and its domain of applicability continues to grow, just recently extended to include giant planets, oscillations, and rotation.

0.15,"Moore's Law, which predicts that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years, has been a major driver for the US economy for decades. Unfortunately, technological and fundamental challenges associated with continued device shrinking make the current rate of progress unsustainable. Recently, 3D integrated circuit technology has emerged as a leading approach to keep up with Moore's Law by stacking chips rather than by shrinking device dimensions. To achieve 3D integration, new joining technologies for interconnection and stacked bonding must be developed. Bonding by low volume solder interconnects is specially promising due to their good electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. This collaborative research award supports fundamental research to obtain the knowledge needed for the development of low volume solder interconnects. Research results will not only help realize the full potential of this new bonding technique in 3D integrated circuit packaging, but also be used to improve joining methodologies important in the aerospace and nuclear power industries and in power electronics and thermal management applications. Moreover, the project will help establish an effective collaboration between the two PIs who are both from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The small dimensions of low volume solder interconnects make it possible for the solder joints to solidify isothermally through the formation of intermetallic compounds at the expense of the liquid solders. This technique, also known as Transient Liquid Phase Bonding, allows the formation of a joint at temperatures lower than the expected operating conditions, minimizing damage to the temperature-sensitive components of the circuits from overheating. However, the small dimensions of low volume solder interconnects lead to large current densities during operation. These large current densities induce large electrical, thermal, and mechanical driving forces which give rise to complex microstructural processes. This research aims to advance the fundamental understanding of the complex microstructure processes in low volume solder interconnects, in particular about the important microscopic mechanisms governing processing-microstructure-property-performance relationships. The research team will develop an integrated multi-physics phase field modeling and perform systematic simulation studies of the microstructure formation and evolution during processing, operation, and damage of low volume solder interconnects. The simulations will be used to correlate macroscopic processing parameters and operating conditions to microscopic phenomena involving diffusion, current flow, heat transfer and stress concentration, and elucidate the mechanisms of defect formation."
0.39,"With this award from the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Burjor Captain of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Miami will explore the structures and reactivity of transition metal complexes containing bulky tin ligands. The main drive is to indice activation of hydrogen and small molecules as well as to investigate their potential as hydroformylation and hydrogenation catalysts. The work will consist of incorporating sterically encumbered tin ligands to bring about electronic and/or coordinative unsaturation around the metal atoms in transition metal complexes. This work will begin by exploring synthetic, structural, and catalytic chemistry on platinum-tin systems and then be extended to include complexes of non-precious transition metals such as Ni and Fe. The central theme is the use of tin which offers significant advantages and is largely untested. There is precedent for the potential scope and effectiveness of this strategy in the widely investigated use of phosphine ligands to modify both binding sites and catalytic properties. However, bulky tin ligands offer additional incentives for their investigation compared to phosphine ligands. Because the stannyl group is a radical with an odd number of electrons, its utilization at a metal site changes formal oxidation numbers, but more importantly electron densities at the metal center, in ways quite different from that of coordinated phosphines. The long range goal of this work is development of robust, economic, and efficient catalysts of use to chemical industry.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project is that it calls for synthesis of a new class of materials in a relatively unexplored area of inorganic chemistry. This provides the opportunity to discover new binding patterns of small molecules. Some of these may be predictable, but some may be unanticipated and lead to new insights of broad impact in fundamental chemical science. There has been a renaissance in main group chemistry, and this work combines main group with transition metal chemistry in an exciting and potentially breakthrough area. The proposed small molecule activation studies center on hydrogen- by trying to understand how it behaves in a main group metal-transition group metal setting. Transition metal complexes have and always will play the crucial part in the chemistry of hydrogen, but this may be modified by the presence of the added bulky tin ligand. The question is how and to what extent it will be modified. The long term impact of this work will be in helping to better utilize this important resource in binding and catalytic reactivity. A final area of impact is in student training (undergraduate and graduate) to be scientists and professionals. Students will be trained to prepare and handle air-sensitive compounds, and will learn various methods such as X-Ray crystallography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, calorimetry and computational analysis. The results will be broadly disseminated in refereed research journals and through presentations at meetings. Due to the diversity of the proposed research, students trained in this program will have the skill set and creative attitude needed to find viable solutions for the emerging energy crisis and contribute to sustainability."

0.185492,"Rayleigh-Taylor instability and turbulent mixing governs a wide variety of plasma phenomena in nature and technology, spanning astrophysical to microscopic scales and low to high energy density regimes. It influences the formation of the 'hot spot' in inertial confinement fusion, limits radial compression of imploding Z-pinches, drives penetration of stellar ejecta into pulsar wind nebula, dominates energy transport in core-collapse supernova, provides conditions for synthesis of heavy mass elements in thermonuclear stellar flashes, controls material transformation under high strain rates, and strongly affects the dynamics of shocks and blast waves. Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops when matters (plasmas) of different densities are accelerated against the density gradients. The induced material mixing is a complex (anisotropic, inhomogeneous and statistically unsteady) turbulent process, whose theoretical description requires novel approaches that go well beyond the domain of idealized canonical considerations. The tremendous successes achieved recently in high energy density plasma experiments and in large-scale numerical simulations, and the striking similarity of behavior of Rayleigh-Taylor mixing in vastly different physical regimes make this moment right for a theory to appear and to advance knowledge of fundamental aspects of the non-equilibrium turbulent processes in plasmas.<br/><br/>The core of this theoretical approach is a new concept, the invariance of the rate of momentum loss. This concept will be applied to capture the transports of mass, momentum and energy in Rayleigh-Taylor mixing plasmas and to study invariants, scale coupling, scaling, and statistics of the turbulent process. Group theory and stochastic analysis considerations will be employed, and coherence and randomness of the dynamics will be analyzed and related to space-time symmetries of the conservation laws. Incorporating the high energy density conditions, the dependencies of integral characteristics of plasma mixing will be investigated and their connection will be established to the control parameters of simulations and experiments (e.g. target non-uniformities in high-power laser experiments). The developed theoretical foundations will be further applied to analyze existing datasets and to advance the design of experiments and simulations. The project will impact a broad range of disciplines in science, mathematics and engineering, including plasmas, high energy density physics, astrophysics, mathematical physics, stochastic processes, fluid dynamics, and material science, as well as technology in the areas of nuclear energy and communications. It will also initiate a new program for graduate education on modern methods of theoretical modeling and advanced data analysis techniques. The theoretical tools will be communicated through and contribute to the development of a newly emerging international research community 'Turbulent mixing and beyond.'"
0.151408,"Each cell of an organism shares the same nuclear DNA sequence (genome), but different types of cells turn on different sets of genes to carry out their unique functions. To correctly turn on and off the needed sets of genes requires coordinated action by several hundred regulatory molecules. The regulators interact with the genome and with each other: understanding how this happens is one of the most important questions biological researchers are trying to answer. This project will use chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, which measures where a particular regulator is located on the genome: this may be zero, one or a few hundred positions out of the billions possible in a genome. Regulators often act together and one may change the action of another, so another part of the proposed work is to discover sites where regulators are co-localized. However, co-localization alone does not show whether regulators interact directly, or indirectly through an intermediate. The overall goal of this project is to develop a computational framework that identifies direct and indirect interactions among regulators, using thousands of ChIP-seq datasets. This framework will develop novel statistical and machine learning techniques to overcome the limitations of existing methods. The techniques that are developed will be applied to answer the following fundamental questions: How do hundreds of regulators interact with each other to regulate the genome? How do these regulator interactions differ across cell types? How do these interactions differ across different species (human, mouse, fly and worm)? The implementation of the new methods will be made publicly available to help many other scientists to study how the human genome works. This project is interdisciplinary in nature and has significant emphasis on interdisciplinary education, through project courses and outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>Identifying the interactions among chromatin regulators, such as transcription factors and histone modifications, is of paramount importance to understand genome regulation. To infer this network of interactions, this research will compare multiple chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets, each measuring genome-wide localization of a chromatin regulator. Co-localization may indicate that two regulators interact directly or indirectly through transitive interactions. To identify direct interactions, the proposal aims to develop novel network inference methods to infer conditional dependence relationships (i.e., correlation not explained via any other variables in the network) among a large number of ChIP-seq datasets. While network inference has become a commonly used analysis tool for other types of data, such as gene expression data, the immense size of the ChIP-seq data sets and the strong redundancies present in the data limit the use of existing network inference methods. To resolve these challenges, this research proposes a novel machine learning (ML) framework to enable network inference from large collections of ChIP-seq data: 1) efficient ML methods to infer the chromatin network based on the entire ENCODE ChIP-seq data that contain redundancies; 2) new ML methods to jointly infer the context-specific chromatin networks and the associated genomic contexts by incorporating other types of genomic data; and 3) new ML methods to learn a conserved chromatin network across species and predict chromatin factor interactions even if the factors are not measured in the species of study.

0.203427,"Subduction zones are where one of Earth's tectonic plates moves under another resulting in many of the world's largest earthquakes and damaging tsunamis. One example is the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan that killed more than 20,000 people and crippled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex. These earthquakes arise from friction on the subduction zone fault that separates the two tectonic plates. The temperature of the subduction fault zone affects this friction and can control the size and distribution of earthquakes. In addition, subduction zone temperatures affect a wide range of other physical and chemical processes, including the generation of magma that supplies nearby volcanoes. To understand these processes, it is important to accurately estimate subduction zone temperatures. Recent discoveries show that seawater circulating within the subducting tectonic plates is an important control on subduction zone temperatures. This project will examine how fractures that open in the upper part of a tectonic plate as it bends down into a subduction zone affect seawater circulation in the system and how that affects subduction zone temperatures. The project will develop numerical thermal models for seven subduction zones. Application of the results of this research has direct societal benefit, by informing earthquake hazard estimates. In addition, the project will enhance education at New Mexico Tech, a STEM-focused Hispanic-serving institution. A graduate student will be trained in geophysics and hydrogeology. Results of the project will be incorporated into ""using data in the classroom"" efforts, improving hands-on experience in undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>Accurate subduction zone thermal models are necessary to understand frictional behavior, metamorphic reaction progress, release of volatiles from the subducting slab, mantle wedge hydration, subduction dynamics, and melt generation. Fluid circulation in an oceanic crustal aquifer is an important control on subduction zone temperatures. However, there are contrasting hypotheses for how much of the oceanic crust can host vigorous hydrothermal circulation. Both thickening of the oceanic crustal aquifer via plate bending normal faults and fluid circulation between subducted crust and the crust seaward of the trench may contribute to the advective redistribution of heat that affects subduction zone temperatures. This project will test the hypothesis that the thermal effects of aquifer thickening prior to subduction are greater for slabs with a greater degree of curvature. This project will exploit the fact that aquifer thickening from the outer rise to the trench and continued fluid circulation in subducting crust are expected to produce distinct surface heat flux anomalies (a broad low amplitude anomaly for aquifer thickening; a narrow high amplitude anomaly for fluid circulation in subducting crust) in order to constrain the thermal effects of each process. This will advance our understanding of the fluid circulation process that is an important control on subduction zone temperatures, improving subduction zone thermal models for the seven margins examined in this project and others."

In this project, supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Yoshitaka Ishii of the University of Illinois at Chicago and his research group will establish a new framework of next-generation NMR spectroscopy for biomoleculces and materials in solids, which is generally called solid-state NMR (SSNMR). The proposed work would aim to increase the speeds of the data collection 50-6000 fold over a traditional method by integrating advanced methods such as 1H detection, novel isotope labeling, and paramagnetic doping into a non-traditional SSNMR approach using an ultra high magnetic field and very fast magic angle spinning. The second component of the research involves SSNMR analysis of peptides and proteins during solid-phase peptide synthesis, which reveals the structural changes of the protein during the reactions. The third component is to examine graphene/graphite based nano materials, in particular, chemical reactions of graphene oxide and graphite oxide and the interactions of H2O with porous grapheme-based systems. <br/><br/>Ishii's research will advance NMR technology applications to a broader range of insoluble proteins and non-crystalline materials, which cannot be analyzed by other tools such as x-ray crystallography. Advances in the Ishii group research will likely have impacts in the many venues of NMR based technology, including nanomaterials analysis and peptide science. Professor Ishii will integrate his research into his educational activities by establishing a new graduate course on solid-state NMR with hands-on experiments.

0.174997,"This study advances the development of new collaborative communication tools that promote effective handoffs, assesses the use of these tools to streamline communication, and contributes to a medical school and health informatics curricula of handoff strategies to improve collaboration. Handoffs are a shift-based communication activity in round-the-clock settings such as space mission controls, nuclear power plants, and healthcare settings that help in maintaining the continuity of work activities. In healthcare settings, patient handoffs involve the transfer of information, responsibility and authority, from one care provider to another. Despite their importance, patient handoffs are often of poor quality leading to adverse events and patient harm. To improve handoff quality, structured handoff tools should be used for ensuring consistent communication between care providers. However, we know very little about how such structured tools support collaborative communication between care providers. This study will conduct a systematic evaluation of handoff communication at two acute care settings to characterize the role of structured handoff tools for sustaining collaborative activities.<br/><br/>This multi-site pilot study will investigate the impact of standardized handoff tools on: (a) effective information transfer, (b) symmetric and balanced social interaction, and (c) resilient communication. It will be carried out within the context of interdepartmental physician handoffs between Emergency Departments (ED) and Medical Intensive Care Units (MICU). Multi-faceted research methods will be used, including (a) clinician shadowing and audio-recording of ED-MICU handoffs, (b) a post-handoff interaction questionnaire with participating ED and MICU physicians, (c) handoff tool collection, and (d) handoff evaluation huddles to perform a situated in-depth evaluation of handoff tools within the context of patient handoffs. This research will contribute towards developing an integrated perspective on the development of structured physician handoffs tools and communication in three ways. First, it will strengthen our empirical insights of the collaborative processes that underlie handoff activities. This will involve a comprehensive understanding of the nuances of interactive communication and the role of social interactions and communication resilience for supporting effective handoffs. Second, it will inform the design of handoff tools. This will involve the identification of information organization aspects for handoff tools that will facilitate effective interactive and error-free communication. Third, it will integrate theoretical and methodological implications of this work into graduate courses on patient safety and communication to expose and also attract students in a health informatics program to research careers in information sciences and computing.

In addition to advancing the fundamental knowledge of polymerization chemistry, this research aims to produce new conjugated polymers with potential application as opto-electronic materials. As a part of the broader impacts of this project, the Hu Group is training students and graduate students with state-of-art instruments and techniques for the preparation and characterization of advanced materials. <br/><br/>Professor Hu's research group seeks to exploit Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling chemistry for controlled polymerizations in the preparation of conjugated polymers/block copolymers. Controlled Pd(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling polymerizations have recently emerged as new tools for the synthesis of conjugated polymers such as poly(arylene)s and poly(aryleneethynylene)s with controlled degree of polymerization. However, limitations exist for reported controlled Pd(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling polymerizations, which include promising but less than ideal polydispersity indexes (PDIs)(~1.20 in general), limited monomer scope, e.g., mainly donor-based AB-type monomers, and difficulty to control chain end functionality. Such limitations greatly impede their applications as powerful tools for the preparation of many valuable conjugated polymers and block copolymers with controlled length, which have great potential in molecular electronics and nanotechnology as well as in fields ranging from semiconductors, sensors to optoelectronics. In this project, the specific foci are: (a) the preparation of new palladacycle-based initiators; and (b) the development of controlled Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling polymerizations of acceptor-based and donor-acceptor monomers for the preparation of AB-type and AA/BB-type polymers and block copolymers. The resulting materials are analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and other characterization techniques."

This research introduces a new mathematical model to infer hybridization over the tree of life, and tests the model with DNA data from a group of highly hybridizing evening primrose plants that grow in the harsh habitats of the Sonoran, Mojave and Great Basin deserts. This project also will provide bioinformatics and training and research experience to undergraduates, and produce computer software to detect hybridization events that will be disseminated freely via the Internet.<br/><br/>Hybridization is an important evolutionary process in a substantial portion of the tree of life that may act as an evolutionary catalyst by increasing the adaptive variation within lineages.

This research incorporates both empirical and theoretical work to address the challenges of inferring hybridization and examining its evolutionary significance. The researchers will use next-generation sequencing and genomic datasets to study the evolutionary consequences of introgression and historical biogeography across a homoploid hybrid complex in the plant genus Chylismia (Onagraceae). They also will apply both empirical datasets and simulated datasets to develop and test a novel Bayesian approach for detecting introgression that combines aspects of both phylogenetic and coalescent theory.

The processes of growth and development in plants depend on stem cells that divide and differentiate, but little is known about the mechanisms that govern stem cell differentiation. Understanding the properties that govern stem cell differentiation into different cell types (termed the cell fate decision process) is important for understanding the transition from single stem cells into mature cells and ultimately tissues and plants. This project engages research teams from the US (North Carolina State University) and the UK (University of Cambridge) to address the complex signals and regulatory programs that orchestrate cell fate decisions. Iron is an essential plant micronutrient which when deficient affects plant developmental processes, and this project will develop mathematical models to predict the emergent behaviors that are seen in response to changing iron availability. This project will provide insights into biological mechanisms common to all organisms and has important implications for agriculture and food security in terms of increased crop yield in response to stress. The combined use of experimental and mathematical modeling approaches will provide new interdisciplinary educational opportunities in biomathematics and molecular biology, engaging students (including groups underrepresented in science) at levels from kindergarten through high school and including undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project integrates experimental and computational approaches to identify gene regulatory and signaling networks that govern the progression of plant stem cell differentiation. The project will employ computational modeling approaches to predict cellular responses to intrinsic and extrinsic cues related to iron availability and its impact on phloem sieve element differentiation. The termination stage of sieve element development is characterized by programmed nuclear degradation. Differentiation of the sieve element is a powerful model for this kind of study because of a relatively rapid progression. Ordinary differential equations will be developed to assess how gene expression dynamics affect the differentiation of sieve elements. These equations will be incorporated into an Agent Based Model to enable the simulation of multiple cells differentiating simultaneously. The iteration of experimentation and model refinement will be instrumental for understanding the genes and networks that govern this differentiation process.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."
0.30955,"PI: Phillip R. Westmoreland<br/>Proposal Number: 1512401<br/><br/>The transportation of woody biomass to a central processing facility for conversion into useful liquid fuels can be costly, particularly in sparsely populated rural areas. Torrefaction is process that reduces the weight and volume of plant biomass to a form which can be transported more easily. In torrefaction, harvested biomass is heated in the absence of air at 200 to 300 degrees Celsius to create a dense bio-oil rich feedstock. However, this material is not very well characterized and contains a wide variety of compounds in gas, liquid, and solid forms. This project will develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the torrefaction of biomass that will predict the energy requirements and final product mixture, using knowledge of the detailed reaction processes. This model will then be used to develop torrefaction processes that can be tailored to make an energy-dense, low-oxygen material from woody biomass. Research results will be used to provide examples in engineering classes at undergraduate and graduate levels, and to enable the development of classroom materials on biofuel topics for high school students through the involvement of high school teachers in research.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive model for the elementary reactions and kinetics during the torrefaction of the hemicellulose fraction of woody biomass. In torrefaction, the biomass is heated in an inert atmosphere at 200 to 300 degrees C. It is hypothesized that pericyclic reactions, which are known to describe cellulose pyrolysis accurately, also describe the torrefaction of hemicellulose. The model will be developed using reaction kinetics experiments, computational quantum chemistry, and reaction theory. Thermogravimetric analyses will provide instantaneous heats of pyrolysis. Product gases and vapors will be profiled in real time by two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS). These experiments will be carried out with solid samples of woody biomass (loblolly pine), the hemicellulose biopolymers xylan and galactoglucomannan, and hemicellulose monomers xylose, arabinose, mannose, and galactose. The reaction processes for the flash pyrolysis of the torrefied solids will be studied by online GCxGC-TOFMS analysis of the bio-oil product vapors, complimented by analysis of the residual solid structures using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Quantum-chemistry analyses of monomer torrefaction will be expected to yield additional mechanistic insights. The full model will predict reaction kinetics and products of the torrefaction of cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of woody biomass. Educational activities based on the research include mentoring of an undergraduate process design team on the design of a thermochemical biomass processing plant, development of course materials for reaction kinetics and transport courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and research experiences for undergraduates and high school teachers."
0.433162,"The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to develop an understanding of the atomic scale grain boundary structure dependence of corrosion enhancing precipitation in fcc metals. Corrosion has a devastating effect on many industries, including nuclear, naval ship structures, and off-shore wind turbines. Grain boundary engineering has been shown to improve boundary dependent properties including creep, intergranular stress corrosion, embrittlement, and fatigue. However, questions remain about the anisotropic nature of both the segregation and precipitation relevant to all sensitization dependent failure in fcc materials. This project will focus on understanding the dependence of grain boundary structure on the precipitation that causes corrosion damage. The results generated from this study will serve as a predictive tool for developing future alloys resistant to deleterious intergranular precipitation in extreme environments. The work will use an experimental approach to analyze the combined effects temperature, environment, and grain boundary type on corrosion-causing precipitation mechanisms, which will ultimately yield a clearer understanding of corrosion in a wide range of alloys.<br/><br/>This research is expected to advance the fundamental understanding of mechanisms of fcc metal failure under corrosion, one of the most important structural materials in use today. Philadelphia has ~80% minority student population, so the opportunity to bring underrepresented groups into STEM fields is enormous. The PI plans to develop a program, named ""TURBINE"" (Transforming Underrepresented Research Basis in Engineering), for local high school minority and female students to learn about future careers in energy-related fields to spur an interest in research and development and engineering education/training for a future economy both in Philadelphia and globally."
0.016335,"Southeast Asia is one of the most intriguing and understudied biodiversity hotspots in the world. A prominent geological feature of this area is the Sunda Shelf, which is currently submerged beneath the South China Sea and underlies the Malay Archipelago. This region has a complex geological and climatic history, and serves as an excellent system to study drivers of biotic diversification. One group that occurs throughout this region is the rock gecko genus Cnemaspis. Theses geckos live on various substrates including different types of vegetation and rocks, including limestone, which is heavily mined in Southeast Asia for the production of cement. Mining and clearance of rainforest comprise serious threats to the unique biodiversity of this region. Studies of the endemic organisms of this region can contribute to conservation planning through the discovery of cryptic species and identification of local areas of high species diversity. This kind of knowledge is crucial to the implementation of effective science-based conservation strategies. This study will also further our understanding of the processes of speciation and adaptation to unique local environments, and the long-term accumulation of biodiversity which make this part of Asia so rich in endemic species. Portions of this research will be used to train undergraduates, and to develop a public display about biodiversity and species discovery at the Bean Life Science Museum at Brigham Young University. <br/> The genus Cnemaspis is widespread throughout Southeast Asia and is one of the most species-rich gecko genera in the region, with 54 described species. These presumed low vagility geckos live on a variety of substrates and vary in ecomorphology; and the clade is characterized by a number of micro-endemics, making it a great system for evolutionary study. In this project we will: (1) generate a well-supported multilocus time-calibrated phylogeny of the genus and test spatial and temporal divergence across the Sunda Shelf; (2) evaluate whether the polytomy in the preliminary phylogeny for the genus is 'hard' or 'soft', and if the former, whether it is an adaptive or non-adaptive radiation; and (3) investigate the effects on Cnemaspis species diversification (e.g. speciation and extinction rates) derived from the convergent evolution of ecomorphological characters. Currently one mitochondrial gene and three nuclear gene sequences resolve well-supported clades towards the tips of the tree, but fail to resolve deeper nodes. To test the hard vs. soft polytomy hypotheses, a 'Next Generation' sequence-capture method will be used to generate hundreds of loci. From this dataset a phylogenetic tree will be constructed to explicitly test alternative biogeographic hypotheses for colonization of parts of Sundaland, as well as test morphological disparity through time (DTT), convergent adaptive regime shifts, and evolution of ecomorphological characters."
1.2,"The pace of digitization and interconnection of hospital systems has increased tremendously as recent healthcare legislation has encouraged the interoperation of medical record systems. In addition to ordinary business operations data, hospital enterprise networks now carry patient record data and life-critical data streams from therapy systems (e.g., nuclear medicine, dialysis clinical systems). Unfortunately, the security implications of interconnecting such life-critical systems has been largely unstudied. This project is performing a large-scale analysis of the University of Florida Health System to detect the presence of malware and security weaknesses and determine whether security best-practices and techniques are sufficient to protect life-critical and privacy-sensitive medical systems.<br/><br/>While multiple recent studies have shown that individual medical devices are vulnerable toattack,none have assessed the current state of security at scale across medical organizations.This project is conducting a large-scale analysis of the current security posture of the University of Florida Health System to inform a data-driven approach to vulnerability mitigation. The researchers are first characterizing the security posture of the system through network-based measurements of malware presence (via Domain Name System (DNS) resolutions) and use of proper encryption practices (via inspection of X.509 certificates). The project is next developing techniques to dynamically fingerprint and limit risky communications patterns and inject strong certificates into communication flows. Finally, the project is developing techniques to predict devices at risk using algorithms that detect abnormal communication patterns via contact graphs."
0.4,"Proposal Number: 1351545<br/>PI: Desjardins, Olivier<br/><br/>The proposed CAREER project is focused on the computational investigation of the fluid physics at the interface between two fluids moving in the turbulent flow regime. This research and education project aims at improving the state of theoretical understanding of turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows using recently advanced numerical methods in conjunction with high performance computing resources. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive mechanistic and statistical theory of turbulence for interface interactions in liquid-gas flows. The proposed theory could have far-reaching impacts in the way such flows are approached by scientists and engineers, including new predictive models to enable simulations of engineering devices and natural processes that were impossible to do before. <br/>The main outcomes of this effort are expected to be a significant leap forward in first-principle modeling of turbulent liquid-gas flows, a new massive open online course (MOOC) on multiphase flows to maximize the educational impact to engineering students, and an iPad multiphase flow simulator to inspire students and the general public.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/><br/>While a significant body of work deals with fundamental stability of liquid-gas interfaces, a comprehensive mechanistic and statistical theory of turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows remains to be proposed, its development hindered by lack of experimental data and, at least until recently, inadequate numerical methods. The proposed work is centered upon unique, high fidelity numerical simulations of the interactions between turbulent eddies and active interfaces. The proposed work will not only lead to a new theory, but also to new large eddy simulation (LES) models that will be based on the concept of optimal estimators and on the transport equation for sub-grid scale kinetic energy. Such models can change the way engineers make predictions for such flows. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>Complex turbulent atomizing liquid-gas flows are ubiquitous in both nature and industrial applications, with relevance in climate modeling and oceanic transport, fire suppression, technical devices such as pumps, combustors, and pipelines, and applications such as fuel injection, nuclear cooling, hydropower, and concentrated solar power among many others. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which turbulence interfaces behave can lead to the design of safer and more efficient processes in these systems. The PI plans to make code developed in this project available to the scientific community, enabling research elsewhere. The educational activities of the proposed project will improve education and scientific literacy at different levels. A philosophy of ?accessibility of research? will be used to form and mentor two undergraduate students per year, chosen from under-represented minorities. The proposed multiphase turbulence theory will be integrated into a new graduate course on multiphase flow dynamics. To impact a larger number of engineering students, this course will be offered as a MOOC. Finally, an iPad app will be developed that exploits rapid and robust schemes for real-time computation and rendering of two-dimensional multiphase flows, providing a physics-based entertaining and educational application to inspire and educate middle school students about fluid dynamics science and engineering."
0.433186,"This award provides funding for the realization of a new technology for direct printing of low-profile ceramic sensors onto curved surfaces such as turbine blades. In the proposed process a liquid phase polymer precursor ink will be electrosprayed, cured, and pyrolyzed to yield a surface-conformed ceramic sensor element. To be amenable to printing, special consideration of the ink rheology and electrical conductivity is required. The research plan is a combination of experiments and modeling of the electrospray process with consideration of sensor functionality, device resolution and durability.<br/><br/>The research results could find broad use where surface conformance and low profile are needed for sensor applications in harsh environments such as power plants, nuclear reactors, coal mines and aircraft. The proposed printing method has the potential manufacturing advantages of being rapid and low-cost. The focus here will be on turbine blades and successful completion would enable real time, in situ thermal and mechanical measurements in turbines which operate at increasingly higher temperatures. Acquired data would enable enhanced engine control, health monitoring, and design optimization as well as contribute to improved efficiency and reliability during operation. Graduate students will be directly involved in the project and K-12 students will benefit from classroom demonstration of advanced printing process concepts."
0.703354,"An award is made to Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey in Newark for the Development of a Laser Based Benchtop Radiocarbon Analyzer, a system to be used for the detection of very small quantities of Carbon 14. Broader impacts of the instrument development project are varied and span many areas: drug metabolism analysis, carbon dating, and environmental monitoring are particularly important. In the pharmaceutical area, microdosing methodology where non-therapeutic trace doses of labeled drugs are used to safely obtain pharmacokinetic information on new drugs will benefit from the developed instrument which will lower costs, speed up drug trials and make new drugs safer. For environmental monitoring, because the analyzer can accommodate a continuous flow of carbon dioxide, continuous air or soil gas monitoring heretofore impossible will become feasible and allow more robust monitoring of fossil fuel carbon in the biosphere. Important to the instrument development project is outreach to a broad user community and to potential commercial partners. Using methodology learned in the NSF I-CORPS program this bridging development project will expedite commercialization of the instrument via private sector manufacturing, sales and service. The highly diverse student body at Rutgers in Newark will be exposed to the project which may influence their career decisions; and qualified students will participate in development projects. Technology transfer success will benefit the wider scientific enterprise by illustrating the value of fundamental physical research in solving societal problems. Government and private sector funding will be sought for technology transfer and broad scale commercialization.<br/><br/>The use of Radiocarbon or Carbon 14 (C-14) as a tracer is very widely accepted in many areas of science. Because it is a ""natural"" label of living systems it is often used for carbon dating of once living samples and also for tracing carbon in the atmosphere/biosphere system. Labeling with 14C is especially important in drug development and environmental studies as well as in basic research associated with metabolism. Traditional instrument systems to quantify C-14 still depend on the detection of a nuclear decay event, a highly inefficient process which requires the use of either high levels of radioactivity, large samples, long counting times, or some combination of each. Greatly enhanced sensitivity, now only possible with large centralized particle accelerator technology, is necessary for low dose and small sample tracer studies, for long-term metabolic studies, for drug dissemination studies and for environmental monitoring. The laser-based instrument to be developed in this project can provide the required high sensitivity, with the simplicity of radiation counting, in a benchtop analyzer capable of being used by a laboratory technician. Such high sensitivity will reduce the costs associated with drug metabolism studies and allow human tracer testing with little radiation exposure. Engineering, algorithm and calibration simplification will improve the precision and throughput allowing the widespread use and commercialization of the technology."

Support provides for continued production of the ISC Bulletin - the definitive global summary of earthquake hypocentres, magnitudes and source mechanisms, as well as station arrival times, amplitudes and other measurements with links to original waveforms where available. The international supported and non-governmental affiliation of the ISC allows the Centre to collect and freely distribute data from otherwise unavailable sources of global seismic recordings. The ISC Bulletin supports the global seismology community for fundamental research on Earth structure, earthquake physics and earthquake hazards mitigation. The Bulletin also aids in monitoring of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. <br/><br/>ISC data products, in particular the global catalog of observed arrival times, amplitudes, and associated meta data, are a starting point for fundamental studies of Earth structure and earthquake source mechanisms. Support under this grant will allow for continued development and refinement of seismic event parameters that are published in the ISC bulletin and available on line as well as new efforts to extend the catalog back in time to the 1900 (pre-digital seismic recordings) and to a lower magnitude threshold. The improved seismic event records will allow for improved understanding of historical global seismicity and lead to better models of Earth's interior structure, the later critical to identifying seismic event source mechanisms, magnitudes and locations that aid in comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty monitoring.

0.741706,"Intellectual Merit: Cells typically divide at a specific, predictable location. Positioning of the cell division plane in cytokinesis is a fundamental and universal cellular process that has broad relevance to cell morphogenesis, development, tissue architecture, and stem cells. The aims of this research are to determine the molecular mechanisms governing this process. This project utilizes the sea urchin embryo as a potent animal cell model for symmetric cell division. Cell division site determination involves multiple processes. The cell initially positions and orients the nucleus in late interphase along a reproducible axis relative to its cell shape. In this process, the nucleus must somehow sense the shape of the cell. The axis of the interphase nucleus sets the position of the spindle in mitosis, which then specifies the site of cleavage in cytokinesis. The project will focus on the mechanisms of how the nucleus is positioned, how cell shape is sensed, and how the spindle signals to the cortex to specify the division plane. The researchers have recently developed a powerful new approach to study the effect of cell geometry in a systematic manner by manipulating the shape of sea urchin cells by introducing them into micro-fabricated chambers of different shapes (such as rectangles, triangles, etc. The project will include live cell experiments focusing on the identifying the location of and specific molecular motor responsible for nuclear positioning coupled with computational modeling of how the division plane is determined in cells manipulated into different shapes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The researchers continue longstanding efforts to increase the diversity of scientists by broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in science. Efforts will be directed both in the laboratory and in national activities. The PI is a cell biologist who is also a Native American (Cherokee) who has a long record of involvement in working with a diverse pool of students and in national programmatic efforts. The researchers share a laboratory at the Marine Biology Laboratory, Woods Hole for about two months each summer where they host undergraduates (mostly from underrepresented groups) recruited nationally at the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) annual conference, from Boston College, and from the NSF funded REU summer program at the MBL. These students are mentored to participate in a number of activities whose aim is to better equip them, should they choose to pursue a scientific career. At the national level, the PI is continuing in a leadership role in programs whose goal is to increase the diversity of scientists including leading NSF supported efforts for SACNAS, for the American Society for Cell Biology and serving in a regular capacity to effect policy change, evaluate programs, and contribute to national activities by service to the AAAS, the NSF, and to colleges, universities and scientific societies."
0.403372,"Inferring evolutionary trees for closely related species remains a major obstacle to completing the Tree of Life. For example, evolutionary trees (phylogenies) of closely related animal species have generally relied on a single gene region - mitochondrial DNA.

However, these new ""species tree"" methods have not been rigorously compared. The project will use a well-studied bird genus (New World orioles, Icterus), as well as two poorly known genera from Australia (butcherbirds, Cracticus; red robins, Petroica) to compare the performance of species tree methods as applied to closely related species. <br/><br/>The project will train postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, and undergraduates in avian systematics, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses of genomic data.

0.6,"Proposal Number: 1402926<br/>P.I.: Perelman, Lev T.<br/>Title: Multispectral 3D Imaging of Pre-Cancer with PFC-LSS Angle-Resolved Technique<br/><br/>Significance:<br/><br/>Esophageal cancer is currently the fastest increasing cancer in the United States. Furthermore, the symptoms of esophageal cancer - including difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or choking - generally do not appear until advanced stages of the disease. Esophageal cancer develops almost exclusively in patients with Barrett's esophagus, an otherwise benign complication of esophageal reflux that affects approximately 3 million Americans. Although the prognosis of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer is poor, most esophageal cancers can be prevented if the disease is detected at an early dysplastic stage. Standard-of-care screening for dysplasia uses visual endoscopy and a prescribed pattern of biopsy. This procedure, in which a tiny fraction of the affected tissue is selected for pathological examination, has a low probability of detection because dysplasia is visually indistinguishable and affects only small portion of the esophagus. Our group has recently developed a new imaging method for detection of esophageal dysplasia which in its first clinical tests successfully detected invisible precancerous dysplasia in esophagus missed by the available clinical techniques. In its current form this method lacks depth information, an important factor in detecting and evaluating dysplasia and early cancers. Thus, in this application, we propose to add depth sensitivity to our method, providing an entirely new dimension to high resolution 3D imaging of pre-cancer. <br/><br/>We believe that this new imaging method offers great promise for the early detection of dysplasia in various organs. If this method were to be used routinely it would be of considerable significance and importance to the public, as the pre-cancer will be diagnosed at a much earlier, currently invisible, stage when it is still treatable, and lives will be saved.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The goal of this project is to combine endoscopic compatible scanning light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) described in our paper Qiu et al. Nature Medicine 2010, with the phase function corrected (PFC) diffusion method to develop quantitative depth sensitive imaging method for guiding biopsy in real time in esophagus. The endoscopic scanning LSS strategy is to scan the entire esophagus to obtain LSS information about every 2 mm location of the epithelial surface. The LSS relates the collected optical data to the underlying optical parameters of the epithelial cells, which includes, for example, the size distribution of epithelial cell nuclei and nuclear density, the important histological diagnostic criteria used to identify the dysplastic sites. In turn, the PFC method described in our Vitkin et al. Nature Commun. 2011 paper fixes the diffusion theory near the point-of-entry, the longstanding unsolved problem in radiative transport. It appears that the combination of endoscopic scanning LSS and PFC can result in a very promising depth resolved multispectral 3D imaging approach which can provide entirely new dimension for the multispectral high resolution transcutaneous imaging of early cancer. This new method, which can be called the multispectral imaging scanning PFC-LSS method, is proposed in this application. We will build a laboratory PFC-LSS imaging setup to test the ideas of depth resolved diagnostic imaging and, at the same time, develop a mathematical approaches capable of accurate description of both the depth resolved imaging and LSS information about epithelial tissues. After testing the laboratory setup on reproducible tissue phantoms and on freshly resected esophageal tissue we will modifying our existing endoscopic scanning LSS clinical instrument to incorporate a PFC-LSS capability for high resolution 3D imaging of epithelial sites suspicious for dysplasia. We will test the performance of the new endoscopic instrument in identifying high grade dysplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus undergoing routine surveillance endoscopy at the Interventional Endoscopy Center at BIDMC. The accuracy of the technique will be verified using clinically accepted methods of collecting biopsies from suspected areas (immediately after optical PFC-LSS data has been collected) and obtaining and comparing pathological analysis of these biopsies. We believe that PFC-LSS imaging offers great promise for the early detection of dysplasia in esophagus, and therefore unnecessary biopsies would be avoided and focal dysplastic spots would be biopsied that otherwise would be missed."
0.207132,"Among planetary bodies, Earth is unique in that it possesses an oxygen-rich atmosphere sustained by photosynthesis. Its mantle is also unusual in that it is oxidized relative to the mantles of other planetary bodies (e.g., Vesta, Mars). The redox evolution of the mantle may have influenced the redox state of the present atmosphere as the raise in the oxygen content of the atmosphere approximately two billion years ago could have resulted from a change in the nature of the gases emitted by volcanoes. One challenge with understanding what controlled the redox evolution of Earth is that proxies to trace the oxidation state of the mantle are missing or inadequate. One way to measure the redox state of the Earth is to study the redox state of iron, which can exist as metallic iron under reducing condition, ferrous iron (as in olivine) in intermediate condition, and ferric (as in rust) in oxidizing condition. One difficulty with this approach is that iron can easy switch from one form to another. For this reason, it is important to develop new tracers of the redox condition of the Earth's mantle that are less easily obliterated, and iron isotopes may be such tracers. However, the groundwork to establish iron isotopes as tracers of magmatic and redox processes in the Earth is still missing, which is the main scope of this proposal.<br/><br/>The extent to which iron isotopes can be fractionated in rocks and magmas can be predicted using the synchrotron method of Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (NRIXS), which allows measuring the strength of the bonds that hold iron in position in a solid (the mean force constant of iron bonds). Through theory, it is possible to predict the extent to which iron isotopes can be fractionated based on such NRIXS measurements. Previous work showed that there was a strong influence of the redox state of iron and magma composition on the degree of iron isotopic fractionation. These studies could explain why more evolved (more silicic) igneous rocks tend to have heavier Fe isotopic compositions than less silicic rocks. They however fell short of explaining why the oceanic crust is enriched systematically in the heavy isotopes of iron relative to the underlying mantle. One possible reason for this shortcoming is that the samples that are usually measured by NRIXS at room temperature for practical reasons are not representative of mantle-derived samples, which are at much higher temperatures. Indeed, higher temperatures could affect the structure of the samples. It could also affect the strength of the chemical bonds if the material shows some anharmonicity. To quantify this, experiments will be done at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron to measure the force constant of iron bonds of materials of geological relevance (glasses, melts, olivine) at high temperature. This will be done by placing the samples on a heated wire in a controlled atmosphere and bringing the detectors as close as possible to the samples without damaging them. By measuring the apparent force constant of iron bonds as a function of temperature, it will be possible to retrieve the quartic term of the interatomic potential and learn about anharmonic and structural changes in igneous rocks and melts. These measurements will help develop a quantitative understanding of iron isotopic fractionation in mantle and crustal rocks. This is needed to use iron isotopic variations in igneous rocks as tracers of the redox state and magmatic evolution of the Earth."

0.435728,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Biological materials often feature complex assemblies that utilize the interaction between phases possessing disparate mechanical properties to achieve synergistic and highly tunable effects. Incorporation of this nature-inspired structural interplay into synthetic polymeric systems is proposed toward the development of mechanically-robust and functional materials. Their structures and properties will be studied and correlated in this project using a combination of advanced instrumentation. The ability to control and tune the molecular and materials architecture in complex systems addresses key scientific challenges related to mechanically adaptive behavior and controlled transport in new materials development. Such systems have potential use in a range of applications, including biomedical delivery vehicles, sensors, actuators, and membranes, and may potentially also offer advantages in terms of processability. <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will gain exposure to cross-cutting research -- from synthesis to processing -- and utilize these advances in the areas of mentorship and community outreach. A mentoring platform for female students and post-docs, particularly from underrepresented groups, to engage in dialogue regarding shared experiences and career pathways will be supported. An expanded partnership with a K-12 all-female independent school will provide hands-on demonstrations, career development, and safety/ethics training during a two-week science/engineering exposure program for high-school girls. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Supramolecular associations have been widely explored in elastomers, blends, and copolymer systems, and have motivated interest in the utilization of dynamic associations in the design of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs). IPNs provide a robust platform to explore the role of supramolecular motifs as a toughening mechanism due to the intimate interaction of the polymer phases. This research program will elucidate structural parameters and guiding principles to direct fabrication of supramolecular IPNs with tunable interfacial interactions, tailored structural heterogeneity, and synergistic mechanical behavior. Three classes of supramolecular IPNs will be explored that utilize: (1) complementary and orthogonal supramolecular associations with focus on how motifs of varying interaction strength/organization influence microstructure development and dynamics, (2) self-complementary and complementary hydrogen bonding associations with an emphasis on the correlation between the resulting IPN morphology, mechanics, and supramolecular response, and (3) particulate-reinforcement as an approach to control phase coarsening, mechanical behavior, and functionality. A full suite of structural, thermal, mechanical, and morphological characterization techniques will be utilized, including variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy, tensile testing, dynamic mechanical analysis, atomic force microscopy, rheology, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering."

The research focuses on the assessment of infrastructure integrity or Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using cutting-edge technologies in Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE). The IITM houses an NDE Center with state-of-the art facilities for research using advanced ultrasonic, electro-magnetic, radiography, thermal and optical tools that will be available to MSU graduate and undergraduate students to conduct hypotheses-driven, multidisciplinary research in NDE.<br/><br/>NDE techniques are used to inspect and assess the structural integrity of a variety of systems such as nuclear power plants, natural gas pipelines, aircraft, bridges, dams and other segments of the civilian and defense infrastructure. As many of these are known to have far exceeded their designed lifetime, there is increasing demand for reliable and accurate assessments of their structural integrity. Monitoring is accomplished using a variety of modalities that rely on different energy sources such as electromagnetic, ultrasound, thermal, and x-ray. The underlying physics of each inspection technology is diverse as are the methods for analyzing the data. Consequently, NDE provides a rich area for student research that will focus on novel developments in computational modeling, signal processing, machine learning algorithms for solving the inverse problem, and development of novel NDE sensors and systems. Projects in multiple NDE modalities of mutual interest to MSU and IITM will be selected with the goal of developing new technologies. <br/><br/>This award offers opportunities for US students to work in an international research environment in collaboration with leading Indian scientists. They will also have access to the research laboratories of General Electric and General Motors in Bangalore, where they will learn about global operations of US companies and the advantages of international collaboration. This project will attract high caliber domestic students who will be encouraged to do graduate studies and doctoral degrees. Special outreach will be made to recruit minority and underrepresented students thru MSU and national programs. A number of student theses and dissertations are anticipated from these projects plus numerous journal articles and joint presentations at scientific meetings and conferences. This experience will expand students? academic horizons and encourage engagement in global collaboration."

0.327191,"This award will enable Professor Edward Cackett at Wayne State University to analyze archival X-ray data and carry out new observations of low-mass X-ray binaries. He will use both timing and spectral information to probe the kinematics and geometry of the inner regions of accretion disks. His procedure involves modeling the reverberation of emission from a corona or boundary layer as it reflects off the inner accretion disk. Models of this process will be constrained by the spectral-dependent time lag of two emission components. The PI has been a key player in applying these techniques to active galactic nuclei and stellar-mass black-hole accretion, and he will extend this work to neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.<br/><br/>Neutron stars provide the only way to probe fundamental questions regarding the behavior of matter under the most extreme conditions, with densities at their center being many times nuclear density. This award will facilitate a better measurement of the radius of neutron stars, and it will use neutron stars with low-mass companions as laboratories to study the physical process of accretion, which happens in a wide range of astrophysical contexts. Professor Cackett is actively building an integrated research and education program at Wayne State University. As part of this award, he will develop a program to provide solar telescopes to metropolitan Detroit area high schools to add a hands-on daytime observing aspect to their science curricula. To multiply the effectiveness, he will conduct workshops for high-school teachers and provide sample curricular materials and independent research projects. These workshops will also include a review of all astronomy topics in the high school science standards, with a particular focus on contemporary topics of interest that are associated with the original and creative research funded by this award."
0.42,"The goal of this project is to investigate strongly interacting ultracold atoms and molecules. The PI will study novel few-body states and search for new exact results for the many-body systems. Most results will be very quantitative and free from uncontrolled approximations. There are a number of topics which will be studied, including three- and five-body Efimov states, states where the atom is constrained in one or more dimensions, for example near a surface, and atomic or molecular states near a Feshbach resonance. In addition, the PI will derive exact relations for strongly interacting Fermi gases and density profiles for quantum gases near a wall.<br/><br/>With the advance of technology, mankind can now actively manipulate the microscopic world. It is particularly useful to cool atoms and molecules to temperatures that are billions of times closer to absolute zero than the background of the universe. High precision atomic clocks, for example, are only possible with sufficiently cold atoms. In order to study these systems, one must solve the Schrdinger equation, which is challenging even for just a few atoms. In many cases, the lack of an adequate solution has hampered the understanding of the behaviors of ultracold atoms and molecules. The new research directions in this project will provide a guide for the ongoing experiments on ultracold atoms and molecules. Because of the quantum similarity between cold atoms and other particles, such as electrons in solid state materials and protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei (they all satisfy the Schrdinger equation), theoretical research of ultracold atoms and molecules may also shed new light on material science and nuclear science. The PI plans to integrate his research and educational activities by creating a special topics course on Few-Body Quantum Physics and training doctoral students who will learn advanced scientific and mathematical techniques."
0.18,"Atoms that interact strongly at low energy exhibit universal behavior that does not depend on details of atomic physics.

0.5,"Abstract<br/><br/>PI: Joel L. Kaar<br/>Proposal #: 1454379<br/>Institution: University of Colorado at Boulder<br/><br/>The use of various renewable biomass materials as an alternate source of energy is an important focus of research today. Cellulose is an organic compound, a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to many thousands of linked D-glucose units. Cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of among others, green plants and many forms of algae. For example, the cellulose content of wood is 40 to 50%. Cellulase is any of several enzymes produced chiefly by fungi, bacteria, and protozoans that catalyze cellulolysis, the decomposition of cellulose and of some related polysaccharides. Cellulases break down the cellulose molecule into monosaccharides (""simple sugars"") such as beta-glucose, or shorter polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. The emergence of ionic liquids (ILs - salt-like substances that melt at ambient temperature) as alternative solvents for the dissolution of biomass presents considerable opportunities for the conversion of cellulosic materials. Of particular interest, with the appropriate selection of cation and anion, ILs can be rationally tuned to dissolve high concentrations of untreated crystalline cellulose. The formation of hydrogen bonds between the IL and cellulose disrupts the internal hydrogen bonding network that causes cellulose chains to pack tightly together. In addition to lowering the degree of crystallinity of cellulose, select ILs can loosen the matrix components within biomass that add to the overall recalcitrance of cellulose. Furthermore, due to the thermal stability and non-volatile nature of ILs, ILs constitute and environmentally attractive solution to the need for cleaner media for cellulose processing. Conventional solvents used to dissolve cellulose, which contain inorganic salts, acids, bases, and metal complexes, are largely toxic and environmentally polluting. However, the attractive properties of ILs are negated by the broad inactivation of cellulases in these solvents. Consequently, for ILs to be fully exploited for processing whole biomass, the solvent effects of ILs on cellulases needs to be mediated.<br/><br/>The aim of this integrated research and teaching project is to develop an approach to enhance the tolerance of cellulases to ionic liquids (ILs) for biomass processing via engineering enzyme charge. The research will specifically test the hypothesis that changing the surface charge of cellulases by site-directed mutagenesis can mediate interactions with ILs, which impact cellulase stability. As solvents for cellulosic materials, ILs present considerable opportunities due to their auspicious properties, including the unique capacity to solubilize large amounts of biomass. In this project, the impact of altering enzyme charge on the denaturation of cellulase by ILs will be directly probed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with unprecedented resolution. This impact will be investigated while using site-directed mutagenesis to alter the charge of the well-characterized endoglucanase EI from Acidothermus cellulolyticus, exoglucanase CbhA from Clostridium thermocellum, and beta-glucosidase JMB19063 GH3. Additionally, the role of surface electrostatics on the prevention of cellulase inhibition by insoluble matrix components in the conversion of whole biomass will be elucidated. The specific research objectives are to: 1) identify sites in EI, CbhA, and GH3 that are structurally perturbed by ILs by NMR and MD, 2) rationally design and test EI, CbhA, and GH3 variants with altered surface charge for improved tolerance to IL-induced inactivation, and 3) characterize the effect of site-directed charge mutations on non-productive lignin adsorption to EI, CbhA, and GH3. The educational objectives are to: 1) promote research opportunities for local high school students through involvement in Boulder Valley School District Research Seminar Program, 2) create opportunities for undergraduate research via growth of iGEM program, and 3) create and implement laboratory modules on biocatalysis for undergraduate curriculum."
0.404999,"The mineralogy of the Earth's lower mantle, which comprises the largest fraction of our planet (>55% by volume), was previously regarded as simple and monotonous. An iron-magnesium silicate with the perovskite structure was thought to be the stable mineral unchanging over the enormous pressure and depth range some 400 to 1,800 miles (660 to 2,900 kilometers) below the Earth's surface. With prior NSF grant support, the PI's team made a surprising discovery: at the conditions of the deep lower mantle, the iron-magnesium silicate decomposes into a pure magnesium silicate and a previously unknown Fe-rich silicate mineral with entirely new properties. The next challenge in the present grant is, therefore, to investigate how the new minerals respond to seismic waves and how they deform under compression. The team will use a battery of novel probes for characterization of these properties in-situ under the high pressures and temperatures generated in their laboratory. The results will provide the key for deciphering the seismological information and gain fundamental understanding of the deep Earth interior.<br/><br/>Focused research on the frontier of the deep lower mantle is proposed. Very recently, the perovskite phase of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 was found to disproportionate to an Fe-free MgSiO3 pv and a new Fe-rich hexagonal silicate (H-phase) at the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions corresponding to the bottom ~1000 km, representing an important, surprising discovery. In the present proposal, the observation of disproportionation and H phase will be further explored and their exact P-T boundaries and physical properties will be investigated. The newly developed multigrain crystallography technique will be applied to P-V-T-x studies in the multiphase region that perovskite, H-phase, and/or post-perovskite coexist. Synchrotron Mssbauer spectroscopy, x-ray emission spectroscopy, and nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering will be used to probe the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio, spin state, and phonon density of state, respectively, for the H-phase in-situ under high P-T. Radial x-ray diffraction and the newly developed Bragg coherent diffraction imaging method will be developed to study lattice preferred orientation and shape-preferred orientation as possible sources of seismic anisotropy in the D"" layer. Results from the present study will contribute to fundamental understanding the seismic complexities of the deep lower mantle."

0.28357,"How is biodiversity generated and maintained? Much evidence suggests that parasites play an important role in both the origin and the maintenance of biological diversity. This project focuses on one of the most diverse groups of organisms on the planet: herbivorous insects, their parasites, and their microbes. The project targets three economically important groups of organisms: plants in the pumpkin/cucumber family, true fruit flies that attack these plants, and parasitic wasps that kill the flies. These wasps belong to a highly diverse and little studied group of species. Each wasp species can kill only one fly species; wasps attacking the ""wrong"" species of fly die. These bi-directional lethal interactions may be mediated by microbes (in wasps, flies, or both), by traits of flies' immune systems, or both. This project is designed to uncover the mechanisms (evolutionary, ecological, and immunological) affecting interactions that may help explain the diversity of life. Many species of true fruit flies are major agricultural pests; this project will greatly increase knowledge about factors contributing to their susceptibility to parasitoids. <br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses that predict that: 1) defenses of parasites and their hosts affect diversification rates; 2) mechanisms of virulence differ among lineages, and 3) selection arising from predator-prey interactions can affect rates of species-formation. To discover and identify mechanisms of diversification, participants will generate and analyze molecular 1) high-resolution genetic data, multiple nuclear loci, and mtCOI haplotypes to delineate species, and resolve deeper phylogenetic relationships; 2) microsatellites and ddRAD-seq markers to discover and quantify fine-scale genetic diversity within and among populations; 3) phylogenies and field experiments to test hypotheses about mechanisms generating and controlling diversity on ancient, recent, and contemporary timescales.

0.81248,"Technical Description: This proposal is based on the idea that it may be possible to realize key structural and functional aspects of subcellular organization due to the physicochemical phenomena that arise in solutions that are crowded with macromolecules ""like the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are"" even in the absence of specific biomolecular interactions. Of particular interest is aqueous phase separation, which commonly occurs in polymer solutions and offers a means of compartmentalization. This work will evaluate two hypotheses: (1) that phase separation in the crowded intracellular environment could be largely responsible for the existence and properties of non-membranous organelles, and (2) that these structures could in turn serve as templates for membrane assembly. Experimental models of subcellular cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments will be developed based on crowded solutions of RNA, polyamines, proteins, and neutral polymers. Protein phosphorylation will be used to drive formation and disassembly of microcompartments that will serve as model organelles. Three research objectives are proposed: (1) Dynamic assembly/disassembly of model non-membranous organelles based on aqueous phase compartments that form in response to protein phosphorylation state. (2) Templated membrane formation around these model organelles. (3) Primitive model for mitosis/cell cycle in cell-sized lipid vesicles that contain the crowded solution and phase compartment-based model organelles. <br/><br/>Nontechnical Description: Intracellular organization is a hallmark of living cells, with both membrane-bounded (e.g., nucleus) and non-membranous organelles (e.g., nucleolus, P-granules) performing key cellular functions. The central questions driving these investigations are: What role do relatively nonspecific chemical and physical effects play in subcellular organization and the associated functions of biological cells, and how does complexity arise from a small number of simple molecular components? The investigators hypothesize that, despite the deliberate simplicity of the proposed model cells, they will be able to mimic complex biological processes and specific biochemical interactions, such as the reversible formation and dissolution of RNA and protein-rich compartments, the formation of interior membranes around pre-existing protein-rich compartments, and finally to model cell division in a very primitive mimic of the mitotic cell. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Two graduate students will be trained at the interface of molecular and cell biology, chemistry, biophysics and materials science. Undergraduate students will be recruited to work on this project during the academic year for course credit and in the summer through the various on-site REU programs, with a target of one student during the academic year and one or two students during the summer. Support for one K-12 teacher each summer is included in the budget. The investigators will team with the existing Research Experiences for Teachers program in the PSU MRSEC. Teachers will perform experiments and develop curriculum materials to bring back to their own classrooms the following school year. Real-world examples go beyond the intracellular organelles that motivate the intellectual merit of this proposal to also include, e.g., food science, drug delivery, and environmental remediation.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in MCB/BIO and co-funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in CHE/MPS."

0.220689,"Nontechnical Description<br/>Catastrophic events such as Fukushima and Katrina have made it clear that integrating physical and social causes of failure into a cohesive modeling framework is critical in order to prevent complex technological accidents and to maintain public safety and health. In this research, experts in Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), Organizational Behavior and Information Science and Data Analytics disciplines will collaborate to provide answers to the following key questions: (a) what social and organizational factors affect technical system risk? (b) how and why do these factors influence risk? and (c) how much do they contribute to risk? Existing PRA models do not include a complete range of organizational factors. This research investigates organizational root causes of failure and models their paths of influence on technical system performance, resulting in more comprehensive incorporation of underlying organizational failure mechanisms into PRA. The field of PRA has progressed the quantification of equipment failure and human error for modeling risk of complex systems; however, the current organizational risk contributors lack reliable data analytics that go beyond safety climate and safety culture surveys. This research fills that gap by developing predictive causal modeling and big-data theoretic technologies for PRA, expanding the classic approach of data management for risk analysis by utilizing techniques such as text mining, data mining and data analytics. In addition to scientific contributions to organizational science, PRA, and data analytics, this research provides regulatory and industry decision-makers with important organizational factors that contribute to risk and leads to optimized decision making. Other applications include real-time monitoring of organizational safety indicators, efficient safety auditing, in-depth root cause analysis, and risk-informed emergency preparedness, planning and response. The multidisciplinary approach of this project can serve as an educational model, empowering students to pursue research across disciplinary boundaries. Finally, the proposed research represents a successful model of industry-academia collaboration. A nuclear power plant has committed to this project and provides unique access to data and information necessary to complete the research. The proposed methodology is generic and applicable for any high-risk industry (e.g., aviation, healthcare, oil and gas), and will be used for the improvement of organizational safety performance in order to protect workers, the public and the environment. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Organizations produce, process and store a large volume of wide-ranging, unstructured data as a result of business activities and compliance requirements (i.e., corrective action programs, root cause analysis reports, oversight and inspection data, etc.). This research leverages those data resources for the quantification of organizational failure mechanisms and their integration with the technical system risk scenarios generated by PRA. The research is based on a socio-technical risk theory to prevent misleading results from solely data-informed approaches. Combining socio-technical risk theory, systematic modeling and semantic data analytics strategies will greatly enhance risk analysis of complex systems. We will conduct our research based on following steps: (1) Expand factors, sub-factors, and causal relationships in the Socio-Technical Risk Analysis (SoTeRiA) framework, (2) Develop measurement techniques for factors, sub-factors and their causal relationships in SoTeRiA (e.g., integrating text mining with the Bayesian Belief Network; conducting scientific reduction to identify important factors; measuring of important factors), (3) Establish a dynamic, predictive socio-technical causal modeling technique, (4) Perform uncertainty analysis, (5) Conduct verification and validation, (6) Integrate the quantitative socio-technical causal model with PRA, and (7) Conduct sensitivity and importance measure analyses. As the pioneer study on the integration of big data with PRA, this research addresses and quantifies risk emerging from the interface of social and technical systems."

Dr. Walls is developing an alternative ""multidimensional"" approach that generates signal in a single experiment. The method is based upon correlations between spin transitions rather than individual spin transition frequencies, and may help speed up structural and dynamical NMR studies of biomolecular and other systems, and reduce MRI imaging times. It may also prove applicable to other spectroscopies and disciplines.<br/><br/>In the course of training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers, Dr. Walls is developing a new imaging and spectroscopy lab that uses NMR to illustrate the importance of numerical simulations in experimental science. Working with his undergraduate and graduate students, Dr. Walls is also developing a weekly science radio program, La Semana en Ciencia (The Week in Science), that will be produced in both English and Spanish at the UM School of Communication's radio studio. The program will highlight the excitement and importance of new scientific discoveries, with aims of enhancing science literacy and inspiring students to consider careers in science.

0.271877,"Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>A complex array of photoreceptors coordinates the response of organisms to their surrounding light environment. One influential set is the phytochromes (Phys), a large and diverse group of photoreversible chromoproteins that use a bilin pigment for light detection. These dimeric biliproteins sense red (R) and far-red light (FR) through two relatively stable conformational states, an R-absorbing Pr form that typically represents the ground state, and an FR-absorbing Pfr form that typically represents the activated state. By photointerconverting between Pr and Pfr, Phys act as light-regulated switches. Despite their agricultural and pathological importance and evolutionary conservation, it is not fully understood at the molecular level how Phy-type photoreceptors photoconvert between Pr and Pfr nor how this switch reports to organisms about the light around them. In the past few years, major breakthroughs have been made in understanding how Phys work at the atomic level through the determination of 3-D structural models of the photosensing module from several microbial representatives. These structures revealed the configuration of the bilin pigment and how it is cradled within its binding pocket, identified a likely route whereby plant Phys evolved from bacterial progenitors, and identified several unique structural features likely critical to signaling. During prior NSF-funded studies, the first paired ground and photoactivated state structures of the chromophore pocket from two divergent Phys were generated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Comparisons of these structures provided the first glimpse into how light triggers light perception. Included are light-driven rotation of the bilin followed by rearrangement of numerous chromophore/amino acid contacts. Ultimately, these alterations must convert light energy into mechanical motion that reorganizes the output module and affect its signaling potential. This project will build upon these structural studies to answer key questions. What is the structure of a complete Phy dimer? How does rotation of the bilin followed by structural changes within the binding pocket alter Phy signaling? What is the structure of a plant Phy and how can this information be used to engineer Phy signaling for agricultural benefit? Significant to this work are the development of recombinant systems that produce large amounts of assembled photoreceptors and advances that have culminated in the generation of diffraction quality crystals of a plant Phy. Specifically, this research plan will: (1) develop more complete structures of a microbial Phy with its signal output module, (2) define how the knot, spine, and hairpin features contribute to Phy signaling, (3) determine how the distinctive cyanobacteriochrome subfamily uniquely detects other portions of the light spectrum, (4) generate an X-ray crystallographic structure of the photosensing module of a plant Phy, and (5) use a combination of NMR spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and single particle electron microscopic approaches to generate models of a complete plant Phy dimer with and without signaling partners. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>This research will provide an essential framework to better understand the structure, function, and evolution of the Phy superfamily. The anticipated results will ultimately help elucidate how microorganisms and plants sense their light environment, which could have important ramifications for understanding microbial ecosystems, the control of important microbial pathogens, and for the development of new strategies to improve the productivity of food and biofuel crops. In addition, the project will enhance scientific infrastructure via a cooperative arrangement for the training of postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and minority students in modern molecular and structure-based approaches in biological research. Training will also involve high school students sponsored by the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship Program."
0.8908,"Project title: Conformational flexibility in Beclin 1, an evolutionarily-conserved, key autophagy protein<br/><br/>Autophagy is a critical cell survival pathway responsible for nutrient recycling due to degradation of unwanted, damaged or harmful cellular components. Autophagy plays an important role in several key organismal processes including embryonic development, tissue differentiation, cell-growth, as well as surviving environmental stress and internal stressors like damaged organelles, mutant proteins, free radicals and intracellular pathogens. Beclin1, a protein essential for autophagy, has been directly implicated in these processes. This research will focus on understanding the atomic-resolution structure and flexibility of Beclin1 to provide a better understanding of its critical role in autophagy and cellular maintenance. This project will provide graduate and undergraduate students in North Dakota an unprecedented opportunity to train in classical and cutting edge methods of biophysical and biochemical research, and also have a substantial impact outside the laboratory by educating high-school teachers about biomacromolecular structure and function. Over the period of this project, 40 high-school science teachers will participate in a summer professional development course to help them instruct their students in understanding the structures of biomacromolecules such as proteins and DNA. Thus, the educational activities outlined in this project are designed to educate and mentor students at all levels: high school, undergraduate and graduate; and will have a broader impact far beyond the grant funding period.<br/><br/>Beclin1 appears to be a protein interaction hub for autophagy as it binds to over twenty diverse cellular proteins. The research goal of this project is to better understand how Beclin 1 interacts with so many different partners by establishing its structure and conformational flexibility and identifying residues that are key for function. Circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to assess secondary structure content, backbone flexibility and dynamic conformational changes. High-resolution structures will be determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR. Small-angle X-ray scattering will be used to obtain low-resolution structural information such as size, oligomerization and molecular envelopes. Combined information from these methods will be used to derive a pseudo-atomic model of full-length Beclin1. The role of motifs and conserved residues in binding will be examined using isothermal titration calorimetry to quantify the thermodynamics of interaction and by cellular assays to assess the impact of mutations on cellular autophagy levels and binding of selected key autophagy proteins. Last, but not least, this research will provide substantial information about poorly understood intrinsically disordered regions and help establish methodology essential for investigating such regions."

These nanogels are a new material with unprecedented ability to separate mixtures of complex biomolecules. The full range of applications for this material will be characterized by determining the fluidic properties of the material under different conditions and by recording the separation performance for standard sets of biopolymers including DNA, peptides, proteins, and carbohydrates. The technology to be developed will directly affect research in many fields that rely on electrophoretic and micro-scale separation based assays to identify the biomolecule present in the sample as well as the concentration. The research indirectly influences other fields utilizing phospholipids for structural analyses by nuclear magnetic resonance, as biomimetic coatings, as templates for fabrication, and for the investigation of membrane protein function. Finally, self-assembled phospholipid nanogels serve as a model smart-material for which the material properties change under different environmental conditions. <br/><br/>The teaching, training, and learning fostered under this award lead to valuable support of human resources.

In addition, micro-flow systems in the form of microfluidic devices will be adapted for the middle school science classroom. Science education at this level benefits young students as they begin the process of career identity. Lessons will be developed that align with teaching objectives to support the science curricula.

0.314574,"Natural fractures act as major heterogeneities in the subsurface that controls flow and transport of subsurface fluids and chemical species. Their importance cannot be underestimated, because their transmissivity may result in undesired migration during geologic sequestration of CO2, they strongly control heat recovery from geothermal reservoirs, and they may lead to induced seismicity due to fluid injection into the subsurface. Advanced computational methods are critical to design subsurface processes in fractured media for successful environmental and energy applications. This project will address the following key BIG data and computer science challenges: (1) Computation of seismic wave propagation in fractured media; (2) BIG DATA analytics for inferring fracture characteristics; (3) High Performance Computation of flow and transport in fractured media; and (4) Integration of data from disparate sources for risk assessment and decision-making. This will enable design of technologies for addressing key societal issues such as safe energy extraction from the surface, long-term sequestration of large volumes of greenhouse gases, and safe storage of nuclear waste. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a team of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Outreach to high schools teachers and minorities through a planned workshop will inspire interest in environmental green-engineering, mathematics, and computational science. Numerous applications will benefit from this research, including Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Geosciences (GEO), and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will emphasize high performance computation (HPC) approaches for characterizing fractures using large subsurface seismic data sets, BIG data analytics for extraction of fracture related information from seismic inversion results and long-duration dynamic data, and advanced computational approaches for modeling flow, transport, and geomechanics in fractured subsurface systems.

0.297321,"Solid state electronic devices such as diodes and transistors used in cell phones, computers, and light emitting diodes (LEDs) require materials of the highest perfection. They must be close to flawless and have low impurity concentrations in order for the device to function properly. Under this award, a method of producing single crystals of a new electronic material, hexagonal boron nitride, with high perfection will be developed. Currently, this material is only available as a powder, but much larger crystals are necessary for many applications. In this research program, hexagonal boron nitride crystals will be produced from a molten metal solution as it is cooled from a high temperature. The effect of parameters such as the solution's maximum temperature and cooling rate on the size and perfection of the crystals will be determined. High quality hexagonal boron nitride single crystals are expected to enable new types of electronic devices, such as ultraviolet light emitting diodes for water purification and sterilizing medical equipment, flexible electronics, and radiation sensors for interdicting materials to make nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>The processing parameters that affect the size and quality of hexagonal boron nitride single crystals precipitated from a molten nickel-chromium solvent will be examined by the statistical response surface methodology. Solution growth was selected due to its relatively low temperature (<1600 C) and pressure (< 1 atmosphere) requirements. The boron and nitrogen concentrations, the maximum temperature of the solution, and the solution cooling rate are expected to be important parameters. The concentrations and distributions of boron and nitrogen (as pairs or isolated elements) in the solution will be measured as a function of temperature. The impact of temperature and supersaturation on the crystal's growth rate, area, thickness, habit, surface morphology, and dislocation types and densities will be determined by a combination of optical and electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and compositional analysis. The influence of impurities (specifically oxygen and carbon) on the growth rate anisotropy and crystal habit will also be examined. This investigation will establish the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic parameters that are most important for controlling the size and quality of hexagonal boron nitride single crystals so the process can be optimized. It will support the education of a PhD student and will provide high quality materials to other researchers to investigate hexagonal boron nitride's optical, electrical, and mechanical properties and applications."
0.290965,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Advanced technical glasses are key in many areas of our lives, and although glass is rightly perceived as a robust material, it is nevertheless subject to corrosion due to interaction with water and the environment thereby limiting the functionality of this highly versatile material. A deeper understanding of glass corrosion is thus highly relevant to industry in the development of technical glasses, in enabling applications such as nuclear waste management, and in developing novel biomaterials. This project aims at understanding the fundamental science governing corrosion of multicomponent silicate glasses with mixed glass formers in aqueous solutions, achieved through an integrated combination of experimental studies and computer simulation approaches. Successful completion of this project is expected to lay the foundation of new fundamental knowledge for the understanding of composition-structure-property relationships in glass corrosion, with tangible implications on the glass and packaging industries. By training undergraduate and graduate students in glass science and engineering, the lacuna of talent in the pipeline for the US glass/materials science industry is being reduced. Students in this project are receiving part of their training at Corning, Incorporated, a company specializing in technical glass materials, or in a European research environment. The education activities build interest in students at the middle and high school level, in addition to the training of undergraduate and graduate science and engineering students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: While glass corrosion has been studied for a long time, it is riddled with complexity that makes a holistic understanding deceptively difficult. The current understanding in this field is based primarily on empirical data, and there is still no complete consensus on the basic mechanism of glass dissolution that applies to a wide composition space. Therefore, there is exigent need to develop solid fundamental understanding of the connection between chemical composition, atomic/molecular structure and chemical durability of glasses in order to address crucial and scientifically challenging problems. Accordingly, the project aims at combining the strengths of experimental studies and atomistic computer simulations to understand the connection between composition, molecular structure, and dissolution behavior of SiO2-rich multicomponent oxide glasses comprising multiple network forming oxides (B2O3, Al2O3, P2O5). The general focus on silicate systems helps to connect with real-world multicomponent glasses, and provides a suitable platform for (some) known structural trends to connect with durability properties. The project is expected to unearth the fundamental science governing the corrosion of glasses and deliver experimental data along with structural descriptors and energy functions that can be used to develop theoretical models predicting the chemical durability of glasses."
0.382365,"The investigators will study an important class of massive stars, which have bright eruptions of material from their surface. These stars are in the last stages of their stellar life cycle, sometimes just before stellar explosions as supernovae (SNe). The investigators will use telescopes of the University of Arizona to study Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars. They will study the material ejected around nearby LBVs and the connection between SNe brightnesses. The material from the LBVs appears as bright rings of gas surrounding the stars. The material is visible in observations with optical telescopes and sensitive cameras. These observations provide the only way to measure the ejected mass and speed, as well as the typical time period between large eruptions. The investigators will study the environments of LBVs in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. <br/><br/>The investigator will mentor in CAMPARE, a program that fosters diversity in science by recruiting minorities and statistically underrepresented groups for a summer undergraduate research experience at Steward Observatory. The investigator will continue as a Sky Ambassador, working with Tucson elementary and high-school science teachers. As part of this program, they will develop instructional materials concerning the Sun and stars, supernovae, and the origin of the elements. There research program will also fund one Ph.D. thesis and several undergraduate researchers, providing them with experience with complex multi-wavelength observational data and time-variable phenomena. <br/><br/>The investigators focus on observations to understand the stellar life cycle and explosive deaths of massive stars, since SNe dominate feedback in galaxies. SNe enrich the interstellar medium with elements, and they can be used probe conditions in the distant universe. The use of SNe to estimate of distances to galaxies hinges upon understanding the connection between massive stars and the various types of SNe they produce. Eruptive mass loss is influential in stellar evolution, and violent eruptions preceding core collapse can lead to some of the most luminous SNe known. <br/><br/>This LBV/SNe connection was initially controversial because stellar models place massive LBVs in an earlier phase, but recently a dramatic confirmation of the connection between LBV stars and SNe was observed. In 2009 an LBV star was noted in a survey of massive stars, and then in 2012 this star became a core-collapse SNe. LBV-like eruptions may hold critical clues about stellar instability during the final phases of nuclear burning, vital to understanding core collapse. <br/><br/>During these studies, the investigators will detect a large number of extragalactic transients, and constrain the luminosity, mass-loss rates, duration, and outflow speed of the eruptions. Some of these eruptive transients will soon explode as SNe, so the observations will have tremendous value for understanding the prelude to core collapse of massive stars."
0.207106,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports fundamental theoretical research and education to understand how electron spin behaves in materials contributing to the foundations of possible future electronic devices which function by manipulating electron spin as well as its charge. In addition to carrying an electric charge, an electron is also in a sense like a spinning top that behaves according to the rules of quantum mechanics. There are two senses of spin to an electron and it is natural to explore using the electron to physically represent information, like the familiar '0' and '1' in digital electronics. Spintronics research aims to introduce the quantum mechanical spin into electronic devices by making use of the interactions between the electron spin and its environment in a material. Because charge-based field effect transistors are rapidly approaching their physical limits, the spin-charge computation scheme has recently become an active research frontier.<br/>The PI will develop theoretical models that quantify spin transport in materials that include silicon and elements vertically above and below silicon in the periodic table of elements. The PI will also investigate crystals that are essentially a single layer of atoms such as transition-metal dichalcogenides which are made of atoms from the transition-metal block of the periodic table and elements from the periodic table vertically below oxygen. This modeling is aimed to enable the design of spintronic devices in which the time needed for manipulating and processing information is prolonged by strain engineering and proper application of external electric fields. The primary research focus will be on quantifying this spin relaxation time in doped materials where the conductivity is improved either by intentionally adding foreign atoms that donate/accept electrons to/from the host crystal, or by applying a gate-voltage that brings charge carriers into atomically thin materials from surrounding materials. <br/>This project presents ideas that are fascinating to a wide range of students. Through collaboration of materials science, physics and engineering graduate students, each learns from the other concepts of quantum mechanics or device function. The PI will actively promote this research among K-12 students by delivering interactive lectures/demos that highlight the use of future technology in devices. The PI aims to utilize the potential of this research for societal impact to help attract students from under-represented groups to the project.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Understanding of the interactions between the electron's spin and its solid-state environment in metallic material systems has spurred immense development in information storage technologies. Contrary to metals, silicon holds complete sway over logic circuits. Fortunately, this and other group IV materials are promising candidates for spintronic logic devices owing to their crystalline inversion symmetry which suppresses precession of spins about randomly changing intrinsic magnetic fields, and the zero nuclear spin of their naturally abundant isotopes which suppresses spin relaxation by hyperfine interactions. <br/>A major objective in this project will be to fill a longstanding gap in the theory of spin relaxation processes in multi-valley semiconductors such as silicon and germanium. The spin relaxation in these materials shows a strong dependence on the identity of the donor atom. By invoking analytical and numerical methods, the PI will quantify the donor-driven spin relaxation by establishing a connection with the induced changes in the donor ground state due to the spin orbit coupling. The effect will be investigated as a function of strain, temperature, donor concentration, and donor identity. <br/>Apart from group IV materials, monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides and oxides present another important class of materials potentially useful for spintronics. These two-dimensional monolayer semiconductors put together exotic charge, spin and valley electronic phenomena. The strong binding between electrons and holes, a result of the impeded Coulomb screening in genuine 2D systems, enables exceptionally strong light-matter interaction that persists up to room temperature.<br/>The PI will systematically quantify the momentum scattering and spin relaxation due to electron-phonon interaction in two-dimensional crystals such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides. Transport effects will include signatures of electrical fields via piezoelectricity and symmetry breaking by the gate voltage. The PI will also analyze the often-discussed topological insulator phase in two-dimensional crystals from the perspective of relaxation.<br/>The PI aims to recruit qualified undergraduate students to participate in the research, and teach a new course on spintronics which explains how quantum mechanics and magnetism can be applied into new logic and memory architectures. The PI will try to recruit McNair scholars and will work with the Kearns Center at the University of Rochester to attract students from under-represented minorities to this research."

0.119998,"The understanding and eventual control of complicated phenomena is a primary goal of scientific research. ""Universality"" refers to robustness of certain phenomena and to the counterintuitive prevalence of the same phenomena across a wide array of different physical situations and models. For example, waves in the ocean can organize themselves into ""trains"" transporting energy, and analogous trains are also observed in laser beams propagating in optical fibers; statistical fluctuations in nuclear experiments led to a new type of universality that subsequently has been observed in a wide variety of situations modeled with randomness, as far-flung as the statistics of spacings between parked cars! This research project involves the detailed rigorous analysis of canonical models for a wide variety of physical settings whose singular behavior is a guide for the understanding of some complicated phenomena in nature. The project aims to develop methods to understand, predict, and control system behavior. The potential long-term impacts of this research program stem from the emergence of universality as a new paradigm in science: probing its range of applicability is fundamental in emerging areas as well as established ones.<br/><br/>This research project concerns the development of new methods for the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems and d-bar problems and application of these techniques to problems in a range of fields including random matrix theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, orthogonal polynomials, and asymptotic combinatorics. In each of these areas, the overarching goal is to provide a complete description of the system (be it the eigenvalues of a random matrix, or the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation). Two examples under study are: (1) Eigenvalue statistics in the normal matrix model. The quest for universal behavior when the eigenvalues are accumulating in a two-dimensional region is in its infancy; this project aims to create connections between rigorous mathematical analysis and physical intuition developed over the last 20 years. (2) The asymptotic behavior of the partition function in the two-cut regime, for which ideas and conjectural formulae have existed for some time."
0.4,"The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to quantify the material behavior of liquid crystal polymer networks that change their shape in response to light.

More specifically, this research program proposes to gain unprecedented control and enhancement of the multiscale design of a technologically important living material system, bacterial cellulose, which has great potential for use as textiles, drug delivery devices, tissue engineering scaffolds, and sustainable building components. This research will enable simultaneous tuning of the material (structure and properties) and macroscopic 3D shape of this biopolymer. An interdisciplinary approach will be taken involving synthetic biology and genetic engineering, in-situ extracellular and materials processing, algorithmic design methods from the field of architecture, as well as powerful new additive manufacturing fabrication (3D printing with micron-scale spatial resolution). This study combines three disciplines - synthetic biology, materials science, and architectural design and has a broader impact contribution for all three. For synthetic biology, foundational methodologies are created that could be extended to any biological polymer (e.g. protein block co-polymers, cellulose, amyloids, etc.). For architectural design, the opportunity to apply methods of algorithmic design and additive manufacturing to living matter is novel and opens up new questions about possibilities of design in interaction with biological growth and material formation to produce sustainable and environmentally responsive materials and building components from renewable resources. For materials science, the project suggests systematic study of combination of material structure, properties and morphometry as a way to design materials and further enhance their function and performance with specific functionalization through synthetic gene networks regulated by external stimuli. Participation in these projects will educate students to cross disciplinary boundaries and work across scales of resolution to develop sustainable design manufacturing techniques for microbial production. Additional educational activities for this study include Independent Activity Period (IAP) interdisciplinary class at MIT ""Designing Shape, Material, and Life"", instruction in the worldwide synthetic biology competition for undergraduate and high school students iGEM (International Genetic Engineering Machine), and science exhibitions, such as MIT Museum and Cambridge Science Fair. Lastly, mentoring of summer students via undergraduate research programs at MIT will be carried out.<br/><br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>This research program proposes to control and tune the material (structure and properties) and macroscopic morphometry (3D shape) of a technologically important model system (bacterial cellulose), which has potential for use as textiles, drug delivery devices, tissue engineering scaffolds, and sustainable building components.

The first aim of this research is to modulate the structure and properties of cellulose as it is synthesized by the bacteria Gluconacetobacter xylinus via the use of UV lithography regulation and synthetic biological networks encoding fusion proteins production. Secondly, the role of the in situ extracellular physicochemical environmental conditions and perturbations on the structure and properties of bacterial cellulose will be investigated. The resulting macromolecular structure and properties of the produced cellulose will be assessed by cross-polarized optical, electron and atomic-force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, multi-directional mechanical testing, and nanoindentation. Lastly, algorithmic design and 3D printing will be utilized to fabricate increasingly complex macroscopic structures with tunable geometric parameters of molds which are subsequently used to cast polydimethylsiloxane substrates for in situ culture and growth of genetically engineered bacterial cellulose."
0.148346,"Chemical Communities: Explaining Variation in Citizen Effects on Policy-Relevant Science and Industrial Transformation in Three Nations<br/><br/>Citizen participation in the governance of science-based industries can improve the quality of policy and science by providing insights that are not always seen or understood by policymakers or scientists. Such participation is especially important in the governance of industries with significant actual and potential effects on the environment, such as nuclear power and chemical production. Yet much of what is understood about the forms and outcomes of citizen participation is based on single case studies. We also know very little about how scientists' professional cultures, and the materiality of science-based industries, including their layout and their environmental effects, mediate between citizen participation and the governance of the environmental effects of science-based industries. <br/><br/>This study uses theories and evidence from Science and Technology Studies to carry out a comparative study of citizen participation in the governance of chemical industries in three major chemical regions: Ludwigshafen, Germany; Porto Marghera, Italy; and the chemical corridor in Louisiana, USA. The research will demonstrate how national-level variation in regulatory and legal structures, in national and professional science cultures, and the material structures and practices of each site shape citizen effects on policy-relevant environmental knowledge. New knowledge about how scientists understand their role as mediators between policymakers and citizens will be developed. A second major contribution of the project is that it will show how variation in material factors, including environmental conditions and the structure of the industrial sites themselves, shape citizen participation. Research will be carried out through analysis of relevant documents, interviews, and ethnographic fieldwork. Results of this study will contribute to theories of citizen participation in policy relevant science, of environmental governance, and of how scientific cultures shape citizen participation in science. <br/><br/>The broader impacts lie in the development of theories of governance that is likely to be of value to policymakers, scientists, citizen groups, and those involved in the governance of chemical industries. The comparative approach used here will provide new knowledge about how and why citizen involvement in the governance of industries with significant environmental impacts works more effectively in some places than in others."
1.3,"Semiconductor nanoparticles are attractive for enhancing the color quality and efficiency of display and lighting applications. Synthetic techniques are currently unable to produce particles that are bright, that emit color pure, and that are stable without using materials that contain toxic heavy metals. This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) research project is designed to produce application ready and heavy metal free nanoparticles suitable for applications in lighting and display technologies. Experimental methods and theoretical studies will be combined to improve our general understanding of the chemical and physical forces that control nanoparticle growth. Special chemical reactors that allow the researchers to study the molecular mechanisms of nanoparticle growth will be designed. Theoretical work using computer models of the nanoparticle surface and the molecules involved in growth will be used to complement these studies and gain a deeper understanding into the processes involved. By combining the experimental and theoretical results from these experiments, the researchers intend to develop a predictive model of nanoparticle growth that will insight into possible paths for the production of heavy metal free application ready nanoparticles. This understanding will allow the researchers to design synthetic methods to produce nanoparticles that meet the requirements for implementation in lighting and display applications and provide consumers with energy efficient displays with vibrant, rich colors. This research will impact national nanotechnology challenges through publishing, patenting, and industrial collaborations. Graduate students will be educated in synthesis and scalable manufacturing of quantum dots. Undergraduate research will be an integral part of the labs through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at MIT. The impact of this fundamental research on science and technology will be disseminated to the K-12 educational audience through a series of video productions.<br/><br/>To be attractive for use in lighting and display technologies, fluorescent nanoparticles must be efficient and bright with narrow photoluminescence spectra. Currently, the only nanoparticles that are able to meet the specifications required for high impact applications in display technologies contain the heavy metal cadmium and are based on cadmium selenide. The most promising heavy metal free substitute for quantum dots for color downshifting applications is indium phosphide. However, it is not currently possible to make indium phosphide based materials with the narrow spectral linewidths required to meet the specifications of display applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that there are substantial challenges both in understanding the dynamics and mechanistics of nanoparticle growth at the earliest stages. This work will explore the earliest stages of nanoparticle growth by using stopped flow nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study the evolution of the reagents just after mixing. Furthermore, continuous flow systems will be integrated with mass spectrometers in order to measure and quantify the evolution of species that form early in the reaction that are not well suited to NMR characterization. These experimental measurements will be complemented and informed by theoretical techniques that model the inorganic-organic interface at the nanoparticle surface, identify potential sources of surface poisoning and explore possible methods to mitigate this problem through techniques such as etching. A comprehensive model of the factors that control the dynamics of nanoparticle growth will be developed that includes the dynamics of never-before-characterized intermediate molecular species and their interaction with the nanoparticle surface. This model will be tested using a microfluidic reactor that allows rapid, reproducible scanning of growth conditions. As it is verified, the model will be used to predict the optimal conditions for control of nanoparticle size and size distribution. The continuous flow synthesis is both well suited for the fundamental study required to improve indium phosphide synthesis as well as inherently scalable for applications in lighting and consumer electronics."
0.375,"The goal of this project is to establish a new design and control method for highly maneuverable underwater robots to perform inspection of underwater structures. Compact, egg-shaped robots will allow us to bring inspection instruments to those complex underwater structures that have seldom been inspected. Those include reactor internals of nuclear power plants and the equipment of hydro-dams, both of which require access to dangerous sites for inspection and monitoring. Furthermore, the highly maneuverable robot can be applied to port security, offshore facility monitoring, and cable network maintenance. Collaborations with energy industries and others will be sought for disseminating the new design method.<br/><br/>The project will study egg-shaped robots, having no rudders and appendages. The compact and smooth body shape allows the robot to access complex underwater structures with multi-axis jets. The spheroidal vehicle, however, is hydro-dynamically unstable and thereby not appropriate from the traditional submarine design viewpoint. This project will argue that the vehicle instability can be exploited for quick turning and agile movements, a design concept similar to Control-Configured Vehicles in aeronautics, and how such vehicles can be designed optimally from the dynamics and control viewpoint. The project aims to stabilize the vehicle, yet maximize the maneuvering capability, through the design of high-speed water valves, effective configuration of multi-axis jets, optimization of the vehicle body shape, and control synthesis."
0.15,"Our modern world is run by electrons--they flow through our smart phones, computers, and machines to carry out a myriad of tasks from data storage and calculations to heavy lifting when employed in electromagnets. It is surprising that we do not better understand how electrons work together. This award supports studies of a novel substance, an ultracold gas of strongly interacting atoms, which behaves in many ways like electrons. For example, just like a metal becomes ""superconducting"" at low temperatures and starts to conduct electricity without resistance, the atomic gas becomes ""superfluid"" and atoms flow without friction. However, scaled to the density of electrons in metals, superfluidity would occur in the atomic gas already far above room temperature, thanks to the strong interatomic interactions. Just like electrons, but also protons and neutrons, the atoms belong to the class of particles called fermions, which cannot share one and the same state. This requirement makes computations extremely difficult and experiments indispensable to learn about the behavior of fermions. Confined in an artificial ""box"" of light, the atomic Fermi gas will be a pristine platform to learn about the equation of state of strongly interacting fermions, as they occur in modern materials, for example high-temperature superconductors, but also in neutron stars and nuclear matter. With the help of these and other studies, we might be led to an understanding on how to realize room temperature superconductivity. The project also holds the potential for observing new states of fermionic matter such as a supersolid--a superfluid that is also ordered like a crystal. The research will present a stimulating learning experience for graduate students.<br/><br/>Ultracold Fermi gases of atoms represent a paradigmatic form of fermionic matter, where all details of the interparticle interaction, the external confinement, and the spin composition are precisely known and under the control of the experimenter. This project employs a Fermi gas of Lithium-6 atoms to try to answer long-standing questions about 1) the thermodynamics of two- and three-dimensional systems, 2) the fate of fermionic superfluidity in the presence of spin imbalance and 3) non-equilibrium dynamics in fermionic superfluids. The Fermi gas will be confined in tailored potentials, in particular a homogeneous box potential and a hybrid harmonic-box potential. Creating a homogeneous Fermi gas will take away many of the existing experimental limitations in obtaining accurate thermodynamic information. The box potential allows accessing new phases of fermionic matter that have not been observed before. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless superfluid in two dimensions features algebraic order that would be masked in an inhomogeneous trap. A homogeneous 3D Fermi superfluid in the presence of spin imbalance should spontaneously break translational symmetry by forming a train of solitons, where excess fermions reside in the nodes of the order parameter. This describes the famous Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) state, a supersolid phase of matter that has not been conclusively observed despite five decades of research. In the present work, soliton trains will be directly created in the presence of spin imbalance, thereby engineering the LO state."
0.3,"This award supports a new program of research by the MIT group of Mike Williams on the LHCb Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, Geneva, Switzerland. The primary function of LHCb is to search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) by studying rare and CP-violating decays of b and c hadrons. For at least the next five years, LHCb will be the premier flavor-physics experiment in the world. Williams has been one of the principal architects of the high-level trigger (HLT) for LHCb in the recent past. This trigger allowed LHCb to collect a nearly 100% pure b-bbar sample during experimental operations in 2011 and 2012. The PI wrote this trigger, making MIT uniquely qualified as a group to prepare the experiment to handle future running conditions, including a collision energy of 13-TeV and significantly higher luminosity. <br/><br/>MIT has a strong record in outreach, and PI Williams will build upon this tradition with links to the LHCb program. Over the past 6 summers, undergraduate students from the NSF-supported REU program at Hampton University have participated in the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP). These students are supervised by members of the MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science (LNS) and interact with various LNS faculty, staff and students. This program provides a unique opportunity for minority students to experience life at a large research institute. Beginning in the summer of 2013, students from this program will be able to do flavor-physics research using LHCb data."
0.515574,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Sustainable energy technologies play an important role in paving the way to a future in which the society has clean, secure and affordable energy. This project advances our understanding of the mechano-chemical coupling in oxides to tune their transport and reactivity properties and contribute to the development of diverse energy systems. By knowing how mechanical strain alters the material behavior at the atomic level, the reaction and transport kinetics can be accelerated for more efficient solid oxide fuel cells to produce electricity, to split water and CO2 for synthetic fuels production; or can be decelerated to suppress corrosion of key structural materials, for example, in nuclear plants or concentrated solar plants. An international collaboration with Professor Juergen Fleig at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria will extend the PI's and students' scientific capabilities and help gain complementary research experience. The multidisciplinary education and research efforts of the project will strengthen the knowledge-base in the curriculum for energy challenges. An outreach program from K-12 youth to undergraduates with individual mentoring and long-term tracking by the PI is intended to broaden the participation of especially female and Hispanic students in science and engineering careers. The results from research will be disseminated at the MIT museum to educate the public on the importance of research targeted at materials for clean and affordable energy.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The goal of this CAREER project is to advance our understanding of the mechano-chemical coupling on surfaces of functional oxides for energy, by developing new research and educational approaches that integrate multidisciplinary principles. The knowledge that will be gained on the atomic-level structural, chemical, and electronic nature of the oxide surfaces is central to the longstanding fundamental aspects of fast oxygen transport and electrocatalytic activity at moderate temperatures. The science objectives of the project tie the mechanistic and quantitative effects of lattice strain to: 1) surface chemistry and atomic structure, 2) surface electronic structure, 3) oxygen surface exchange kinetics, and 4) oxygen diffusion kinetics. The project's approach integrates novel surface sensitive platforms with first principles-based simulations to provide an atomic level view of the epitaxially-strained thin film oxide surfaces. Major intellectual contributions are: 1) coupling of mechanics and surface chemistry to control the kinetics of transport and reactivity at the molecular level on transition metal oxides, and 2) new experimental probes to reveal the dynamic nature of surfaces at high temperatures and pressures. In particular, the advancements of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at elevated temperatures and in reactive gas conditions is an important capability not only for this project, but also for serving as a general surface science platform to examine materials in harsh environments. This project enables the education and research experience of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced experimental and computational techniques, including in international settings, targeted at materials science for energy.<br/><br/>This grant is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE)'s Europe and Eurasia Program."

In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research by postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students at Utah State University, the USDA Poisonous Plant Research Laboratory, and the regional USU campus at the Uintah Basin. It will also impact outreach activities involving minority student populations.<br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) advancing metabolic engineering and synthetic biology; (b) understanding the roles of metals in biological systems and developing reagents for biological use; (c) developing new carbohydrate-containing molecules with useful biological activities; (d) understanding the details of phosphate ester hydrolysis reactivity in biological systems; (e) developing new catalysts for water splitting reactivity with relevance to solar energy production; (f) identifying poisonous plant toxins; and (g) advancing natural products synthesis."

0.099999,"PI: Gang Wu<br/>Proposal Number: 1511528<br/><br/>Rechargeable lithium ion batteries support the development of sustainable energy systems by storing electricity generated by renewable resources such as wind and solar energy, or by powering zero-emission electric vehicles charged by electricity from renewable resources. However, the storage capacity, recharging time, and power output from current lithium ion batteries must improve to enable further market penetration for electric vehicles. The goal of this project is to redesign the carbon electrode of the battery to make fundamental improvements in performance. The new carbon electrode will be based on graphene, a form of carbon that is ordered into sheets one atom thick. New methods will be developed to form graphene into a three-dimensional structure designed through scientific principles to provide high capacity, rapid recharge times, and stability during repeated charging. The educational activities associated with this project include summer research experiences for three undergraduate students from under-represented groups in engineering, and hands-on outreach to elementary schools in the Buffalo, New York area.<br/><br/>Nanostructured graphene has emerged as a potentially transformative material for replacing porous carbon in the anode of rechargeable lithium ion batteries for transportation applications because it offers the potential for high surface area and electronic conductivity, leading to higher capacity and faster charge/discharge rates. However, under repeated charge/discharge cycles, the storage capacity fades rapidly because the graphene sheets restack. New synthesis approaches for nanographene are needed to address this problem and to extend the capabilities of graphene for use in lithium ion battery anodes. The overall goals of this proposed research are to rationally design stable, three-dimensional graphene anodes of defined structure and electronic properties for lithium ion batteries through atomic level self-assembly and heteroatom substitution, and then develop a fundamental understanding of lithium ion insertion and extraction processes in this anode. The proposed research has three objectives. The first objective is to develop new and scalable synthetic protocols to prepare a series of structurally stable, nitrogen(N)-doped nanographenes with functional linkers via Suzuki coupling and covalent stabilization, and then fine-tune the lattice geometry and electronic properties of the final three-dimensional structure through controlled d-lattice spacing and N-doping level. Material properties will be characterized by photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopies. The second objective is to establish a fundamental understanding of lithium ion adsorption, desorption, and diffusion kinetics on doped nanographene using nanographene model systems of well-defined molecular size, structure, and doping. Towards this end, in situ electrochemical neutron experiments complimented by high-resolution transmission electron microscope imaging and microanalysis techniques will be used to measure changes in composition, structure, and thermodynamic processes of graphene anodes during lithium ion insertion/extraction reactions. The lithium reaction mechanisms on nitrogen-doped nanographene will be investigated computationally by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and nanoscale dynamic simulation. The third objective is to design and synthesize structured three-dimensional porous nanographene anode materials with chemical and structural properties designed to optimize lithium capacity, diffusion rate, and cyclic stability. Research outcomes will also be used to develop instructional materials for a new course on advanced energy materials at the University of Buffalo."
0.1878,"Non-technical abstract<br/><br/>Semiconductor quantum dots have discrete energy levels similar to those in an atom, thus they are often described as as ""artificial atoms"". Unlike atoms, the energy level structure of a quantum dot can be engineered, making them attractive for a wide range of applications ranging from highly efficient lasers to quantum information processing. In addition, quantum dots can be embedded in solid-state devices, a key feature for use in applications. When quantum dots are brought into proximity to one another, their interaction results in new states, just as the interaction between atoms results in the formation of molecules. This project will employ a new coherent optical method to observe and characterize the interactions between quantum dots with sufficient spatial resolution to isolate a single dot or a small set of interacting dots. This new optical method is inspired by established magnetic resonance tachniques that are used to determine molecular structure. Furthermore, the spectroscopic technique developed by this project will have broader applications. For example, it could be used to study excitation processes in photovoltaic solar cells. This project will combine research and education by training students in the multidisciplinary field of coherent optical spectroscopy of solid state systems. This training will include the basic science of the interaction of condensed matter systems with light as well as practical aspects of photonics and microfabrication.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Semiconductor quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy have possible applications ranging from low-threshold laser diodes to implementing qubits in quantum information science. Epitaxially grown quantum dots have been studied extensively using single dot techniques, however single dot techniques are not as good at probing the coupling between quantum dots. Interactions can dramatically alter the optical and electronic properties of quantum dots. Furthermore, quantum information schemes require that there be controllable interactions between qubits, and hence between quantum dots. This project probes the coupling between quantum dots using a new implementation of optical multi-dimensional coherent spectroscopy based on photocurrent readout and applying it to small ensembles of InGaAs quantum dots. Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy was originally developed in nuclear magnetic resonance. Over the last decade, there has been extensive progress in implementing two-dimensional spectroscopy in the infrared and optical regions of the spectrum. The principal investigator's group is a leader in developing methods for using it to study electronic transitions in semiconductors using near-infrared light. Recently these studies have included large ensembles of GaAs natural quantum dots and InAs self-assembled quantum dots. However, the methods used so far, based on detecting an optical signal produced by the third-order nonlinear response of the sample, are not appropriate for use on small ensembles of quantum emitters, which will not generate a well formed signal beam. Thus this project uses a new approach to two-dimensional spectroscopy that detects a fourth-order population through measurement of photocurrent. This approach will be applied to InAs quantum dots and quantum dot molecules embedded in a diode structure. The goal is to understand and measure the interactions between quantum dots to advance the fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in these nanoscale systems. This understanding can improve the design of systems with target quantum mechanical states and dynamics."

1.099945,"The goal of this project is to use the information provided by the one-time, 2011 release of radio isotopes, and in particular, cesium (137Cs, ~30-year half-life and 134Cs, ~2-year half-life) and strontium (90Sr, 29-year half-life) from the Dai-ichi Fukushima nuclear power plants in northern Japan to better understand the pathways, mixing and transport of water in the North Pacific Ocean. The PIs will analyze surface & profile samples from the 2013 zonal CLIVAR 30N transect for strontium; and obtain and analyze upper water column cesium (Cs) and strontium (Sr) profiles along the 2015 meridional CLIVAR line at 150W. These observations, along with ocean cesium and iodine data collected over the last two and a half years, will be combined with satellite, drifter and float observations, an ocean model analysis and atmospheric modeling results to illuminate the details of the horizontal spread and vertical mixing that will have taken place over the 4 year period since the release of the isotopes. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The Cs and Sr observations and analysis, particularly when combined with other observed properties and numerical models, will provide a unique window from which to view water mass formation and the temporal scale of transformation within the North Pacific. This investigation seeks to better understand the fate of Fukushima radioisotopes released and deposited in the North Pacific -- how far and how deeply they range 2 to 4 years after being introduced. Although levels of this radioactivity in the ocean are not considered dangerous, the questions of where it is, and exactly how much there is, remain topics of particular interest to those who live on North Pacific shores and fish in its waters. At the same time it is asked what this unique tracer can say about ocean advection and diffusion processes. The PIs intend to use the results from the observations to improve their own model simulation and to validate disparate community modeling efforts forecasting radioisotope contamination of waters off the US west coast. Conclusions drawn concerning the variability in the mixing and spreading of Fukushima isotopes will be relevant to those seeking to understand the role of physical processes on biological production, nutrient cycling and CO2 uptake as this truly unique set of decadal-scale tracers will reveal the rates and patterns of basin-scale upper-ocean mixing and advective processes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: To maximize the scientific benefit of the proposed samples through multi-tracer analysis, as well as to develop stronger ties with other labs working with Fukushima derived isotopes, and support the education of a young researcher, a graduate student from P. Masque's University of Barcelona lab will be invited to spend two semesters at WHOI to measure 90Sr activities in the North Pacific hydrographic samples. During the 1st summer of the project, a WHOI summer student fellow (3rd year undergraduate) will be invited to participate in the observational component of the project through analyses of hydrography, float profiles or altimetry. To further international collaboration with Japanese colleagues and assist in the development of new methods for reducing detection limits M. Aoyama will be invited to visit the WHOI isotope lab from Tokyo. In addition, a public website will be created on which results will be posted. All members of the group intend to engage in outreach at various levels through their continued work with the following programs: mentoring of local middle and high school students using cruise observations for science fair projects, classroom visits and public outreach presentations, interviews and talks."
0.304719,"This project will significantly advance the understanding of the physical regulation of the cell nucleus in structurally complex and hierarchical biological tissues. The nucleus is a central membrane-bound organelle in the cell that functions to control fundamental cellular activities that are critical to normal physiology. More broadly, the research activities may impact tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and related fields, by establishing the ability to study mechanisms of nuclear strain and gene expression in single cells, including studies of rare cell populations within tissues and biomaterials. The education plan is designed to provide an interactive and problem-solving approach toward learning. The education activities emphasize undergraduate and graduate course development in mechanobiology, and broaden a partnership between the awardee's institution and a children's museum to promote learning in science and engineering from an early age.<br/><br/>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to apply advanced microscopy, image registration, and molecular biology methods to study the biomechanics of the cell nucleus and basic mechanisms that determine the physical regulation of gene expression. Studies conducted under this award will image the nucleus of single cells embedded in native tissue that is perturbed by mechanical force, and determine the influence of cytoskeleton proteins on intranuclear shape, deformation, and activity. A multiscale and translational approach will also study the nucleus in normal and genetically modified mice to investigate how mechanical force regulates gene expression in vivo. The knowledge gained from the research activities will reveal how subcellular strain is altered in disease and injury, and studies will establish new analysis tools for the noninvasive, in vivo, and functional biomechanical assessment of nuclei in model systems."
0.099372,"Understanding the composition of the Earth is crucial to constraining under which conditions it formed along with the rest of the solar system. The more we can learn about the Earth, the better suited we are to understanding how planets form in general and why the planets are all so different. Many elements that are abundant on Earth have stable isotopes (same number of protons, different number of neutrons) that have been studied extensively for their use as tracers for physical and chemical processes. However these isotopes have largely not been explored for how they can trace processes occurring at high pressure, such as during the formation of our planet's core. This proposal is aimed at studying the composition of the core of the Earth through experiments at high pressure and theoretical calculations of the isotopic ratios. The goal is to place an independent constraint on the composition of the core, which has critical implications on the formation and evolution of our planet. <br/><br/>The principle of using stable isotopes to probe the bulk chemical composition of planets lies with the combination of isotope fractionation and sequestration of elements in inaccessible reservoirs like the Earth's core. Experiments at high pressure and temperature can reveal the equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors that cannot be directly measured in planetary materials and when combined with isotopic ratios found in natural materials provide a constraint on the formation conditions of those materials. The principal aim of this proposal is to understand how the light elements bonded to iron in the core can affect the distribution of isotopes during core formation. Ths Pis will do this by determining how various phases (Fe3C, FeO, FeS, FeHx) isotopic fractionation factors are affected by pressure. This study relies on mineral physics techniques and experiments (DAC experiments at the synchrotron using nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering) combined with isotope geochemistry calculations and analyses. It is a truly interdisciplinary project that can only be accomplished with the right expertise and has the potential to make a large imprint on several fields of geoscience. The main research goals of this proposal are to: reveal how iron stable isotope ratios under extreme pressure conditions can be used to understand planet formation and differentiation; determine the effect of bonding partners on iron stable isotope fractionation so as to investigate the light element in cores of differentiated objects; and calculate theoretical iron isotopic fractionation factors based on high pressure NRIXS synchrotron experiments."
1.073388,"With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professors Jonas Peters, Theodor Agapie and colleagues from the California Institute of Technology aquire an X-, Q-band pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer and related accessories including electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR). This instrument allows research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species with unpaired electrons behave. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. In a standard ENDOR experiment, a sample is placed in a magnetic field and irradiated sequentially with a microwave followed by radio frequency. The changes are then detected by monitoring variations in the polarization of the saturated electron paramagnetic resonance transition. These studies impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument is an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Caltech. Additionally, the investigators have identified a significant number of interested users from the area outside of this institution and also identified a lot of enthusiasm for a hands-on workshop on EPR/pulsed-EPR that is expected to grow the regional user base.<br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as: (a) the iron-molybdenum co-factor (FeMoco) and nitrogen fixation; (b) models of iron-mediated nitrogen fixation; (c) oxygen-evolving complex in photosynthesis; (d) nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling; (e)photoredox catalysis; (f) spin-active metal-dihydrogen and metal-hydride species; (g) metallonitrenes in catalysis; (h) using C1 and C2 precursors for carbon-carbon couplings; and (i) site directed spin labeling (SDSL) for the study of biogenesis of membrane and secretory proteins."
0.126142,"Over 40% of the world's food supply is lost to damage caused by pathogens, pests and weeds. Therefore, novel strategies to enhance plant productivity and resistance to pests will significantly increase the security of the world's food supply. To achieve this goal, a deep understanding the mechanisms that control resistance to insects is needed. This project is at the cutting edge of plant-insect interactions and will reveal how chloroplasts communicate with nuclei to coordinate a robust defense after injury and insect attack; this knowledge will enable new strategies for insect resistance in the future. This project is a fertile training ground for a graduate student. Graduate student leadership skills will be developed through guiding undergraduate's in this project. UCR is a minority-serving institution and this project will recruit and engage students with diverse backgrounds. Results from the project will be disseminated by publications in scientific journals, lay talks to Riverside K-12 schools and the public, and talks at meetings and universities.<br/><br/>This project will study the importance of a tomato chloroplast-localized protein called leucine aminopeptidase (LAP-A) and its role in generating a signal that controls nuclear gene expression after insect feeding and wounding. This project will identify the LAP-A-dependent signal that mediates this chloroplast-to-nucleus communication. The protein/peptide (target) that LAP-A acts on will be identified and the target may be the signal or may create the signal. LAP-A has two activities. LAP-A is an aminopeptidase and may produce the signal by modifying the N-terminus of a target protein/peptide that resides in the chloroplast. LAP-A is also a molecular chaperone and may help targets stay in an active folded state. These activities should influence the target's structure, activity and/or stability and thereby signal production. This project will use cutting-edge proteomics technologies to measure proteins/peptides in three tomato lines that express different levels of LAP-A (LapA-silenced, LapA-overexpressing, and wild type). Aim 1 will identify chloroplast proteins that are (1) cut by LAP-A and (2) have altered stability that is strictly correlated with the presence/absence of LAP-A. Aim 2 will determine the LAP-A-dependent changes in a small peptide called glutathione (GSH). Preliminary data link LAP-A and GSH turnover. GSH is an excellent candidate for the signal as it regulates two defense signals (reactive oxygen species and redox status) in other systems. The identity of LAP-A's targets will reveal the nature of the LAP-A-generated signal that mediates chloroplast-nucleus communication."
0.199458,"Salt rock is used for secure storage of oil, high-pressure gas, and nuclear waste because of its ability to creep and form barriers to gas and fluid flow. However, creep processes near subsurface storage facilities can lead to crack debonding, opening, closure and rebonding that compromise the integrity of flow barriers and stability of engineered structures. Mathematical descriptions of cracking and healing are incompletely developed. This award will support fundamental rock physics and mechanics research to link deformation by crack debonding, opening and rebonding to microstructures and mechanical variables that govern the time-dependent behavior of salt rock over geological space and time scales. Deformation of salt occurs rapidly at laboratory conditions making it a good analog to study damage and healing in other crystalline materials and porous media. Project findings are expected to advance quantitative relations enabling accurate modeling and prediction of behaviors in engineering projects. The work will advance fundamental understanding of cracking and healing in other rocks that deform by the same processes, especially around earthquake faults and zones of induced seismicity. The team of geoscience and engineering researchers will collaborate with other programs to broaden the participation of women and other under-represented groups in research and engineering.<br/><br/>Most continuum damage models for salt are based on the concept of dilatancy boundary, and do not account for crack-induced anisotropy of elastic properties. Micro-mechanics and homogenization principles were successfully employed to model salt rock elastoplastic behavior, but were not used to test scale invariance of microstructure to transitions in deformation regimes. The goal of this project is to link salt deformation regimes and rheological behaviors with the density and orientation distribution of microstructures. Deformation regimes at the scale of a Representative Elementary Volume will be decomposed into independent processes (e.g., cracking), each related to different microstructure descriptors (e.g., grain aspect ratio). Macroscopic thermodynamic variables will be formally related to the microstructure descriptors to test the space and time scale invariance of transition points in deformation regimes. Specific research objectives are to: (1) Identify topological components and subcomponents of salt microstructure; (2) Determine the energy cost of intra- and inter-granular crack debonding, opening, closure and rebonding; (3) Compute energy thresholds associated with transitions between deformation regimes at the grain and REV scales; (4) Test the time and scale dependence of microstructure organization during transitions; (5) Design rock salt microstructural systems that optimize healing properties in subsurface storage environments."
0.2,"Seismological and cosmochemical observations indicate that the main constituent in Earth's core is iron, which is thought to be alloyed with ~10 wt% nickel and some light elements (e.g. S, Si, O, C, H). Earth's core consists of a solid inner region surrounded by a liquid outer core. The melting temperature of iron at high-pressure provides an important reference point for the temperature distribution within Earth's core and affects a number of important geophysical quantities related to this region: heat flow across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), the temperature gradient within the thermal boundary layer above the CMB, the phase relations, and expected seismic wave speeds of candidate phases. More specifically, the melting point of iron at the boundary between the liquid outer core and solid inner core provides an upper bound of the temperature at that interface, because studies thus far indicate that all plausible outer core liquids coexist with corresponding inner core alloy solids at or below the melting point of pure iron. Previously, melting studies of iron at high-pressures were performed by shock-compression, resistive- and laser-heating in diamond anvil cells using visual observations or synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and theoretical methods. However, the melting curve of iron with respect to its alloys remains uncertain, especially at pressures above 70 GPa. <br/><br/>The PI has developed a novel metric for detecting the solid-liquid phase boundary of iron-bearing materials at high-pressures using 57Fe synchrotron Mssbauer spectroscopy (SMS), also known as nuclear forward scattering. Focused synchrotron radiation with 1 meV bandwidth passes through a laser-heated 57Fe-bearing sample inside a diamond anvil cell. The characteristic SMS time signature vanishes when melting occurs. This process is described by the Lamb-Mssbauer factor, a quantity that is directly related to the mean-square displacement of the iron atoms. Therefore, we measure the dynamics of the atoms in the material, in contrast to a static diffraction measurement. As this method monitors the dynamics of the atoms, the SMS technique provides a new and independent means of melting point determination for materials under high-pressure. We have successfully performed such melting investigations on pure iron up to 82 GPa. Our data define a different melting trend compared with previous studies, thus providing important rationale to proceed further with this method on iron and iron-alloys at higher pressures. The melting experiments will be conducted to pressures of at least 80 GPa for the alloys and higher than 80 GPa for pure iron, at sector 3-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. By constraining the relative melting curves of these iron-alloys at high-PT conditions, we will provide a new constraint on the effect of select light-element alloying to iron?s melting behavior. These outcomes will represent a significant step towards understanding the melting of iron-rich alloys at conditions of terrestrial-type planetary cores and thus provide necessary temperature constraints of their respective interiors."
0.171228,"The project will consist of a number of research and educational activities centered around the study of randomness, symmetry, paradoxicality, and dimensionality in dynamical systems. The goal is to understand the way that combinatorial, geometric, and topological phenomena interrelate within a newly broadened scope in dynamics that has been opened up by recent advances in entropy theory, the theory of infinite groups, and the classification program for nuclear C*-algebras. The investigations will be rooted in the combinatorial and probabilistic notions of independence and the various dichotomies to which they relate either as a source or as a counterpoint. Both the research and educational components of the program will bridge to several other branches of mathematics including geometric and combinatorial group theory, algebraic topology, convex geometry, and descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>The mathematical theory of dynamics seeks to establish a rigorous framework for understanding the kinds of behavior that one might observe in a physical system as it evolves in time. In a chaotic system our ability to make predictions about the future state of the system is limited or null, and there are different ways in which this unpredictability can be made mathematically precise, for example via the notion of entropy. These concepts are all tied to the probabilistic notion of independence, which is exhibited in its most basic form by the repeated tossing of a coin. A general system will typically combine both deterministic and indeterministic aspects, often in an intricate way. This project aims to develop new tools for identifying the presence of independence in its various dynamical guises and its effect on associated mathematical structures such as operator algebras. On the practical side, the interest in such an endeavor lies in its significance for the study of problems in information theory involving code transmission and error correction."
0.017682,"Core-collapse supernova explosions from massive stars and collisions of neutron star mergers are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe. In these explosions and collisions, the key chemical elements of live (oxygen, carbon, iron etc.) and all heavy elements, including the rare earths metals, are synthesized and expelled into the interstellar medium. The goal of this PRAC project is to simulate core-collapse supernovae and the remnants of neutron star collisions at unprecedented physical detail. The investigators will use high-resolution three-dimensional simulations that include general relativity, fluid dynamics, radiation transport of neutrinos, magnetic fields, and a sophisticated description of the properties of the ultra-high density matter present in the cores of supernovae and neutron star collision remnants. The simulations will yield a deeper understanding of the processes occurring as a star turns from collapse to explosion and will elucidate the role of magnetic fields in both core-collapse supernovae and in the evolution of collision remnants. This will, in turn, yield better predictions for signals (in gravitational waves, neutrinos, and electromagnetic waves, and synthesized elements) from these phenomena. Astronomical observations can then be used to test theoretical models and constrain present uncertainties in nuclear physics and astrophysics."

0.8,"This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project from the University of Nevada-Reno has as its goal the enhancement of the situational awareness capabilities of law enforcement agencies and first responders by employing unmanned autonomous systems (UAS) with high-resolution sensing and imaging capabilities for disaster remediation. Law enforcement agencies and first responders face significant challenges during an emergency event, such as a natural or anthropogenic disaster (earthquake, tsunami, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood, power or nuclear accident, act of war, or terror). One of the major challenges is acting decisively based on available information and considering human factors, making high-quality real-time situational awareness critical to effectively manage and safeguard civilians and in- field personnel. This project focuses on creating a smart emergency-response service system using UAS, both air- and ground-based systems, equipped with state-of-the-art imaging, sensing, and communication systems to provide first response teams with high-quality, real-time information to act decisively and effectively via human-machine interactions. Such a smart service system will guide/escort humans to safety, direct rescue crews to access trapped humans, and provide in-situ communication, medication, water and food, and power. The program will develop the requisite human infrastructure of graduate students in mechanical engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, and social psychology. Working together in the interdisciplinary team, students will be exposed to research outside of their respective disciplines and to innovative opportunities for entrepreneurship. A successful smart service system will impact the operations of the public safety sector, and it could be adapted by similar organizations.<br/><br/>The project's objectives include the following: (1) develop and integrate UAS platforms, sensors, imaging and communication systems, and control and path planning algorithms to create a UAS-based smart service system for first response; (2) model the state of humans and infrastructure during a disaster, identify the scene, and create access paths to safety; (3) test prototypes and pursue commercialization opportunities; and (4) educate the public and train first responders on the technology. The translational research to create the UAS-based smart service system will focus on sensor data fusion, scene identification, modeling of the state of humans, infrastructure and their interactions as well as on the platform for testing and evaluating remediation strategies, communication schemes, and access path planning. Understanding of the system aspects will enable first responders and public safety command personnel to analyze and understand on-scene, active emergency situations through interactive, integrated data analysis and visualization; and give them the ability to sense, predict, and act in a variety of disaster scenes and human socio-psychological conditions.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of this project are the University of Nevada at Reno (involving faculty across four departments: mechanical engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, and social psychology); industry partners: two small businesses, Drone America and SpecTIR, companies based out of Reno, Nevada; academic partners: University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and the University of Utah as well as experts from the UNR Seismology Lab and the Washoe County as System users; and broader context partners include the newly established Nevada Advanced Autonomous Systems Innovation Center (NAASIC) at UNR, the state-supported UAS program management office, Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems (NIAS), and the Nevada Industry Excellence (NVIE)."
0.05027,"An award is made to Claflin University for the purchase of an automated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) sample changer to do NMR-based metabolomics research. The field of metabolomics focuses on changes to the small molecules that make up metabolism upon some stressful event or condition. NMR serves as an excellent detector of these small compounds; and statistical analysis is applied to many NMR sample replicates to increase the robustness of the metabolomics technique. The addition of an automated sample changer to Claflin?s existing 700 MHz NMR not only will make metabolomics research more efficient, but also the NMR will be more user-friendly. Specifically, the SampleCaseTM is mounted to the instrument at user height and eliminates the use of a ladder. Undergraduate students will gain more access to collecting NMR data and be trained in cutting-edge NMR-based metabolomics research. Claflin University has the third highest field NMR laboratory in the state of South Carolina, just behind the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the Hollings Marine Laboratory (HML). Although a predominately undergraduate university and HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), Claflin's NMR facility is becoming a state and nation wide shared facility with six collaborative metabolomics projects and plans to secure major users of the instrument from other future collaborative partners. The automated sample changer will enhance the current instrument capabilities, and is in line with the chemistry department's mission to not only become a state level shared NMR facility, but to support and enhance undergraduate research participation. With the addition of an automatic sample changer, Claflin's NMR facility will be more attractive to outside users as well as be able to accommodate multiple undergraduate metabolomics research projects. Housed in the Molecular Science and Research Center (MSRC) on Claflin?s campus, the extraordinary collection of state of the art instrumentation, including the 700 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer, is unmatched by any other HBCU. PI Boroujerdi's laboratory specializes in NMR-based metabolomics research; however, with such a high field magnet, the capability to collect and analyze large bio-molecular samples via NMR is possible and open to any external users.<br/><br/>Claflin undergraduates love NMR-based metabolomics research. PI Boroujerdi is the newest biochemistry faculty member at Claflin, and since the beginning of her tenure three years ago, her metabolomics group has grown exponentially (currently with to 14 undergraduate students, 4 graduate students, and 1 staff). The nature of metabolomics lends itself to collaborations which is ideal for Claflin undergraduates whose research interest are spread far and wide in basic biology research. With 6 collaborators across the nation, and the recent interest in metabolomics research at Claflin, the demand for the 700 MHz NMR has dramatically increased to the point of saturation. With automatic sample collection, the large number of routine one dimensional 1H spectra can be collected more efficiently, and the extremely inefficient personnel time wasted on manual sample insertion and data collection will be refocused on bench work and data analysis, further increasing the quality and quantity of data produced by the metabolomics group. In order to accommodate the increasing number of undergraduates participating in metabolomics research, which includes the requirement for science majors to write and defend a senior thesis prior to graduation, many projects and collaborators have been established, which translates into a large number of NMR samples and a need for more efficient NMR data collection. Sample preparation, interpretation of results, manuscript writing, and presenting results will be increased with the addition of an automated sample changer. Instead of devoting personnel time to manual routine NMR data collection, while data is collected in automation, PI Boroujerdi can devote her time to training undergraduates in metabolite extraction techniques, statistical analysis of NMR data, and combing the literature to understand the biological implications of the metabolomics results."

0.224831,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in development of a new class of amorphous metal alloys that could benefit society as a whole. Theoretical calculations have shown that 90% weight reduction of components can be achieved with Iron-based amorphous and nano-composite alloys. By reducing the weight of components in automotive and aerospace, significant fuel savings can be achieved. Fuel savings will result in both reduced cost as well as reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Another field of application for amorphous ferromagnetic alloys is electromagnetic cores in electrical motors, transformers and filters. Ferromagnetic amorphous alloys allows for reduced energy losses in these applications by up to 80%, which correspond globally to 50 Million tons of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants per year or 1/10 of the nuclear power production per year in the US. Amorphous metal could also have big impact on healthcare. Amorphous metals could address extremely costly metallosis issues currently experienced by the medical implant industry due to recalls and lawsuits.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of metal based additive manufacturing (AM) of Iron-based amorphous metal components. AM processes for alloys with superior mechanical and/or magnetic properties will be developed, and increased scientific understanding of the material mechanisms achieved. While preliminary research show promising results for fabricating larger components with amorphous bulk properties, there are still issues that need to be resolved. To address these challenges, it is important that proper process parameters for forming dense, crack-free, material are established by extensive experimental work using both Electron Beam Melting and Direct Metal Laser Sintering technologies. To support the experimental work, phenomenological Finite Element (FE) models will be developed. The FE models will first be validated through initial experiments and then be used to make informed choices regarding process parameters such as building temperature, part orientation and scanning strategy."
0.371086,"The project aims to find a powerful new route towards exfoliated clay/polymer nanocomposites at high clay loading. A recently discovered self-organizing process is able to disintegrate (exfoliate) clay particles into their individual thin sheets (leaves) when being gently mixed into a suitable polymer. The phenomenon is called self-exfoliation, since no external energy input is required. In the resulting nanocomposite, the clay leaves were found to distribute uniformly throughout the polymer matrix (i.e., random leaves), which can be beneficial for many applications that require high connectivity (mechanical, electrical, and thermal). While such self-exfoliation has great potential as a novel nanocomposite synthesis process, it has not yet been applied due to the lack of a better understanding of the self-exfoliation mechanism. <br/><br/>The planned research has the objective of explaining the origins of the self-exfoliation so that it can be utilized systematically as a new path for creating novel polymer nanocomposites at high loadings of random leaves including graphene. The synergistic expertise of the PI and co-PI will allow a full characterization of the nanocomposite formation. Diverse experimental methods will probe the four relevant length scales of this system. The macro-scale bulk properties and their mechanical evolution during exfoliation, which are most relevant industrially, will be studied through rheology. Rheology will also provide the time scales of the exfoliation dynamics and will guide the other experiments in this way. The micron-scale will be probed with optical microscopy to observe aggregate swelling and the homogeneity and randomness of the final exfoliated state. The nano-scale structure/dynamics will be observed with SAXS (small angle x-ray scattering), USAXS (ultra-SAXS), and SANS (small angle neutron scattering) to monitor clay gallery spacing and a polymer conformation anchored to a clay leaf, and AFM (atomic force microscopy) to test for the presence of an entropic-pulling force from the tethered polymer chains. The bonding at the atomic scale will be probed with NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy to confirm the presence of hydrogen bonds and determine if hydrogen bonds form on the face and/or sides of a clay leaf. The initial part of the research will be guided by hypothesizing two possible self-exfoliation mechanisms and by following up with experiments on several different self-exfoliating clay/polymer systems. <br/><br/>Based on these research findings, other self-exfoliating material combinations (graphene instead of clay; semicrystalline polymers instead of amorphous polymers) and their processing conditions will be explored. Research results from the two research groups will feed into each other and lead to a broad education of graduate and undergraduate students of the two research groups. This includes the co-PI's SAXS/WAXS beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source, which will provide undergraduate/graduate students with an unusually broad perspective on scientific research."
0.04218,"This U.S.-Netherlands project development visit will catalyze new collaboration between the PI's experimental group at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and the theoretical group of Prof. Fred MacKintosh at the VU University, in Amsterdam. Working with the PI's data from experiments on chromosomal/spindle motion during cell division, new theoretical models will be developed jointly to interpret her data and extend UV University's active network models. The goal of the new collaboration is to ceate a bridge going from theoretical models to results with biological implications for advancing our basic understanding of how chromosomes move during cell division. With preliminary results, the partners expect to establish a theoretical and quantitative framework to characterize and help explain the mechanics of the microenvironment of the living cell nucleus. Involvement of one U.S. graduate student in this activity will provide valuable early career research experience with both experimental and theoretical approaches, as well as exposure to a range of biophysical systems and methods, including advanced microscopy. If successful, findings should contribute to our ability to address the challenges currently posed by quantitative intracellular microrheology and prepare a foundation for the U.S.-Netherlands team's longer term research.<br/><br/>Growth in organisms, from embryo to old age, proceeds from cell division. It is a fundamental part of the biology of organisms and obtaining an appropriate model for the motion of chromosomes during the process could help with understanding of this basic event. During research visits to Amsterdam, U.S. experimental results on the nonequilibrium motions of fluorescent probes (in the cell nucleus and in an in vitro minimal model for activity in the nuclear mechanical environment) will be analyzed theoretically. Cooperative efforts will focus on the frequency dependence of the fluctuation enhancement and the dependence on the size scale of the probes, attached to a chromosome locus or spanning the entire spindle. These experiments and theory on the dynamic behavior of condensed DNA in living cells and in vitro could lead to a new way of thinking about the vital motion in living cells and about its role in the way DNA behaves in the nucleus."

These cells are required for sexual reproduction, and when they are improperly formed the outcome is sterility. This project will investigate a critical protein complex in meiosis, named the Synaptonemal Complex (SC), in order to understand how it is formed and stabilized, and what are the factors that affect its structure and function. The project will also offer training opportunities in genetics, the science of heredity, to help develop the next generation of successful scientists and teachers. Students in various stages of their careers will be involved, including high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students. In particular, this project will help address the lack of diversity within STEM disciplines by involving underrepresented minorities in research performed at the University of Iowa. The Iowa Genetics Research program for high-school students in the department of Biology (iGRHB) will expose students to scientific methodologies, experimental design, and data interpretation in an investigation-based lab setting. iGRHB students will be recruited from the Iowa City area, from a local community with a majority of STEM-underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>SC formation is essential for generation of viable egg and sperm cells, and this function is evolutionarily conserved.

These studies will be performed in the multi-cellular organism Caenorhabditis elegans by using a combination of genetic, cytological, molecular, and biochemical tools available for this model system. The first aim will identify the mechanism by which protein modification regulates SC assembly by the prevention of SC aggregation. The second aim will investigate how nuclear transport controls SC assembly and reduces SC protein aggregation. Overall, these studies will provide crucial insights on the mechanisms regulating SC assembly and, therefore, the fundamental biological and genetic processes required for reproduction."
2.967108,"This award provides support for a consortium of three universities to build a custom electronics system called the Fast TracKer (FTK) for the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The FTK will perform global track recognition reconstruction using the innovative technique of massive parallelism. A billion track patterns are pre-stored in custom content-addressable memory (Associative Memory) chips that are being designed. As each hit leaves the detector at full speed, it is simultaneously seen by all patterns. Track fitting is replaced by a linear calculation of the track parameters and the goodness of fit, with nearly offline resolution. With modern electronics, one can fit tracks at a rate of one track per nanosecond. <br/><br/>For the next decade, experiments at the LHC will provide unprecedented opportunities for answering the most important questions in elementary particle physics. Data collected by ATLAS will be used for hundreds of simultaneous analyses to search for the Higgs boson, supersymmetry, large extra dimensions, dark matter, Hidden Valley particles, the carriers of new forces, and other possible new phenomena as well as measure the detailed properties of the top and bottom quarks and the W and Z bosons in an attempt to understand what is beyond the Standard Model. Important discoveries are likely, but determining what the new phenomena are will not be easy. Large numbers of signal events are needed for such measurements, with as little background as possible. Tracking is essential for selecting events containing heavy fermions. At such luminosity, where large occupancy in the tracking detectors greatly increases track reconstruction time, only a small fraction of the events selected by the level-1 trigger could have track reconstruction done. The FTK, on the other hand, does global tracking three orders of magnitude more quickly than software reconstruction. As a result, it will enhance the physics reach for a broad range of ATLAS studies increasing the number of events retained for offline analysis by a factor of ten or more for broad classes of possible new phenomena. This means that if the new physics is dominated by such processes, ATLAS will be able to collect as many signal events in a year with much improved signal-to-background as it would without the FTK in a decade at the same luminosity. <br/><br/>This system is not only crucial for the ATLAS experiment, advancing the physics program of over 3000 scientists world-wide with 600 in the U.S., including over 200 graduate students from 40 institutions, but will also promote innovations in detector technology. The university groups in this proposal have a tradition for involving undergraduate and graduate students in detector development projects and this project will bring unique opportunities for training and teaching modern electronics and computing to a variety of levels of young people. It will be one of the most sophisticated systems built in high energy physics. Under the supervision of professors and engineers, graduate students and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, will collaborate in designing, building, and testing electronic boards, writing the firmware and software, and comparing to simulation - all marketable skills. Two of the five PIs are female thereby promoting diversity. This extremely fast pattern recognition technology that would be developed for the FTK could have a profound impact on all future versions of collider and astrophysics experiments as well as applications to other field such as medical imaging. As an example, in proton computed tomography the pattern recognition technology has the potential to increase data acquisition rates and thus reduce imaging time with improved resolution."
0.147867,"The strength and direction of Earths magnetic field varies in both time and space. These variations are recorded in a variety of geological materials, and by interpreting the records we learn about processes deep in Earth's liquid core (where the field is generated); about how the Earth and our atmosphere have evolved over geologic time; and we can use knowledge of field variations to put age constraints on geologic formations and some archeological artifacts. Although it is relatively easy to recover the direction of Earth's field, it is far more difficult to recover field strength (also known as 'paleointensity'). Typically, laboratory procedures designed to recover paleointensity are only appropriate for very small (less than a few tens of nanometers) magnetic crystals, but these small crystals are rare in nature. Volcanic glass (such as obsidian) is one material in which they are relatively abundant, and previous work has demonstrated that in some cases geologically young volcanic glass accurately records paleointensity. Glass is not a stable material, however, and the glass structure changes over time and with the absorption of water. If the magnetic minerals also change after the initial formation of the glass, they most likely will not provide us with accurate paleointensity information. The proposed work will provide an understanding of how magnetic mineralogy varies with the age and water content of natural glasses and will allow us to evaluate the suitability of natural volcanic glass as a paleointensity recorder over geologic time. In addition to the impact on geoscience disciplines, natural glasses have long been considered an analogue for nuclear waste glasses and other hazardous waste glasses. The proposed work may contribute to our ability to monitor incipient alteration of waste glasses via magnetic properties.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/><br/>Although knowledge of the strength of Earth's magnetic field through time ('paleointensity') is critical in our understanding of field generation and evolution, paleointensity data remain sparse throughout Earth's history. This stems partly from the fact that few natural materials have the required fine-grained (single-domain) mineralogy and are also resistant to alteration both in nature and during laboratory reheating. Natural volcanic glasses, because they are quickly cooled, typically contain single-domain titanomagnetite, and the glass serves to at least partially protect the titanomagnetite against alteration. It has been demonstrated that young (<50-100 ka) submarine basaltic glass can reliably record the field, but it is unclear how the magnetic mineralogy and hence magnetization might change with age as the metastable glass structure relaxes and/or the glass becomes hydrated. Limited studies of more silicic glass (such as obsidian) suggest that it may also reliably record the field, but that devitrification and/or hydration will negatively impact paleointensity estimates. While important questions have been raised regarding the suitability of volcanic glass over geologic time, there has been no attempt to systematically address the issues surrounding glass relaxation, devitrification, and hydration. The objective of the proposed work is to assess the reliability of natural volcanic glasses to recover the intensity of Earth's magnetic field throughout geologic time."
0.202773,"In plants and animals, DNA is packaged and maintained in chromatin fibers. These structures are comprised of nucleosomes, which are made up of nucleic acid molecules wrapped around proteins called histones. Chromatin remodeling factors alter the nucleosome, thereby regulating the overall structure and stability of chromatin fibers, and modulating gene expression. In this project, the effects of two major classes of chromatin remodeling factors will be addressed with state-of-the-art computer simulations. These studies will reveal the physical basis by which cells modulate the structure and dynamics of chromosomes, and how this affects the vital process of gene expression. This project will also expose students throughout the educational system to cutting-edge biophysics research. Introductory and advanced courses will be developed that transcend traditional scientific boundaries and undergraduate and pre-and post-doctoral students will receive hands-on training. This project will increase participation in research for students from underrepresented groups, educate future middle and high school teachers, and provide training to the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Eukaryotes package and maintain their genetic code in chromatin fibers. The fundamental unit of these structures is the nucleosome, a complex of eight histone proteins that wrap ~147 base pairs of DNA. By altering the biochemical properties of the nucleosome, the cell regulates the structure and stability of chromatin and thus influences gene expression. Two of the primary mechanisms by which this occurs are post-translational modifications of histone residues and replacement of canonical histones with histone variants. The effects of these chromatin remodeling factors on the structures and stabilities of nucleosomes have been extensively studied. However, it is only in recent years that it has become evident that chromatin exhibits significant conformational dynamics, the details of which, and how remodeling factors influences them, remain elusive. The goal of this project is to determine how post-translational modifications and histone variants affect intra- and inter-nucleosome dynamics as a means of regulating gene expression. This project will test the hypothesis that chromatin remodeling factors function by creating local perturbations that propagate through allosteric networks to induce global changes in nucleosomes and chromatin fibers. To do this, biomolecular simulations will be performed to address (1) how the local effects of post-translational modifications at dynamic hotspots influence global structures and dynamics, and (2) how the effects of histone variants propagate through inter-nucleosomal dynamical networks into chromatin fibers. This will be done with all-atom and coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations, and will utilize conventional, enhanced sampling, and free energy methods. This work will be performed in close collaboration with experimentalists working in the fields of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering, whose results will help inform, validate, and guide the development of future simulations. This project will significantly expand emerging paradigm that nucleosome functions are closely related to their conformational dynamics and provide insights into the mechanism by which nature modulates multicomponent protein/DNA systems."
0.535328,"This project presents an integrated research and education program to engage undergraduate students in original research on the structure, function and biosynthesis of a class of understudied lipids called headgroup-acylated glycerophospholipids (GPLs) in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Lipids are a key part of living cells and together with other macromolecules such as proteins, they form the membrane that surrounds all cells. Lipids support essential cell functions such as cell division and maintaining the membrane that surrounds and delimits the cell. The two main research objectives are: to understand the functional properties of two proteins that affect headgroup-acylated GPL levels in the cell as well as how levels of headgroup-acylated GPL are regulated in the bacterium; and the impact of changing levels of these lipids on how much the membrane can bend. This work will lay a basis for understanding the function of these minor, yet important, lipids and help, in future work, to explain the complexity of lipids in all cells. A third objective of this project is directly to engage underrepresented students in original research. An innovative program called Diving into Research brings six admitted Vassar College students to campus before the beginning of their freshman year to participate for 4 to 5 weeks in Vassar's 10-week Undergraduate Research Summer Institute. By establishing strong connections with peer and faculty research mentors early on, students from underrepresented groups, including low socioeconomic and first-generation college goers, are placed on a path to success in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)careers.<br/><br/>Throughout this project, undergraduate students will be involved in original research on the structure, function and biosynthesis of a class of understudied lipids called headgroup-acylated glycerophospholipids (GPLs) in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The biosynthesis of lipids, including low abundance lipids such as headgroup-acylated GPLs, affects essential cell functions such as cell division and maintaining cell membrane integrity. Determining the substrate specificity and enzymatic mechanism of two enzymes, PldB and At1g78690, known to impact headgroup-acylated GPL levels in E. coli, and the careful structural determination of these enzymes in vitro products, will provide valuable insights into the basis of each enzyme's unique catalytic mechanisms. Students involved in this project will prepare lipid substrates and protein extracts, perform in vitro enzyme assays, purify enzymes and construct the necessary E. coli strains. In addition, they will employ modern techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry to characterize lipid structure. Understanding the impact of altering headgroup-acylated GPL levels in vivo will yield insights into how headgroup-acylated GPLs affect cell division and the maintenance of membrane integrity. Experiments designed to understand how cells regulate headgroup-acylated GPL levels and how those lipids impact membrane curvature will expose undergraduate researchers to techniques in genetics and cell biology, including mutagenesis and confocal microscopy. This work will yield insight into the biosynthesis and function of this under-investigated class of lipids related to their emerging roles in important cellular processes. This research project, which will influence the field of lipid biochemistry by helping to explain the complexity of lipids in all cells, will positively affect participating undergraduates at Vassar College by expanding their opportunity to engage in substantial research in lipid biochemistry. Every aspect of this research will directly involve undergraduate student researchers. They will present their work at scientific conferences as poster and oral presentations and publish in peer-reviewed journals, setting these students on a path to successful careers in STEM-related fields."
0.171637,"Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) is a cultural keystone species for many Alaska Natives, and is a critical resource in the marine food web for much of coastal Alaska. The appearance of herring in the spring signals the start of the seasonal round after a long winter. Herring is a key dietary resource during this time, but to some, herring is an economic mainstay throughout the year. Alaska Natives, as well as a range of North Pacific species, depend on abundant and geographically widespread populations of herring. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil spill devastated Prince William Sound herring populations in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Thorne and Thomas2008). The southern Gulf of Alaska has been impacted by commercial fishing, habitat degradation, and environmental changes over the past century. Bering Sea communities also depend on herring; in the words of Nelson Islander Louise Kanrilak, ?herring are very important to us. When we are out of herring, we are out of food? (Barker 1993:73). The scientific debate over the status of herring has been complicated by the lucrative commercial sac roe fishery that supplies herring eggs for Asian markets. Local and Traditional Knowledge bearers have witnessed the decline of herring (Thornton et al. 2010a) and many argue that herring are being managed in a depleted state. Alaska Native subsistence fishers and egg-collectors are sounding the alarm, while biologists debate whether herring populations are ?endangered,? ?threatened? or ?struggling? (Carls et al. 2009). Herring have already abandoned some spawning locations (ADFG 2011), and several First Nations in British Columbia have been forced to stop harvesting herring and spawn altogether (Speller et al. 2010).<br/><br/>This project aims to demonstrate how zooarchaeological and paleo-genetic research can be used to understand the dynamics of ancient fishing and fisheries and produce new knowledge that can advance resource conservation today. It will support the development and refinement of new methods of recovering and studying ancient DNA, and will greatly expand knowledge of the long-term history of Alaska Native use of herring. By encompassing the entire range of Pacific herring across Alaska, it will complement current efforts in British Columbia and integrate the knowledge of social scientists, biologists, and Local and Traditional Knowledge bearers. The health of herring is essential to the entire North Pacific marine ecosystem. Archaeological assemblages from across coastal Alaska constitute an unmatched archive of environmental data. This project aims to develop a more complete understanding of the ancient Alaska Native use of herring to better assess the historical abundance, biogeography, and genetic diversity of herring in the past. This effort aims to improve herring fisheries management to benefit a wide range of stakeholders in the Arctic, subarctic, and beyond. The project will gather samples of herring bones from archaeological sites across coastal Alaska for ancient DNA analysis. Preliminary work has shown that ancient mitochondrial DNA can be extracted from herring bones and is well-preserved. Yang and colleagues are working to extract nuclear DNA, which will facilitate comparisons to genetic results emerging from the study of the DNA of extant herring. In this project, ancient DNA from 150 herring bone samples will be studied to establish phylogenetic and geographic relationships. The age of many of these samples is established, but radiocarbon dates will be obtained for those samples lacking dates.<br/><br/>Understanding the temporal context will allow the researchers to identify changes over time. Collaborations between archaeologists, Native communities, biologists, and managers working in BritishColumbia and Washington State will permit region-wide understanding of the ancient use of herring across the North Pacific. The results of the genetic study will be disseminated to six communities in coastal Alaska through a traveling workshop which will leave behind resource materials that can be exhibited and will stimulate further study and engagement in management."
0.202993,"With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF), and EPSCoR programs, Professor Brenton DeBoef from University of Rhode Island and colleagues William Euler, Jimmie Oxley, Brett Lucht and Geoffrey Bothun will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. Additional broader impacts of the proposed instrument will be realized by the hands-on training of advanced chemistry students in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation, the continued growth of chemistry-related research and education at URI, and the outreach between URI Chemistry and its community, including the hosting of an annual, state-wide High School Chemistry contest, and an annual Chemistry Camp for junior high girls.<br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding regioselective oxidative cross-coupling via C?H activation; (b) studying cryptophane-derived molecular probes for hyperpolarized Xenon-129 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (c) discovering new and sensitive methods for the detection of explosives using fluorescence spectroscopy; (d) developing a better understanding of reactions in lithium batteries; (e) investigating organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) processes; (f) studying Clostridium pasteurianum adaptation during crude glycerol fermentation; (g) investigating interactions between engineered nanoparticles and biological membranes; and (h) synthesizing organic macrocycles."
0.078201,"Plate tectonics is the outward expression of the mantle circulation that allows the Earth to get rid of its heat. This convective flow is driven by lateral variations in density induced by changes in temperature and/or composition throughout the mantle. The goal of seismic tomography is to image these lateral variations and it has been quite successful in imaging variations in seismic velocities. Imaging variations in density is much more challenging. One way to do this is to use the splitting and coupling of ""free oscillations"" of the Earth excited by large earthquakes. Such oscillations are analogous to the tones of a bell after it has been struck. Here the PI proposes a novel way to analyze such oscillations of the Earth that will result in better 3D models of the structure of the mantle and so shed light on the forces driving plate tectonics. The construction of 3D models of the Earth also improves our ability to accurately model the propagation of seismic waves. This has many societal implications including an improved ability to estimate seismic hazard, and to monitor a nuclear test ban treaty. <br/><br/><br/>In global seismic tomography, the goal is to image the 3D structure of the Earth in both the mantle and inner core. Currently, images of 3D shear velocity in the mantle are quite robust but images of compressional velocity (or, better yet, bulk sound speed) are less so, and images of 3D density structure still remain controversial. One thing that is clear though is that there is no simple scaling between these parameters in the mantle implying laterally and depth varying causes of the observed anomalies. 3D density structure is not only important for discriminating between possible physical causes of anomalies inside the Earth, but it is this that drives convective flow and so has consequences for determining dynamic topography and the geoid. One of the few ways to get at 3D density structure from a seismic point of view is through the study of free-oscillation splitting and coupling. Here the PI team proposes a modification to the autoregressive technique (AR) by combining it with the Neighborhood Algorithm (NA). The main advantage of the resulting algorithm is that it is not sensitive to the source (which can often be complicated for the large events used in free-oscillation work) but allows direct control over the form of solution so that its robustness can be assessed. The method will be applied to an expanded dataset of 3-component recordings from all major earthquakes in the last 20+ years to study both (effectively) uncoupled multiplets and coupled multiplets so giving constraints on both odd and even structure. The free oscillation structure coefficients so determined will be combined with other types of seismic data to give a more reliable determination of the long-wavelength 3D density structure in the Earth, as well as significantly improving our knowledge of long-wavelength elastic and anelastic structure throughout the Earth."
1.9,"The NSF Sustainable Energy pathways (SEP) Program, under the umbrella of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) initiative, will support the research program of Prof. Levi Thompson and co-workers at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor to develop new non-aqueous redox flow battery chemistries for sustainable energy storage devices. Electricity accounts for ~40% of the energy consumed in the U.S. and most is derived from non-renewable resources including fossil and nuclear fuels. Pathways to greater energy sustainability will require the use of renewable resources. The lack of reliable, low-cost energy storage is one of the key challenges to large-scale integration of renewables, with their intermittency, into the grid. This Sustainable Energy Pathways (SEP) project will deliver the transformative scientific and engineering outcomes needed to demonstrate cost-competitive, non-aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) for grid storage applications. The research has three objectives. Objective 1: Detailed structure-composition-function relationships will be developed for metal beta-diketonate complexes in organic and ionic liquid electrolytes. These relationships will be used to identify the most promising chemistries for characterization of the kinetics and mechanisms at engineered electrodes. Objective 2: The results will be used to design and fabricate small-scale flow cells to evaluate large-scale RFB relevant performance characteristics. Objective 3: An integrated sustainable design and assessment framework will be developed and used to guide the research and evaluate sustainability performance across the electrochemistry, device, and grid integration levels. The results will be compared to those for other storage technologies.<br/><br/>This SEP research project will consider the scientific, technical, environmental, economic, and societal issues associated with energy storage, and establish a new sustainable energy pathway for advancing fundamental battery chemistries to large-scale RFBs for utility scale storage. The students, post-doctoral scholars and other researchers participating in the project will be part of an interdisciplinary team working on technology that address key societal and economic and environmental challenges facing our nation. On completion, they will be well prepared for leadership positions in industry, government, and/or academia.<br/><br/>The chemistries developed in this SEP project will provide the basis for RFBs with an attractive combination of benefits including low cost when compared to other energy storage solutions being considered for grid applications; flexibility in design due to the decoupled energy and power (like fuel cells); simplified thermal management leading to enhanced safety; little or no self-discharge resulting in high efficiencies; and modularity allowing easy scaling, maintenance and modification. The introduction of sustainable, low-cost RFB-based energy storage technologies will improve the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar into the electricity grid and significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants produced from fossil resources including coal and natural gas."
0.505123,"Pattern classification is a fundamental problem in a vast number of applications, ranging from detection of abnormal heartbeats in cardiac patients, to identification of defective chips in microchip manufacturing, to classification of nuclear sources in nonproliferation tasks. The conventional approach to designing classifiers is to leverage training data comprised of labeled examples of the different object classes under consideration. However, a fundamental assumption of standard approaches is that training data are representative of future observations to which the classifier will be applied. In a growing number of applications, including those mentioned above, this assumption cannot be justified because of subject-to-subject variability arising from biological, technological, or environmental factors. In response, this research is developing new fundamental approaches to classification and prediction that adapt trained classifiers to the characteristics of future patterns.<br/><br/>In particular, this research develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for distribution-adaptive prediction and classification. A critical feature of the framework is the use of distributions as predictive features. Several statistical learning problems are studied that incorporate distributions as features; some are generalizations of existing learning problems, while others are new and uniquely motivated by distribution-adaptive problems. General solutions are developed to these problems using the framework of complexity regularization over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Methodological contributions include novel kernels on distributions and new methods of generalization error analysis. The work is concretely motivated by and evaluated in diagnostic applications of flow cytometry, a high-throughput assay for cellular analysis used in the study of blood-related diseases. The research component is complemented by educational initiatives involving graduate, undergraduate, and high school students."
0.713059,"This project is jointly funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry, the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering program.<br/><br/>The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Charles L. Brooks III from the University of Michigan to develop computational methods to explore protein-protein interactions. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) form the basis for most biological processes. An atomic description of the key features of protein-protein interactions will yield tremendous benefits in both establishing a fundamental understanding of the processes that support all living systems, and gaining the ability to manipulate and control those processes. Experimental approaches such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystallography can reveal features of interacting complexes and isolated monomers of key protein-protein interactions, but have difficulty capturing dynamic, flexible systems. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a useful tool to deconvolute these experimental measurements, and offers a detailed, dynamic view of molecular interactions. Although brute force MD approaches have made significant progress studying the dynamics of single molecule systems, they have fundamental difficulties with biologically relevant PPIs due to the large sizes, long time scales and high flexibility of these systems. This project will develop, test and apply computational approaches that enable MD studies to probe the interactions of the viral capsid glycoprotein Hemagglutinin with putative human antibody mimics, and the chaperone activity of the bacterial acid-shock chaperone HdeA. Dr. Brooks will provide training for a postdoc, graduate student and a number of undergraduates as well as mentoring them in the development of physical theories and simulation methods to study protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the findings, methods and techniques developed in this project will be distributed through tutorials and case studies to be integrated into the Multiscale Modeling Tools for Structural Biology (MMTSB) tutorials as well as into courses taught at the University of Michigan <br/><br/>The specific outcome of the project will be computational tools and methods to i) predict environment-dependent NMR observables from coarse-grained (CG) simulations; ii) undertake the development of transferable CG interaction potentials that are specially designed for reproducing observed protein-protein interfaces; iii) undertake the development of enhanced sampling methods for efficient determination of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of intermolecular interactions. The work will focus on two demanding benchmark cases: the interactions of the viral capsid glycoprotein Hemagglutinin with putative human antibody mimics, and the chaperone activity of the bacterial acid-shock chaperone HdeA. The former system is difficult due to the large system size (>600 amino acids total), while the interactions in the latter system are highly dynamic, sensitive to the system pH, and involve multiple copies of HdeA and substrate protein."
0.49821,"Traditional approaches to pattern recognition require access to labeled training data, consisting of known instances of each class under consideration. Such methods are known as ""supervised"" because the training labels are assumed to be correct. In many pattern recognition applications, however, precise label information is difficult or impossible to obtain. This research examines classification tasks involving contaminated training data, wherein training examples for some or all classes of interest are contaminated by examples of other classes. Applications include document classification, nuclear nonproliferation, network intrusion detection, drug design, and image and video annotation. When standard classification algorithms are applied in these settings, suboptimal classifiers result. Unfortunately, there currently exists no satisfactory theoretical or methodological framework that simultaneously addresses such classification problems characterized by contaminated data. <br/><br/>To address this shortcoming, this research develops a novel framework for the decontamination of mutually contaminated probability distributions, together with associated estimation and classification methods. The decontamination strategy involves projecting observed distributions onto the convex hull of other observed distributions, and recovering the true distributions of interest from the residual of this projection. The projection is with respect to a statistical distance known as the separation distance, and under sufficient conditions on the amount of contamination and purity of the underlying class distributions, this projection procedure successfully recovers the class distributions. This in turn facilitates the design of optimal classifiers. The project examines in detail the problems of classification with noisy labels, anomaly detection, crowdsourcing, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, transfer learning, multiple instance learning, and learning from partial labels."

0.44,"Particle accelerators are ubiquitous in society as they are used in particle physics, materials science, structural biology, medicine, and transmutation of nuclear waste. In some cases these accelerators are more than a mile long and cost billions of dollars. If a new cheaper and more compact accelerator technology could be developed, it would transform our ability to use particle accelerators and enable their application to an even wider range of problems of scientific and societal benefit. This research will examine fundamental scientific questions aimed at developing compact particle accelerators based on plasma waves (these are waves moving in fully ionized gases) moving near the speed of light. It will also require generating state-of-the-art software that can be used on the nation's largest computers. The students and post-doctoral researchers trained under this grant will be part of the twenty first century work force in computational science and engineering as well as experts in plasma physics and accelerator physics.<br/><br/>This is an award to perform full-scale three-dimensional numerical experiments of high-intensity particle and laser beam-matter interactions to significantly advance the understanding of basic high-energy density science (HEDS) on ultra intense laser and particle beam plasma interactions. This understanding will aid in the quest to make plasma based accelerator stages for use in high energy physics colliders, next generation light sources, medicine, and homeland security. This work will continue to blend basic research with three-dimensional simulations, including full-scale particle-in-cell modeling of ongoing and planned experiments. High-fidelity full-scale modeling provides the means to extrapolate parameters into regimes that will not be accessible to experiments for years to come.

With this set of tools, the UCLA Simulation of Plasma Group is uniquely positioned to continue to make significant progress towards determining the feasibility of building a compact X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) in the next decade, and a future linear collider based on wakefield sections driven by lasers or particle beams."
0.259999,"With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Frontiera is developing a microscopic imaging technique capable of probing chemical structure on nanometer length scales. Optical microscopes have a limit as to how far one is able to ""zoom in"" on a sample, as the wavelike nature of light limits the resolution to several hundred nanometers. However, many important structures, such as the surface of living cells, have tremendous variation in chemical composition on much shorter length scales. This nanoscale variation leads to wide range of responses in processes such as pharmaceutical binding and cellular signaling. Professor Frontiera's research entails the development and application of an optical microscopy technique that is capable of examining chemical composition on a nanometer length scale. After the successful demonstration of the technique, the researchers plan to probe the response of model cellular membranes to pharmaceutical molecules, in order to understand how nanoscale variation affects function. The educational component of this work is to have students lead the creation of tutorials that are expected to illustrate advanced concepts in spectroscopy and microscopy, to the public. These techniques are increasingly used in fields as diverse as health care, food safety, machining, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. In addition, Professor Frontiera performs in the ""Energy and U"" program, a live outreach show about chemistry performed annually for over 11,000 local elementary students, a majority of whom are minorities currently underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>This research project is focused on the development of a super-resolution Raman imaging technique and its use in determining how nanoscale local environments affect the function of lipid membranes. Current far-field optical microscopies which break the diffraction limit require labeling with fluorophores, and thus, the samples are prone to degradation and the change (as labeling may change the structure or dynamics of the system). Professor Frontiera and her team combine elements of stimulated emission depletion microscopy and femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy to create a broadly useful technique capable of label-free, chemical imaging on nanometer length scales. The femtosecond nature of the technique enables far-field sub-diffraction probing of structural changes on the timescale of nuclear motion. To demonstrate the applicability of label-free super-resolution Raman imaging, Professor Frontiera and her team determine how nanoscale composition and fluidity of supported lipid membranes are affected by the addition of small molecule pharmaceuticals. This nanoscale imaging technique, which is able to probe how environmental heterogeneities affect function, may ultimately be applicable in areas such as biomedicine, pharmaceutical and food safety, photovoltaic and photocatalytic device characterization, and materials science."
0.299917,"Our research program encompasses two different projects. The first project is an experimental search for a long-range interaction between atomic spins and the mass of the Earth. Such an interaction could arise due to a heretofore undiscovered ""fifth force"" or if gravity, as opposed to being a purely tensor interaction as assumed in general relativity, has a scalar/pseudoscalar component. Recent theoretical work has shown that such interactions could be the cause of the accelerating expansion of the universe, commonly attributed to dark energy. Our experiment seeks to detect this effect by simultaneously measuring the spin precession of two isotopes of rubidium using laser spectroscopy. Our experiment aims to improve experimental sensitivity to long-range spin-mass interactions by 1-3 orders of magnitude. Our second project focuses on development of a prototype sensor for the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics (GNOME), an array of geographically separated, time-synchronized ultrasensitive atomic comagnetometers that will search for correlated transient signals heralding new physics. The GNOME would be sensitive to nuclear and electron spin couplings to various exotic particles and fields. To date, no such search has ever been carried out, making the GNOME a novel experimental window on new physics. A specific, feasible example of new physics detectable with the GNOME, presently unconstrained by astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments, is a network of domain walls of light pseudoscalar fields.<br/><br/>Our present understanding of fundamental physics is confronted by a number of deep mysteries: the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, the nature of dark energy, and the nature of dark matter. Our experiments, conducted in laboratories on Earth, use precise measurements of atomic spins to test several hypotheses that might explain these mysteries. It has been proposed that if our present theory of gravity is incomplete, additional components of gravity could both generate the dark energy pushing the universe apart and produce an excess of matter over antimatter after the Big Bang. These additional components of gravity would also cause atomic spins to precess in the Earth's gravitational field, the effect for which our experiment will search. A possible explanation of dark matter is a network of invisible galactic-scale ""domain walls"" that store considerable mass and energy. These invisible domain walls would exert a small torque on atomic spins that could be detected when the Earth passes through a wall. We are building a prototype sensor sensitive to such torques from domain wall-crossing events. An array of time-synchronized sensors based on our prototype will search for transient signals of astrophysical origin heralding such new physics. Our research is being carried out at a public undergraduate institution with a diverse student body, providing hands-on experience in state-of-the-art experimental physics to many undergraduate students (including a significant number of women and underrepresented minorities)."

0.605974,"Non-technical Summary<br/>This DMREF research program aims to formulate an integrated computational materials science and engineering (ICMSE) approach and, consequently develop tools, to accelerate the development of new types of alloys that most likely will have been missed by the traditional trial-and-error method. This effort is an integral part of the national efforts under the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) and the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) initiative. The successful implementation of these new methodologies and design strategy for materials R&D will have a profound impact on industrial exploitation of new materials and optimization of existing ones. The provision of such ICME tools, applicable to an important class of widely applicable structural materials, will have a marked impact on a broad range of advanced technological areas including aerospace, transportation and energy. Because future materials R&D activities, requiring substantially reduced time and cost cycles, must integrate computational materials research with critical experiments, the proposed program will directly prepare graduate students to immediately contribute to the success of ICMSE in industry. Additionally, the proposed training programs for researchers involved in materials development will accelerate the implementation of the new methodology in industry, resulting in very much increased effectiveness of our materials technologists. Regarding educational outreach, the present DMREF program encourages high school students with diverse ethnic backgrounds to enter science and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>This research program involves the integration of sophisticated computational models, at multiple scales, highly advanced materials characterization techniques, and combinatorial and accelerated methods for materials processing and property evaluation. Such a unique coupling will undoubtedly raise significantly the state-of-the-art in the discovery and development of new structural materials. Regarding the targeted material system involved in the proposed program, i.e. titanium alloys, the focus is on the exploitation of recently discovered non-conventional transformation pathways. Thus, recent theoretical and experimental investigations suggest possibilities of achieving extremely fine and uniform alpha+beta microstructures exhibiting substantially improved properties through these non-conventional transformation pathways including pseudo-spinodal decomposition and precursory phase separation. Using an integrated computational materials science and engineering (ICMSE) approach, the development of next generation of Ti alloys based on these new and promising transformation mechanisms will be accelerated. For the first time, alloy development will be led by computational modeling, mechanistically informed and validated by critical experiments involving novel combinatorial methods for materials processing and state-of-the-art characterization techniques. The focus is on Ti alloys for structural applications in a broad range of advanced technological areas including aerospace, transportation and energy (petrochemical and nuclear). The outcomes will lead to a microstructure simulator, a property simulator, and an alloy design simulator for titanium alloys. An additional exciting aspect of this program is that the development and application of this new methodology is expected to result in new science in alloy design."

0.3,"1264721 - Prorok<br/><br/>Conventional culture and susceptibility tests continue to remain the ?gold standard? for identifying pathogens in clinical and other settings. Many new pathogen detection approaches have aimed at replacing this standard by providing more rapid, more accurate and less expensive detection. Very promising techniques such as PCR, surface enhanced Raman, and others have proven adept at pathogen detection, but end users have not warmed up to their expense, extensive sample preparation and skill set necessary to perform them. The field continues to search for a rapid, sensitive, and specific detection technology that is cost-effective and easy to use. The proposed work aims to develop such a biosensor based on magnetic resonance relaxation switching. The method leverages a large body of work involving nanoscale contrast agents employed in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. The aim here is to develop a detection approach that mimics the human immune response to an invading pathogen, the release of 109 to 1012 specific antigens to guarantee quick contact with the pathogen. This proposed technique will employ magnetic nanoparticle contrast agents conjugated with specific capture agents to achieve a similar contact goal. Detection of the species will involve monitoring the average relaxation time (T2) of water protons in the solution, which is highly sensitive to the concentration and distribution of the magnetic nanoparticles present. With multiple nanoparticles attaching to each individual target species their distribution will be altered, and correspondingly, the average proton relaxation time will change. Although, this method leverages well established principles of NMR imaging, this measurement can be accomplished with a simple hand-held relaxometer. <br/><br/>Content in layman?s terms<br/>This proposal will develop new ways to detect bacteria and other pathogens in food or bodily fluids. This technology will use magnetic particles whose magnetic properties will change in predictable ways upon binding of bacteria. The authors envision being able to detect multiple bacteria using sets of unique magnetic nanoparticles."

0.298898,"1235863<br/>Wagner<br/><br/>A challenging scientific and engineering problem is accurately predicting the flow of complex fluids containing solid particles, such as nanoparticles, colloids, crystals and larger particulates. Such suspensions are encountered in a wide array of consumer products (e.g. paints, cosmetics, and foods), in nature (e.g. sediments, concentrated protein solutions and blood), as well as multiphase fluids of significant national concern (e.g. transuranic tank sludge), and as critical components in emerging devices for energy storage (flow batteries). The flow of such suspensions are often thixotropic, whereby the material's rheological properties are time and flow history dependent. The proposed research addresses this challenge though a transformative approach, namely developing a multiscale microstructure-based framework that will be thermodynamically consistent and generally applicable for all flows. A key component will be to identify the internal variables that properly define the microstructure. Validation of the theory and modeling will be accomplished by leveraging a complementary development of new experimental techniques to simultaneous measure the rheology and microstructure of such systems. Thus, a systematic, combined theoretical/experimental investigation on well-defined, model thixotropic systems is an important component of the research plan. The intellectual merits of the research include the development of a robust, theoretically rigorous framework for modeling the general, time dependent flow of concentrated suspensions. This systematic and integrated effort will lead to a new capability in the modeling and understanding of complex thixotropic systems that can significantly aid in the rational engineering of many materials of industrial and national importance. The broader impacts of this work include educating PhDs and BCHEs in suspension rheology necessary for careers in industry and academic research. Modules are to be developed for K-12 education by building on and improving current laboratory demonstrations. The models and knowledge developed in this research have potential to improve many industries as the processing and flow of thixotropic suspensions is critical to chemicals, materials, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and handling.

Furthermore, galaxy formation is hierarchical - small things like dwarf galaxies merge to become bigger things, and eventually, objects like our galaxy. Ms. Naiman's research will use three dimensional simulations of gas to model how stars will form in small astrophysical systems in order to determine both how these objects became what we observe today, and how their star formation histories could have affected the amount of stars which formed in our larger Milky Way galaxy. In addition to her research efforts Ms. Naiman will grow several outreach activities in which she currently participates. She will continue teaching STEM classes to inmates through the Prison Education Project, bring together groups of scientists and artists to visualize complex astrophysical simulations for the education and enjoyment of the public, and will continue teaching and mentoring students.<br/><br/>Ms. Naiman will carry out a theoretical investigation, chiefly involving numerical simulations, aimed at understanding the mass supply conditions required for triggering star formation, with an emphasis on processes occurring at large scales in both galaxies and star clusters.

0.224986,"The Fukushima nuclear disaster was an awakening moment for robotics. Despite years of research and a wide range of robots, performing tasks like turning valves and attaching hoses, could not be done. If such tasks were executed in the earliest stages of the accident, much of the aftermath could have been averted. The fact that radiation levels were too high, forced rescue workers to wait and the disaster grew. Power plants and industrial sites are human-centered environments that are often characterized by doors, hatches, stairs and ladders that need to be entered or climbed. Additionally such environments feature valves, hoses and switches that need to be manipulated and connected. Robots however are not mature enough to efficiently function and effectively operate in such environments. <br/><br/>This 3-year IRES project partners American and Korean roboticists who respectively have expertise in the software and hardware design of humanoids.

Such service and mitigation by robots demands the coupled development of software and hardware where the robot?s form must follow its function. <br/><br/>The project?s intellectual merit stems from the formulation of a unified algorithmic framework. Current humanoids have the form to mimic a person?s motions but lack the software to function and operate in human-centered environments.

0.178,"Dr. Sergio Dieterich is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Brown dwarfs are objects that never acquired enough mass during their formation to attain the internal temperature and pressure necessary to ignite the sustained nuclear fusion of hydrogen, which is the hallmark of a stellar object. Understanding the boundary between very low mass stars and brown dwarfs has deep implications for the search for life in the Universe. It is likely that life may evolve on planets orbiting stars but it is more difficult for life to evolve on brown dwarf systems due to their constantly changing temperature. Dr. Dieterich studies trends in temperature, radius, and luminosity of objects near the stellar/substellar boundary. His thesis work identified a stellar and a substellar population based on these trends. This work will now be extended to a larger sample of stars, and will explore how chemical compositions for different stars change this boundary. Dr. Dieterich will use his experience as a former middle and high school physical science teacher to facilitate the integration of astronomy in the high school physics curriculum. He will compile an activity book that will serve as a resource for physics teachers who wish to enrich their classes by illustrating physical concepts with examples from astronomy. <br/><br/>Dr. Dieterich will address the following three scientific questions during his fellowship: (1) What is the luminosity function at the stellar/substellar boundary? (2) How does metallicity affect the properties of objects with masses close to the hydrogen burning minimum mass? and (3) How can we use objects with known dynamical masses to create a more robust and detailed Mass-Luminosity Relation at the stellar/substellar boundary? The unique resources of Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile are key to answering these questions. Because an accurate distance measurement is essential for establishing luminosity and radius, Dr. Dieterich and collaborators will use the Carnegie Astrometric Planet Search Camera (CAPSCam) on the du Pont 2.5 meter telescope to determine precise trigonometric parallaxes so as to make the study sample volume-complete. Several Las Campanas telescopes will also be used to obtain optical photometry for these very faint objects, which is necessary for calculating bolometric fluxes. Metallicities for the sample will be established through spectroscopic observations done with the Magellan 6.5 meter telescopes. The MagAO adaptive optics system on the Magellan II telescope is one of the only ground based systems capable of obtaining diffraction-limited images in optical wavelengths. This unique capability will be used for the photometric characterization of stars in close binary systems for which dynamical masses are known. The resolved optical photometry will then be used to determine luminosity and effective temperature for these stars, therefore populating the mass-luminosity relation."
0.08,"This award funds the research activities of Senior Research Scientist George T. Fleming of Yale University, who is co-spokesperson of the Lattice Strong Dynamics (LSD) collaboration. In 2012, physicists from around the world working on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) announced the discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson, for which the Nobel prize was awarded the following year. As theoretical particle physicists applaud the discovery, they are also quite confused that no new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) was discovered along with the Higgs boson. So, it remains a mystery how the Higgs boson avoids the effects of quantum gravity, which would make it much heavier than has been observed. This mystery could be solved if the Higgs boson turned out to be a composite particle in much the same way as protons and neutrons are composites made of quarks and gluons, rendering it immune to the effects of quantum gravity. There has been no direct evidence that such a composite scalar could exist until recently, when the LatKMI group of the Kobayashi-Maskawa Institute in Nagoya, Japan announced the first calculation of a light composite scalar consistent with the Higgs boson. As leader of the LSD collaboration, Dr. Fleming is working to confirm this scenario by repeating and improving upon the calculation of the LatKMI group. Lattice gauge theory (LGT) calculations of many physical observables essentially involve extracting exponentially decaying signals from noisy time series data generated in Monte Carlo simulations. Many other scientific fields, e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, signals processing, share common challenges in data analysis of exponential time series. Undergraduates often choose this research topic because the skills they learn remain useful even if they don't continue to work on LGT later in their careers.<br/><br/>The LSD collaboration has begun generation of SU(3) gauge configuration ensembles with eight flavors of Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation. This strongly-coupled gauge theory has long been proposed as a candidate for Walking Technicolor. The calculation of the LatKMI group has shown that the theory contains a surprisingly light scalar particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Calculating the mass of this scalar particle is particularly challenging so the LatKMI result has rather large statistical errors. The LSD collaboration, with access to the Vulcan BG/Q supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL), can improve upon the existing calculation with improved statistics, larger physical volumes and smaller quark masses. This improved calculation will be a stringent test of whether this light scalar particle can be a viable composite Higgs candidate."
0.729,"The intellectual merit of this work is that it measures high-energy neutrino production in the universe and tests the standard model of particle physics thus increasing our fundamental knowledge of the high-energy universe. The origin of the highest energy cosmic-rays is one of the most compelling mysteries in modern physics. Air shower detectors have observed events with energies up to 3x10^20 electron volt (eV). However, despite decades of work, their sources, nuclear composition and acceleration mechanisms remain unknown. Some possible sources include active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursters, and/or supernova remnants. Observation of astrophysical neutrinos will tell us that hadrons must be accelerated in these sources; the neutrino flux and spectrum will significantly constrain theoretical models. <br/><br/>This award will support a search for the diffuse flux of neutrinos produced in these cosmic accelerators, using data from the recently completed IceCube detector. The work will be in two areas. The first is to search for a diffuse flux of electron and tau neutrinos. The group has demonstrated the power of using the outer strings and the top and bottom of IceCube to veto entering muon tracks by using it to measure the atmospheric electron neutrino flux from 50 gigaelectronvolt (GeV) to 10 teraelectronvolt (TeV). They will extend this technique to neutrinos with energies from 10 TeV up to ~ 1 petaelectronvolt (PeV). They will also search for a diffuse flux of high-energy tau neutrinos, through their distinctive topology - two separated cascades. Second, they will use these neutrinos to make a measurement of the neutrino-nucleon cross-section at an energy around 50 TeV - by measuring neutrino absorption in the Earth. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The observation of extra-terrestrial neutrinos will have broad significance for astrophysics. The observation of hadronic accelerators in the universe would answer one of the 11 questions posed in the National Research Council study on the Physics of the Universe: ""Where do ultra-high energy particles come from"" The Education and Outreach component will communicate this forefront research to students and the general public, through presentations at elementary through high schools and public lectures."

5.0,"Alabama A&M University in Normal, Alabama will initiate a Center for Forest Ecosystem Assessment (CFEA) as a 5-year Center for Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST: Phase II). The Center renews a previous project, funded as HRD-0420541. Al-AMU is one of the few Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) with a doctoral program in natural resources and environmental sciences, and the renewal of this CREST program will serve to maximize NSF?s investment in long term ecological research and for increasing minority presence in natural resource professions. The goal for the Phase II of the CFEA is to enhance and expand the effort at Al-AMU to be the leading research Center in forest ecosystem ecology and assessment in the southern Cumberland region, educating future natural resource scientists, particularly from groups that are currently underrepresented in the sciences, expanding the temporal and spatial database for long-term climate change study, and enhancing faculty capacity and intra-and inter-institutional collaborations to make CFEA self-sustaining in the future. <br/><br/>Long-term forest ecosystem research and assessment can provide important ecological insights and are crucial for improving management of ecosystems and natural resources. The underlying research theme is to systematically and synergistically examine the relationship between forest disturbances and the forest ecosystem dynamics, at the temporal scale from immediate to long-term responses, at a spatial scale from individual genetic makeup to landscape patterns and process, at non-living level from carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to ecosystem processes such as carbon balance and storage, and at the biological level from individual wildlife behavior to biodiversity, community dynamics, and ecosystem services. The Center is organized into three subprojects: (1) Ecological Community Responses and Dynamics, (2) Ecosystem Functions and Processes, and (3) Coupled Dynamics of Human and Landscapes. The participants will emphasize inter- and trans-disciplinary synergies and continue to enhance the research productivity of individual faculty and expand the presence of students historically underrepresented in natural resource sciences.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The proposed Center will build upon the accomplishments of the first CFEA funding period to examine the relationships between forest disturbances and the ecosystem dynamics that occur over scales from the molecular to the regional. The research will improve the knowledge of disturbance ecology under changing environment and climate, and will contribute significantly to the disciplines of forest management, restoration ecology and conservation biology. The work will involve a number of agencies, from federal through local communities. The investigators and their students will have access to an uncommonly large scale field ecological experiment, and the results will have direct impact on forest ecosystem management practices.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>Al AMU has a strong record of preparing underrepresented minority students, particularly African Americans, for STEM careers, including advanced degree education. During the previous 5-plus years of the CFEA, 25 faculty members (more than 60% minorities), 35 graduates (awarded 20 MS and 7 PhD, more than 70% minority), 100 undergraduates and 35 high school students have been involved in the research. Continuation of the project will contribute substantially to increase the ethnic diversity of natural resource scientists serving society. The project will support the first professionally accredited Forestry Program at a Historically Black College or University as well as one of the few doctoral programs in natural resources and environmental sciences at an HBCU. The renewal project will involve significant outreach into communities and high schools to enhance recruitment and public awareness of environmental issues, especially in the Southern Cumberland Plateau Region that comprises parts of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. The collaborations with federal and local agencies, as well as private landowners, will benefit the research efforts, establish future sustainability for the CFEA, and help to promote ecologically sustainable resource management practices."
0.200123,"Salt rock is used for secure storage of oil, high-pressure gas, and nuclear waste because of its ability to creep and form barriers to gas and fluid flow. However, creep processes near subsurface storage facilities can lead to crack debonding, opening, closure and rebonding that compromise the integrity of flow barriers and stability of engineered structures. Mathematical descriptions of cracking and healing are incompletely developed. This award will support fundamental rock physics and mechanics research to link deformation by crack debonding, opening and rebonding to microstructures and mechanical variables that govern the time-dependent behavior of salt rock over geological space and time scales. Deformation of salt occurs rapidly at laboratory conditions making it a good analog to study damage and healing in other crystalline materials and porous media. Project findings are expected to advance quantitative relations enabling accurate modeling and prediction of behaviors in engineering projects. The work will advance fundamental understanding of cracking and healing in other rocks that deform by the same processes, especially around earthquake faults and zones of induced seismicity. The team of geoscience and engineering researchers will collaborate with other programs to broaden the participation of women and other under-represented groups in research and engineering.<br/><br/>Most continuum damage models for salt are based on the concept of dilatancy boundary, and do not account for crack-induced anisotropy of elastic properties. Micro-mechanics and homogenization principles were successfully employed to model salt rock elastoplastic behavior, but were not used to test scale invariance of microstructure to transitions in deformation regimes. The goal of this project is to link salt deformation regimes and rheological behaviors with the density and orientation distribution of microstructures. Deformation regimes at the scale of a Representative Elementary Volume will be decomposed into independent processes (e.g., cracking), each related to different microstructure descriptors (e.g., grain aspect ratio). Macroscopic thermodynamic variables will be formally related to the microstructure descriptors to test the space and time scale invariance of transition points in deformation regimes. Specific research objectives are to: (1) Identify topological components and subcomponents of salt microstructure; (2) Determine the energy cost of intra- and inter-granular crack debonding, opening, closure and rebonding; (3) Compute energy thresholds associated with transitions between deformation regimes at the grain and REV scales; (4) Test the time and scale dependence of microstructure organization during transitions; (5) Design rock salt microstructural systems that optimize healing properties in subsurface storage environments."
0.137763,"Recent rare events with disastrous economic and social consequences, so-called Black-Swan events, have made today's world far different from just decades ago. Examples of these events range from earthquakes and nuclear crises to the collapse of financial market from sub-prime mortgages. All of these intensify the need for risk management among the insurance and financial industry, and in particular, the invention of new tools to model, analyze, predict, and manage extreme risks. The investigators will undertake the fundamental challenges posed by the study of rare events: they, by nature, are short of data, their likelihood is difficult to compute, and that they are difficult to reflect via accurate models. As such, the investigators will take an integrated approach that combines statistical methods, probabilistic analysis, optimization, and efficient computer simulation to assess their risks. The research has potential for high societal impact, given the wide range of applications of the models and methods documented in the project for handling the important implications of extreme events. The investigators plan to train several Ph.D. students and will also involve them in K12 education as guest lecturers via Harlem Schools Partnership with Columbia University. The investigators will attempt to recruit high-quality personnel from under-represented groups. They will also disseminate the scientific output of this project via open access sites.<br/><br/>The intellectual strength of the project rests on the fact that it includes algorithmic, computational, statistical, and theoretical components. The goal is to establish a robust and systematic approach for modeling and analyzing extreme risks in insurance and finance. The investigators systematically combine: a) the theory of extreme value statistics, b) asymptotic analysis in probability, c) stochastic optimization, and d) highly efficient Monte Carlo techniques. Specific objectives include: 1) establishing a robust asymptotic theory to account for tail events uniformly over a wide range of settings, 2) taking advantage of the asymptotic large deviations theory to build provably efficient Monte Carlo estimators for rare events, and 3) investigation of a robust optimization approach that accounts for model misspecification. The investigators' approach is both innovative and necessary because the nature of rare events exposes deficiencies in each of these areas: i) The theory of extreme value statistics assumes a large number of data points to provide accurate estimators but the nature of rare events precludes this assumption. ii) Asymptotic analysis techniques allow to obtain formulas that are easily evaluated and thus amenable to sensitivity analysis under a wide range of model parameters. So, asymptotics may help mitigate some of the statistical error issue, but unfortunately, they carry an unmeasurable error and often lose important information. iii) Efficient Monte Carlo has a controlled error by sampling, but it still assumes a model in place and could lead to incorrect conclusions in case the model is incorrect. iv) Optimization techniques might help mitigate the problem of model uncertainty by computing bounds for the probabilities of interest, optimizing over the selection of models that cover the truth with high confidence. However, these might be too loose to be practical or the optimization problem could be too complex, thus the need from 1) to 3). Overall, the investigators will establish a comprehensive approach that resolves the deficiencies exposed by each of the aforementioned segregated methods."
0.189532,"The goal of this project is to develop a versatile device that probes quantum properties of small diatomic molecular ions (particles composed of two atoms that have lost one or more electrons). The singly charged hydrogen molecular ion (two protons, bound together by a single electron) is a simple but fundamental example of such an ion. Diatomic molecular ions are important because they are abundantly found in space, and might also briefly exist in other settings, including living organisms. The mechanism binding the two atoms is very similar to a coiled spring, allowing the atoms to move one with respect to the other without going astray. According to the basics of Quantum Mechanics, a diatomic molecular ion is continually vibrating in a range of discrete quantum states at different temperatures, which are defined by integers that state the degree of vibration on a given scale for which the bigger the integer, the stronger the pulsation. The proposed device probes these discrete states and is comparable to a thermometer reading a low temperature for a cold object and high temperature for hot one. It will also provide data that will help to understand how the vibrational states affect their environment during interaction with other particles. Not well understood, these slow interactions, technically called low energy interactions, are known to play important roles in the interstellar medium, in the cold part of nuclear fusion plasmas, and in the processes of DNA strand breaks, etc. Thus, this project will promote the progress of science and may have implications to a broad spectrum of areas of importance to society; at the same time, it will give participating undergraduate students the opportunity to take part in the development of a sophisticated 3-D imaging device at their own institution.<br/><br/>The charge transfer in collisions between hydrogen and diatomic molecular ions touches a variety of disciplines spreading from physical science to life science. First of all, it is of foremost importance in fundamental physics because it involves the smallest atom. It is also one of the dominant reactions in environments such as the cold divertor plasma regions of a fusion tokamak or in interstellar clouds where the main constituents are neutral H, the positive hydrogen ion, and H-molecules. Moreover, understanding of this simplest fundamental system is a key for mastering more complex systems which exist in, e.g., biophysics where radical attacks on biomolecules such as DNA potentially involve charge transfer at very low energy. However, it is often almost impossible to compare laboratory measured cross sections to existing theories and calculations because the vibrational state distribution of the molecules is not known. The proposed 3-D imaging device will ultimately improve previously measured absolute cross section measurements by making them vibrationally resolved, enabling a more detailed comparison between theoretical and experimental results. In this 3-D imaging technique, the molecular ion undergoes a resonant dissociative charge exchange with an alkali atom and releases its vibrational energy in the form of kinetic energy of the two fragments. The detection of the positions of the daughter particles and their flight time differences made possible with the detectors allows the reconstruction of the molecular ion's initial vibrational energy via simple dynamics. This detection technique is equivalent to taking a time resolved snapshot picture of the molecular ion fragments (thus the name 3-D imaging). The whole 3-D imaging apparatus is envisioned to be a portable device which could be easily transported to and used at a variety of research facilities."
0.374998,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Case Western Reserve University will collaborate with the University of Birmingham, UK, on novel methods of engineering the surface of structural alloys, including austenitic stainless steel, Ni-Cr, and Co-Cr alloys. Both groups have carried out extensive prior work, which revealed that infusing interstitial solutes - carbon or nitrogen - from the alloy surface at low temperature effectively suppresses the precipitation of second phases and enables the formation of an approximately 25 micrometer thick homogeneous, precipitate-free hard shell (""case"") with carbon or nitrogen concentrations that can exceed the equilibrium solubility limit by about 100,000 times (!). Such colossal supersaturation with interstitial makes the surface up to 5 times harder, increases the wear resistance and the fatigue life by about 100 times, and elevates the corrosion resistance to that of the most corrosion-resistant alloys. The new project will focus on the hitherto unexplored reliability and lifetime of these unusual non-equilibrium materials at elevated temperature and under applied mechanical stress. A second thrust the project is to explore the possibility actually using controlled thermal post-processing for further improving the alloy surface properties and durability. Under the high driving force for precipitation it should be possible to generate an ultrafine dispersion of second-phase particles, which is expected to further improve hardness without compromising corrosion resistance. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The usefulness of austenitic stainless steel and related structural alloys for a broad variety of technical applications can be dramatically improved by exposing finished parts of these materials to a process that infuses carbon or nitrogen atoms into their surface. Such ""case hardening"" was already applied to arms in the middle age. However, while improving the surface hardness, the conventional way in which it was carried out it compromises other properties, e.g. the resistance against damage from repeated loading or chemical impact from the environment. Recently, new concepts have been developed that overcome these limitations. It has been demonstrated that appropriately conducted surface infusion of carbon or nitrogen at low temperature actually dramatically improves all alloy properties because by providing very high concentrations of carbon/nitrogen while suppressing the precipitation of carbide or nitride particles. However, this leaves the alloy in a non-equilibrium state, and hardly anything is known to date about the durability, lifetime, and temperature stability of alloys treated in this way. Moreover, a great potential seems to exist for transforming the non-equilibrium state into one providing further improved alloy properties by tempering the material after the infusion of carbon or nitrogen. Case Western Reserve University will collaborate with another leading group in this field at the University of Birmingham, UK, to develop a fundamental scientific understanding of these highly technologically relevant aspects. This is of great importance for many applications of surface-engineered structural alloys, e. g. for bearings, food processing blades, valves, dies, nuclear reactor components, medical implants, and surgical and dental instruments.<br/><br/>The project is supported by the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures program and the Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research."

0.823281,"Natural fractures act as major heterogeneities in the subsurface that controls flow and transport of subsurface fluids and chemical species. Their importance cannot be underestimated, because their transmissivity may result in undesired migration during geologic sequestration of CO2, they strongly control heat recovery from geothermal reservoirs, and they may lead to induced seismicity due to fluid injection into the subsurface. Advanced computational methods are critical to design subsurface processes in fractured media for successful environmental and energy applications. This project will address the following key BIG data and computer science challenges: (1) Computation of seismic wave propagation in fractured media; (2) BIG DATA analytics for inferring fracture characteristics; (3) High Performance Computation of flow and transport in fractured media; and (4) Integration of data from disparate sources for risk assessment and decision-making. This will enable design of technologies for addressing key societal issues such as safe energy extraction from the surface, long-term sequestration of large volumes of greenhouse gases, and safe storage of nuclear waste. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a team of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Outreach to high schools teachers and minorities through a planned workshop will inspire interest in environmental green-engineering, mathematics, and computational science.

0.7,"Single-celled organisms, such as protists and bacteria, inhabit fluctuating environments where nutrient availability isn't always guaranteed. To cope with this ""feast or famine"" uncertainty, cells have evolved processes that allow them to respond appropriately by growing and dividing when nutrients are present (proliferation), or by becoming dormant and adopting an energy-conserving state when starved (quiescence). This project utilizes a single-celled reference organism, the green alga Chlamydomonas, to investigate how molecular switches that govern proliferation and quiescence are controlled and how they are coordinated to ensure that they don't interfere with each other. Microorganisms like these can accumulate large quantities of valuable compounds, e.g. oils, but only when starved. It is anticipated that knowledge about the molecular switches governing transitions between the states of proliferation and quiescence will allow predictions about how these states can be controlled and engineered. Thus, newly discovered details about these molecular switches provide potential engineering strategies to uncouple high yields of valuable compounds from starvation responses. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the two research locations will collaborate to identify and model the interactions between key regulators of quiescence and proliferation that have counterparts in many other species including plants and animals. The diversity of approaches and quantitative training components prepare the trainees for science careers in industry or academia. <br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to gain a predictive understanding of how nutrient and metabolic cues are integrated into coherent decisions that control life cycle state transitions. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two nuclear protein complexes, CHT7-C and RB-C, have been identified that govern the transitions between nutrient-deprivation induced quiescence, cell growth, and commitment to cell division. It is hypothesized that the quiescence regulator CHT7-C, and the cell cycle commitment regulator RB-C form an interlocking transcriptional network that coordinately controls cell growth and division responses to nutrient or metabolic cues. The objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize purified CHT7-C and RB-C complexes in order to define their subunit composition and modifications under different life cycle states; (2) Identify CHT7-C and RB-C target genes followed by generation of a transcriptional network model to observe common nodes that functionally couple the two complexes; (3) combine mutations affecting different components of the two complexes into isogenic lines to obtain synthetic phenotypes that provide insights into function and interrelation of the two complexes in vivo; and (4) build a testable logic switch model and develop quantitative markers to test and revise the model. The collaborative approach taken for studying the interactions between quiescence and cell proliferation regulators is aimed at transforming the understanding of the networks that establish and maintain coordinated global responses to metabolic and nutritional cues."
0.019818,"Kinetic equations arise as fundamental models in many applications such as rarefied gas dynamics, plasma physics, nuclear engineering, semiconductor device design, traffic networking, and swarming. Due to the high-dimensionality of such models, conventional numerical partial differential equation (PDE) solvers will incur prohibitive computational cost, limiting their applications to real-world problems. This research project aims at addressing this issue by developing discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods by the sparse grid approach. The resulting schemes enjoy the excellent properties that the traditional DG methods offer, while still being able to achieve high-order accuracy with a significant reduction in the required degrees of freedom. The research will have direct impact on the efficient and robust computations of kinetic equations and on other application areas involving high-dimensional PDEs. The research plan is complemented by educational and outreach activities involving the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, and fostering collaborations among female researchers in computational mathematics. <br/><br/>The research plan consists of several coherent projects, ranging from algorithm design, analysis, and implementation to application. In particular, the investigator plans to perform detailed studies of sparse tensor product polynomial spaces and to construct DG methods on sparse grids for model equations. The methods will be further developed for kinetic equations with attention to numerical challenges specific to Vlasov and Boltzmann equations. The PI will also develop similar numerical schemes for PDEs arising from areas such as optimal control and mathematical finance. Theoretical issues including stability, conservation, and error estimates, and computational issues including efficient linear solvers, adaptivity, and parallel implementations will be explored. The educational goals of this project are to develop a pipeline for the recruitment, retention, and early research exposure of undergraduate students, to continue integrated training and mentoring of graduate students and postdocs, and to promote collaborations and build a network of support for early career female researchers.

2.839083,"The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles; Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one possibility. Evidence for WIMPs that could constitute dark matter may come from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or from sensitive astronomical instruments that detect radiation produced by WIMP-WIMP annihilations in galaxy halos. The orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for research and development steps to support DarkSide-G2, a second-generation (""G2"") direct WIMP search using a liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with an active mass of 3.3 tons. Liquid argon is a promising medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. This is one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors, and when combined with the measurement of ionization, background rejection is even further enhanced. The performance of a ton-scale or larger liquid argon TPC would be limited by the high rate of 39-Ar beta decays if atmospheric argon was used. DarkSide-G2 will use argon collected from underground sources which has been shown to have 39-Ar content lower than atmospheric argon by at least a factor of 150. These funds will allow the groups to carry out the detailed mechanical design work necessary to ensure the functionality of the detector, develop necessary high voltage and data acquisition elements, and develop and identify the extremely radiopure detector components and techniques necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer a continuing opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute a cutting-edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the LNGS-South Dakota-Princeton summer school for high school students."

By absorbing small molecules into stretched or compressed specially designed polymer gel matrices swollen in organic solvents, NMR parameters that provide relevant structural information can be revealed and measured. These NMR parameters can help to solve challenging structural problems when traditional solution NMR experiments fail to provide a unique solution. The results of this research will benefit a variety of fields that employ precise structural data, and will be particularly useful in the analysis of complex natural products and in the biopharmaceutical sciences. The analysis of the experimental data will be aided with computer simulations. <br/>The work is interdisciplinary and will enable both graduate and undergraduate students to learn several different disciplines, such as synthetic polymer/materials chemistry, NMR spectroscopy and computational chemistry. The program is open to all students but members of underrepresented groups in the sciences will be particularly encouraged to participate. The NMR and the computational part of the project are suitable for students with disabilities. Due to the interdisciplinary character of this project including an international collaboration with a researcher in Spain, the participating students will learn to work comfortably in culturally and scientifically diverse environments. An important outcome of the project is the implementation of the residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) analysis in the analytical chemistry curricula. The introduction of an RDC module in analytical undergraduate or graduate laboratory courses is planned."
0.053698,"The project covers several topics. The first is the development of new methods for analysis of active scalar equations. These are nonlinear and nonlocal partial differential equations that, in particular, include classical two-dimensional Euler equation describing ideal fluid flow, and surface quasi-geostrophic equation arising in atmospheric science. Active scalars have been used to model a wide range of phenomena in nature, including formation of fronts in atmosphere, diffusion in porous medium and evolution of vortex sheets. Research will build on recent work of the principal investigator (PI) by finding more general maximum principles (bounds controlling solutions). A novel aspect of this research is that these bounds are nonlocal, which may be just the right fit for nonlocal equations like active scalars. New techniques are expected to provide progress on key questions in mathematical fluid mechanics involving structure of solutions to active scalar equations, their regularity and possible singularity formation. The second direction focuses on enhancement of diffusion by fluid flow. Numerous processes in nature and engineering, starting from nuclear burning in stars to combustion in engines to reactions in living organisms depend on this phenomenon. The goal is, building on the earlier research of the PI, to improve understanding of flows that are most efficient in speeding up diffusion and mixing. The problem is at the interface of partial differential equations, dynamical systems and Fourier analysis. The methods to be developed here will be relevant in a more general context. They apply in problems that involve convergence to equilibrium in systems that contain both dissipative and fast unitary parts of dynamics. The third direction, biomixing, is motivated by a problem of coral broadcast spawning that has been communicated to the PI by an oceanographer. It involves studying improvement of the efficiency of biological reactions by chemotaxis. A model is proposed that adds chemotaxis term to the previously studied models of the process. The effect chemotaxis has on fertilization rate is likely to be crucial for health of many biosystems. The goal of this direction of the project will be to better understand coral spawning process and quantify an important role chemotaxis plays in achieving the reproduction success.<br/><br/>The project focuses on several problems in fluid mechanics. In one direction, novel techniques are developed that will provide insight into behavior of solutions to equations modeling diverse phenomena from temperature evolution in the atmosphere to traffic flow dynamics. In other direction, the problem of mixing in fluid flow will be studied, and classes of flows that are most efficient mixers will be identified. The question of efficient mixing is of interest in many industries, including food processing and chemical engineering. Another direction of the project research improves reproduction models for a class of marine animals including corals. Coral atolls are important ecosystems that are under stress worldwide due to climate change and pollution. The models that will be developed in the project are important for better understanding of coral life cycle, and will be of interest in oceanography and ecology. The project has a significant and broad training component, and will involve a postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students working on problems related to the project research."
0.555,"This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) as well as additional support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) and the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Programs funds the acquisition of a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer by Wellesley College. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out modern research. This instrument is used in research on small organic molecules with potential anti-cancer and anti-tubercular properties, mutation of DNA oligonucleotides, and modified nanoparticles for imaging and medicinal usages.

0.13,"This award funds the research activities of Professors John Donoghue and Lorenzo Sorbo at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. <br/><br/>One of the most active areas in theoretical physics involves the connections between general relativity, which is our theory of the gravitational interactions, and the fields of particle physics and cosmology. The union of gravity and quantum mechanics has fundamental problems to be addressed, and the connection of fundamental physics to cosmology will allow crucial tests of our present ideas. Professors Donoghue and Sorbo will conduct a research program which addresses these new frontiers. Professor Donoghue will use the techniques of what is called ""effective field theory"" to study quantum-gravity effects that are reliably calculated at low energy. Professor Sorbo's primary research involves novel effects in the study of the universe, including possible new ways of testing proposed new theories. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe and its fundamental properties. Professors Donoghue and Sorbo will also involve graduate students and postdocs in their research, and thereby provide training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. They will provide outreach to high-school students and teachers, and develop a new book promoting the understanding of quantum field theory. <br/><br/>More technically, Professor Donoghue will use effective field theory to treat quantum problems in general relativity in the region where the effective field theory is valid. He will also conduct research at the frontiers of understanding in Soft Collinear Effective Theory, Asymptotic Safety, and nuclear binding. Professor Sorbo will explore various phenomenological aspects of primordial inflation, with a special emphasis on the possible explanations of the anomalies observed in the CMB spectra. He will also investigate the gravitational couplings of axion dark matter, the behavior of four-form fields coupled to moduli, and various aspects of massive gravity."
0.15,"It is well known that a significant number of catastrophic disasters involving airplanes, bridges, and damns, for example, were due to our inability to identify impending fatigue damage of certain critical components. Therefore, in order to improve the safety, reliability, cost, and performance of structures and components, it is necessary to develop techniques that are capable of characterizing and quantifying the amount of material damage induced by cyclic loading. To meet this need, a suite of new ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques have been proposed. These new techniques will have the unique capability of detecting localized fatigue damage in metallic materials with dramatically improved accuracy, resolution and selectivity over existing ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques. Such capabilities are critical in many engineering applications including aircraft, automotive vehicles, nuclear power plants and civil infrastructures. The nonlinear wave mixing technique developed in this project will add one more tool to our existing toolbox for safe and sustainable operation of aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering systems. <br/><br/>Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques have been used extensively during the last half century. The vast majority of these techniques utilize only the linear behavior of the ultrasound. These linear techniques are effective in detecting discontinuities in the materials such as cracks, voids, interfaces, inclusions, etc. However, for ductile materials such as metals, it is the accumulation of fatigue damage that leads to crack initiation and eventual failure of the component. Unfortunately, linear ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques are incapable of characterizing or quantifying such damage. To overcome this critical shortcoming of the existing technologies, new techniques based on nonlinear ultrasound will be developed in this project. Specifically, the project will develop the fundamental theories for the wave mixing phenomena in nonlinear elastic solids, and the measurement techniques for nondestructive evaluation of localized fatigue damage in metallic materials by utilizing the nonlinear wave mixing phenomena. The project consists of two tasks. Task 1 focuses on advancing our knowledge of wave mechanics by developing mathematical models and conducting numerical simulations of the mixing of various types of waves in nonlinear solids. Based on the knowledge gained from Task 1, Task 2 will develop novel nonlinear wave mixing techniques for nondestructive evaluation of localized fatigue damage in metallic materials and structural components."

0.05984,"To evaluate cortical bone porosity Nuclear Magnetic Resonance equipment can be used. The hydrogen atom attached to oxygen in the water molecules in biological tissue can be used to assess how far a water molecule moves in the bone due to random motion during a specific time of measurement. This information can be used to obtain a map of the pore sizes in the bone and thus is of practical use in medicine. Similar techniques have been successful in assessing the pore sizes of oil rich earth samples to assess oil content. The acquisition of the equipment requested in this proposal will allow Texas A&M International University, a minority serving institution (93% Hispanic students), to enhance the quality of student research/instruction. The proposed equipment will help faculty and students to: (1) study and understand the principle of magnetic angle spinning NMR and solid state NMR; (2) pursue and develop bone related research; and (3) learn solid state NMR technology and apply it to a variety of different applications. Research findings and results will be disseminated in journals and at professional conferences. Several graduate and more than 40 undergraduate students will be involved in NMR related workshops and projects each year. This equipment will also be of benefit for the studies of physics, chemistry, and bioengineering, as well as will be used in classes of more than 20 undergraduates each year for the training of critical thinking and research methodology. The addition of this spectrometer probe will make the science program at TAMIU more competitive, aid the recruitment of new faculty and students, and enable more primarily minority undergraduate and graduate students to conduct high quality research in science degree programs at TAMIU.<br/><br/>The PI's current low-field bench-top NMR system uses NMR CPMG spin-spin (T2) relaxation time signal due to water in mobile phase to characterize the cortical bone porosity and pore size distribution, and uses NMR free induction decay (FID) measurements to determine water components in bound and mobile phases. With this requested instrumentation the PI can conduct further research into the 1H environments of bone materials to identify the locations of bone minerals and bone architecture, including water. Specifically, the PI will characterize how water stabilizes the mineral structure and how it couples with mineral crystallites to the surrounding bone structure. We hypothesize that low-field NMR and high field with magnetic angle spinning (MAS) NMR will provide a more complete interpretation of water distribution in bone microstructure, and these data are important to assess bone quality and predict the mechanical behavior of bone. In addition, the high-field magnetic angle spinning (MAS) technique can be used to decouple and reduce the dipolar and susceptibility effect between the solid and the liquid-like phases. This research will provide a more complete picture of bone microstructure to be used as the basis for further bone related research, and material and edical applications. The requested instrumentation will provide other faculty with a necessary tool for use in pursuing aspects of their research that are presently not available on the TAMIU campus."
0.462787,"White dwarfs stars are the remnants of stars like the sun that form after their nuclear furnace has gone out. There are billions of them in our galaxy and most are not doing anything interesting besides cooling off. However, some of them orbit in close binary (double-star) systems in which the stars eventually spiral together causing massive explosions, others pulverize comets and asteroids left over from their planetary systems, and still others have ""starquakes"" that let us conduct seismology of their interiors. This project will study interesting examples of white dwarfs to learn about the supernova explosions that astronomers use to measure distances, the composition and configuration of exoplanetary systems, and the physics of material that is 10 million times denser than lead and cannot be produced or studied in any terrestrial laboratory. This program will also facilitate student training in instrument development and provide a new observational capability for the astronomical community. <br/><br/>The PI and his team of graduate students will carry out 3 separate investigations using white dwarfs as tools to study (1) whether hot DQ white dwarfs result from mergers of two sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, (2) whether metal-rich white dwarfs with circumstellar dust are accreting planetary material, and (3) the properties of ZZ Ceti stars. The common thread is observations to be obtained using the SOAR telescope with the Goodman Spectrograph, which was built by the PI. With partial support from this award, the PI will build a red-channel for the spectrograph, which is of great interest to the observational community and which will further enable the three key observational programs."
0.627,"In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrew Moran and his research group at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will study how large assemblies of molecules absorb light, and transfer the energy from one part of the assembly to another. They will focus specifically on the role of spatially correlated nuclear motion in light harvesting mechanisms. The study will obtain information about atomic and molecular motions on very short time scales using a femtosecond laser technique called two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy (2D-PES). In addition, Prof. Moran and his team will develop a new technique called intraband electronic coherence spectroscopy (IECS), which will provide more detailed information about the mechanisms controlling energy transfer processes. The systems to be studied include light harvesting phycobilisomes, which are protein structures in cyanobacteria, as well as artificial cyanine dye aggregates, whose readily controlled shapes make them excellent models for exploring structure-function relationships. <br/><br/>This research project will advance our fundamental understanding of photochemical processes, and also have implications for the biological sciences (e.g., photosynthesis) and sustainable energy technology. The research program will be fertile ground for undergraduate and graduate students. Many of the optical components used in the experiments are/will be built by graduate students. This hands-on experience represents a unique opportunity for chemists to obtain an interdisciplinary expertise in advanced methods of ultrafast science. Undergraduates will contribute by preparing the nanostructured aggregates that will be studied using 2D-PES and IECS. As part of the Project Seed Program, high school students will participate in the research program. For example, they will use computer simulations to design pigment complexes and simulate their absorption spectra. In addition, Prof. Moran and his team will conduct laboratory demonstrations for a Pre-College program administered by the School of Education at the University of North Carolina. The goal of the Pre-College program is to broaden the pool of students pursuing mathematics and science based majors and careers."
0.235303,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Advanced technical glasses are key in many areas of our lives, and although glass is rightly perceived as a robust material, it is nevertheless subject to corrosion due to interaction with water and the environment thereby limiting the functionality of this highly versatile material. A deeper understanding of glass corrosion is thus highly relevant to industry in the development of technical glasses, in enabling applications such as nuclear waste management, and in developing novel biomaterials. This project aims at understanding the fundamental science governing corrosion of multicomponent silicate glasses with mixed glass formers in aqueous solutions, achieved through an integrated combination of experimental studies and computer simulation approaches. Successful completion of this project is expected to lay the foundation of new fundamental knowledge for the understanding of composition-structure-property relationships in glass corrosion, with tangible implications on the glass and packaging industries. By training undergraduate and graduate students in glass science and engineering, the lacuna of talent in the pipeline for the US glass/materials science industry is being reduced. Students in this project are receiving part of their training at Corning, Incorporated, a company specializing in technical glass materials, or in a European research environment. The education activities build interest in students at the middle and high school level, in addition to the training of undergraduate and graduate science and engineering students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: While glass corrosion has been studied for a long time, it is riddled with complexity that makes a holistic understanding deceptively difficult. The current understanding in this field is based primarily on empirical data, and there is still no complete consensus on the basic mechanism of glass dissolution that applies to a wide composition space. Therefore, there is exigent need to develop solid fundamental understanding of the connection between chemical composition, atomic/molecular structure and chemical durability of glasses in order to address crucial and scientifically challenging problems. Accordingly, the project aims at combining the strengths of experimental studies and atomistic computer simulations to understand the connection between composition, molecular structure, and dissolution behavior of SiO2-rich multicomponent oxide glasses comprising multiple network forming oxides (B2O3, Al2O3, P2O5). The general focus on silicate systems helps to connect with real-world multicomponent glasses, and provides a suitable platform for (some) known structural trends to connect with durability properties. The project is expected to unearth the fundamental science governing the corrosion of glasses and deliver experimental data along with structural descriptors and energy functions that can be used to develop theoretical models predicting the chemical durability of glasses."
0.199961,"Intellectual merit: The project is creating, testing, and distributing new curricular materials to integrate the WorldWide Telescope (WWT) astronomy visualization environment into the hands-on laboratory programs in undergraduate general education astronomy courses. The new material is designed to address and alter student misconceptions regarding size, scale, and structure in the universe. The four lab-based activities, <br/><br/>i) Parallax Measurements and the Distances to Nearby Stars, <br/>ii) Spectroscopic Parallax and the Distance to Star Clusters, <br/>iii) Globular Clusters and the Size of the Milky Way Galaxy, and <br/>iv) The Hubble Law and Measures of Large-Scale Structure, <br/><br/>allow students to investigate the essential ways astronomers measure distance in our universe in an interactive 3-D visualization environment with real astronomical data. This multi-perspective visualization of inherently 3-D astronomical structures produces a much more intuitive view than can static 2-D diagrams in traditional curricular materials, and it has the potential to transform student understanding of size, scale, and structure in the universe. Students can compare their own conceptions of size, scale, and structure with evidence-based maps, and develop a more accurate mental model for their celestial surroundings. <br/>These new curricular materials are being tested through application in general education astronomy courses first at Bucknell University and subsequently at partner institutions. Gains in student understanding are being measured using research-validated concept inventories and other qualitative assessments. Once the curricular materials have been shown to be effective in reducing student misconceptions, they are to be widely available, along with associated documentation, to the Astronomy 101 teaching community. WWT is freely available and runs on virtually any PC, so instructors at a wide range of institutions can make use of the developed curricular materials. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The concepts of size, scale, and structure extend beyond topical boundaries in STEM disciplines. From the smallest scales of nuclear and atomic physics, to the hidden geometry of Earth's crustal plates and faults, to the gargantuan scale of our universe, students are challenged to visualize and comprehend unseen and inaccessible geometries. Though the curricular materials deal specifically with these issues in an astronomical context, they provide opportunities for students of all disciplines to visualize unseen entities and build a coherent understanding of an inaccessible structure based on scientific interpretation of observational data. Three dimensional visualization and spatial reasoning skills have been shown to be critical for success not only in STEM careers, but also in careers not directly involving science and technology. For undergraduate students not majoring in a STEM discipline, a general education astronomy class may provide their only college experience in 3-D spatial visualization. The curricular activities in this project provide those students with the opportunity to explore 3-D astronomical structures in an interactive and student-driven intuitive environment. Practice in manipulating 3-D objects substantially increases spatial reasoning skills and improves a student's ability to create accurate mental maps of complex 3-D objects. This project brings powerful spatial visualization software to the undergraduate general education classroom, and helps non-science students develop spatial reasoning skills while forming a more accurate map of their natural surroundings."
0.209557,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Chalcogenide glasses are an important class of materials that have found wide-ranging applications in the areas of photonics, telecommunication, optical memory storage, photovoltaics and environmental remote sensing. However, surprisingly, little is known regarding the flow response of the parent melts or liquids from which these glasses are derived, especially when these melts are subjected to large deformation rates during various industrial forming processes, including but not limited to molding, extrusion, embossing and fiber drawing. This project aims to investigate the mechanistic relationships between deformation rate and the flow behavior at the atomic scale in a variety of chalcogenide glasses and liquids for the first time, using a variety of cutting-edge characterization techniques. This fundamental understanding may enable the identification of chalcogenide glasses suitable for low-temperature polymer-forming processes, thereby permitting their widespread application in transformative technologies with strong societal impact. Scientifically, this work impacts materials science, physical chemistry and solid state physics. The interdisciplinary nature of this work transfers knowledge between fields and provides the students with unique opportunities for intellectual growth. The impact of this research in education and outreach is in three major areas: (1) participation by students, (2) active collaboration with industry, and (3) dissemination of knowledge, especially of glass science and technology, to the broader scientific community. The research activities provide the core of special topics courses that are offered to students in materials science, chemistry and other related fields; contribute to campus programs for women and minority students; and to recruiting promising students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The non-Newtonian flow response of a supercooled glass-forming liquid, when it is driven out of equilibrium via mechanical deformation, is intimately linked to its viability for various processing techniques and is of key significance in industry in controlling and optimizing the corresponding processing parameters. This GOALI project brings together investigators with complementary expertise and common interests from the University of California at Davis (Sen) and from Corning, Incorporated (Aitken) to address the connections between the atomistic and the macroscopic aspects of the non-Newtonian flow and related phenomena in chalcogenide glass-forming liquids in the systems Ge-As-Se and Ge-P-Se using a powerful combination of state-of-the-art rheometric measurements and structural and dynamical characterization with high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. Predictive atomistic models of structure-deformation-viscous flow relationships, built on the basis of the results obtained in this project, may ultimately enable the use of chalcogenide glasses in a wide range of low-temperature continuous forming processes, thereby making these materials viable for widespread applications in modern technologies ranging from photonics and telecommunication to remote sensing. The focus of this project, namely how and why, the dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of strain-induced rearrangements of the atomic structure control the shear thinning behavior and related phenomena in chalcogenide glass-forming liquids is in itself crosscutting materials research. The breadth, flexibility and interdisciplinary nature of this project prepares students with powerful experimental skills and research experience in both academic and industrial settings that may open up many opportunities for their future careers. This project also enriches the graduate education and training experience through numerous scientific dialogues and interactions between the collaborating scientists and participating students."

The hypothesized results of these reactions include transformations of these abundant feedstock chemicals into more useful substances that require significantly more energy-intensive strategies to prepare using current methods.

Reaction products are characterized by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and IR (infra-red) spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry and X-ray crystallography, the latter via collaboration with the University of Minnesota."
0.075,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The measurements that will be carried out within this project will lead to a better understanding of nucleon structure and a better understanding of the effects of bound quarks moving at relativistic velocities. In particular, the proposed measurements will be used to extract detailed radial charge distributions of the proton and neutron, and will lead to a better understanding of how to interpret data from electron scattering experiments on nuclei. This project will train and support both undergraduate and graduate students, most of whom are minority students. The program is highly interdisciplinary. It includes work with both hardware and software i.e., electronics, nuclear detector systems, optics, computer simulation, and data analysis. Students engaged in the program will work in a state-of-the-art facility and interact with scientists from other nationally recognized universities. These research activities will significantly impact the training of the students, preparing them for entering the STEM workforce of the 21st century.<br/><br/>This grant is to support research activities at North Carolina A&T State University on two programs. The first is the nucleon Form Factors (FF) program in Hall A at Jefferson Lab which is dedicated to the measurement of the neutron electromagnetic form factor ratio in double polarized, quasi-elastic scattering on 3He, and separately the neutron magnetic form factor in quasi-elastic scattering off the deuteron, both at high momentum transfer. The second is to measure the neutron Electric Form Factor at high momentum transfer from a deuterium target via recoil polarimetry in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. Elastic electromagnetic Form factors of the nucleon (proton or neutron) provide key information on the structure and the composition nature, of the nucleon, and the dynamics of quarks and gluons. For the FF program the group will build a photon detector array for the Gas Ring Imaging Cherenkov counter. For the experiment of Hall C, the group is building the polarimeter veto counters and the Delta-E detector arrays that identify the recoil proton from the neutron scattering events in the polarimeter analyzer."
0.17,"This project will investigate the mechanisms that allow organisms to survive after exposure to high temperatures. Using baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), experiments will focus on understanding how cells coordinate genome-wide changes in gene expression following heat stress. Because the heat stress response is evolutionarily conserved, research using yeast as the model is expected to provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms employed in more complex organisms. Additional broader impacts of this research include the training of two graduate students and summer research opportunities for three high school biology teachers from a school district with a large, underrepresented minority population. <br/><br/>The dynamic regulation of stress-responsive genes is critical for viability of all eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae, the gene-specific and evolutionarily conserved activator, Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1), plays a central role in stimulating both basal and induced transcription of HSP genes. These genes encode molecular chaperones that are critical for maintaining protein homeostasis and in combating proteotoxic stress. Whether Hsf1 is also responsible for the global down-regulation of non-HSP gene expression following exposure to thermal stress is unknown. Aim 1 employs chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to investigate genome-wide occupancy of Hsf1 under both non-stressful and stressful conditions, and determine the activator's role in directing the genome-wide occupancy of Mediator, a central coactivator and signal integrator of Pol II transcription. In addition, comparative dynamic transcriptome analysis will be used to measure global transcription rates and correlate these with genome-wide Hsf1, Mediator and Pol II occupancy. Aim 2 employs chromosome conformation capture techniques to characterize the in vivo conformation and nuclear organization of Hsf1-regulated genes under both non-inducing and heat shock-inducing conditions. A key goal is to solidify evidence that HSP genes loop, 'crumple' (accordion-style) and coalesce into transcriptionally active foci following exposure of cells to heat shock, and determine the kinetics with which they form and dissipate looped DNA structures. Additionally, through use of looping, crumpling and coalescence-deficient mutants, the biological significance of these phenomena will be explored. Results are expected to advance understanding of how gene regulatory changes enable cell survival following heat stress."

0.825,"Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This individual investigator project trains graduate and undergraduate students who conduct research on the structure of various quantum condensed phases with a focus on 3He superfluids at low temperatures. The central part of this proposal is to characterize certain types of quantum states which have topological significance and can be found at the surface of these superfluids. The impact of the research will be felt over a broad range of condensed matter physics, on field theories basic to the understanding of neutrinos, and may have relevance to the understanding of dark matter. New superfluid phases of helium have been predicted to exist within globally-anisotropic, highly-porous, silica aerogels. These materials will be grown with assistance from undergraduate students who characterize them using optical birefringence, and small angle Xray techniques. Additionally, our aerogels will be provided to a half-dozen laboratories around the world where there have been specific requests. High-resolution acoustics in resonant cavities will be used used to investigate surface quantum states in thin samples of superfluid 3He and a search for direct evidence of broken, time-reversal symmetry will be conducted. This fundamental broken symmetry is of importance to studies on various unconventional superconducting materials conducted in other laboratories.<br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This individual investigator project supports graduate and undergraduate education through their research in experimental physics. The project develops, creates, and characterizes new quantum states of matter which exhibit symmetry properties that have the potential for impact on our society, including high speed computation, transfer of mass in the form of frictionless superfluids, as well as applications of superconductivity. Highly porous, gel structures, so-called aerogels, will be grown and characterized in order to control the quantum states of helium superfluids imbibed within. These highly homogeneous samples will also be provided to a half dozen other laboratories that have requested them. The basic scientific research conducted in this project provides student training in high-resolution acoustics, nuclear magnetic resonance, and low temperature techniques and promotes awareness in both public and scientific communities to conserve helium as a valuable natural resource."
0.27,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports combined theoretical research, education, and outreach to pursue the consequences of spin-orbit coupling in various materials through a chiral Fermi liquid theory. The research part of the proposal will explore possibilities of new phases of electronic matter in two-dimensional electron systems with strong spin-orbit coupling, focusing on electron and hole gases in gallium-aluminum-arsenide heterostructures, surface states of oxides, states at oxide interfaces, and three-dimensional topological insulators.

Using the already existing framework of the advanced multi-faculty course at the UF Department of Physics, the PI will develop month-long courses of lectures on the topics relevant to this project for graduate students. Educational materials for these lectures will be available for a broader audience of graduate students and researchers via the UF Physics website. At the undergraduate level, the PI will involve participants of the existing REU program in some of the research projects related to this proposal. Finally, the PI will deliver popular lectures on advances in nanoscience to Florida STEM teachers. <br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research that crosscuts two very active research areas in materials research. The first one is the field of strongly correlated electron systems and quantum phase transitions in itinerant electron systems. The main goal of this field is to understand the mechanisms by which the electrons in a many-electron system choose to organize themselves into an ordered state, such as magnetism over a liquid-like state. The second one is the field of semiconductor spintronics and quantum computation with spin qubits. The main physical ingredient of this field is correlated dynamics of just a few or many electrons along with their spins. There are interesting ""overlap regions"" between these two areas, and the PI aims to investigate them. The results will help to improve our understanding of fundamental physics in both areas, and thus will be of interest to a broader community. The universal language of symmetry-based phenomenology employed by the theory of Fermi liquids should be equally familiar to large communities of researchers working in strongly correlated electron systems and in spintronics/quantum computation. Training of graduate students will prepare them not only to life in academia but would also give them useful problem-solving skills that can be used outside of academia. The PI's group has a strong record for placement of PhD students some of whom made successful academic careers and some chose equally successful careers in industry."
0.381838,"The research objective of this collaborative study is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of modeling and control of Friction Surfacing-based Additive Manufacturing by creating a functionally graded, multi-layered weld transition joint between chrome moly steel (T91) and austenitic stainless steel (AISI316). The research approach will be to apply various nickel based alloy layers by friction surfacing, creating a smooth and gradual transition in physical and metallurgical properties to improve their creep life. The experimental program involves stress rupture and creep-fatigue tests to assess the creep behavior of the transition joints. The research approach for in-situ finite element modeling involves development of fine-scale crystal plasticity and homogenized anisotropic continuum plasticity models, which will help in obtaining the optimized process parameters for the fabrication of components using Friction Surfacing-based Additive Manufacturing. <br/><br/>If successful, this research will aid the accelerated deployment of T91 and AISI316 weld transitional joints for structures in emerging initiatives including boiler, nuclear and clean energy concepts. Through the finite element model development, not only can T91/316 joints be made, but a basic modeling and manufacturing infrastructure will be developed that can be applied to any application where transitional joints are needed between hard-to-process materials and/or materials where fusion welding produces undesirable intermetallic formation. The successful completion of this research will enable higher-temperature power plants to generate power 1) at lower cost 2) with lower greenhouse gas emissions and 3) in larger quantities resulting in a better quality of life. The results will also help make it possible to manufacture better performing and optimized components in a host of other engineering industries. The educational objectives of the proposal will focus on training of post-doctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students. Advanced Surface Technology course will be developed which will expose the students to the state-of-the-art advances in manufacturing technologies."
0.458471,"In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Thomas Skinner of Wright State University and his graduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the development of new pulse sequences for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using optimal control methods. Prof. Skinner and his students will develop robust methods that will work in experiments where other methods fail. In addition, in this grant period, Prof. Skinner's group will begin to work on developing pulse sequences for use in X-band EPR spectroscopy. <br/><br/>NMR and EPR spectroscopy are workhorse techniques used by chemists, chemical engineers, materials scientists, medical researchers, and other scientists in many more fields where determine molecular structures is critical for advancing understanding. Typically radio-frequency pulses are used to interrogate the sample in these techniques. Prof. Skinner's group is investigating the creation of new kinds of robust pulse sequences that are less susceptible to the effects of distortion or magnetic field inhomogeneity. The results of this work will yield new tools that will increase the speed with which these experiments can be done, without introducing artifacts. The broad dissemination of this work is increased through the continued collaboration with an industry leader in NMR and EPR instrumentation, making the results of this research widely available to a large community of users. In addition, Prof. Skinner's students are trained in cutting edge methods in a scientific area that shows continued growth, guaranteeing that they will have valuable skills for the scientific/technical workforce."
0.077293,"This research project will dramatically improve computer algorithms used for the simulation of important problems in applied science, engineering, and bio-medicine, such as the modeling of blood flow in human veins, which provides critical data to evaluate surgical procedures and to design medical devices and implants. The area of fluid-structure interaction (i.e. coupling fluids with deforming solids), which this project addresses, is of current and growing interest due to its importance in many areas of engineering and applied science, including not only bio-medicine but also the modeling of flow-induced vibrations of structures (aircraft, undersea cables, wind turbines, buildings), wave energy devices, parachutes and airbags, acoustic lenses, thermal expansion in nuclear reactor cores, and shock-structure interactions (blast effects). Computing accurate solutions of fluid-structure interaction problems efficiently is very challenging due to their complex physical and geometrical properties, but also due to challenging mathematical issues. The new techniques developed by this project will address both these challenges.<br/><br/>A wide class of important fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems are difficult to simulate due to the so-called added mass instability. The focus of the research is on FSI problems coupling incompressible flow with elastic or rigid structures. Of particular interest are problems in which the mass of the fluid and that of the structure are similar, such as in applications of hemodynamics, where added-mass effects are strong. The overarching goal of this project is to develop stable and high-order accurate partitioned algorithms for FSI problems that overcome the numerical difficulties associated with complex fluid-solid couplings and strong added-mass effects. These algorithms will be based on newly devised Added-Mass Partitioned (AMP) schemes that represent a conceptual breakthrough in the field by providing a path forward to develop accurate schemes for fluid-structure interaction problems. An important property of AMP schemes is that they remain stable even for light solids when added-mass effects are significant. The new algorithms will be incorporated into a flexible computational framework that will allow efficient simulations for wide class of complex fluid-structure interaction problems."
0.33,"In this collaborative project co-funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM) and by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Programs of the NSF Chemistry Division, Roberto R. Gil of Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA) and Nicolay V. Tsarevsky of Southern Methodist University (Dallas, TX) will develop new Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) methodologies for the constitutional, configurational and conformational analysis of small molecules in anisotropic media. By absorbing small molecules into stretched or compressed specially designed polymer gel matrices swollen in organic solvents, NMR parameters that provide relevant structural information can be revealed and measured. These NMR parameters can help to solve challenging structural problems when traditional solution NMR experiments fail to provide a unique solution. The results of this research will benefit a variety of fields that employ precise structural data, and will be particularly useful in the analysis of complex natural products and in the biopharmaceutical sciences. The analysis of the experimental data will be aided with computer simulations. <br/>The work is interdisciplinary and will enable both graduate and undergraduate students to learn several different disciplines, such as synthetic polymer/materials chemistry, NMR spectroscopy and computational chemistry. The program is open to all students but members of underrepresented groups in the sciences will be particularly encouraged to participate. The NMR and the computational part of the project are suitable for students with disabilities. Due to the interdisciplinary character of this project including an international collaboration with a researcher in Spain, the participating students will learn to work comfortably in culturally and scientifically diverse environments. An important outcome of the project is the implementation of the residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) analysis in the analytical chemistry curricula. The introduction of an RDC module in analytical undergraduate or graduate laboratory courses is planned."
0.763962,"Resistance proteins (R-proteins) are key players in a plant's defensive repertoire against pathogenic microbes. R-proteins act as sentinels that recognize incursion by a pathogen and initiate responses to limit the extent of infection. Although we understand in some detail the nature of the initial recognition event, little is known about how R-proteins signal to the plant that defenses need to be deployed. This project follows the intriguing observation that at least some R-proteins, once activated by a pathogen, interact with other proteins to stimulate enhanced expression of genes required to mount an effective immune response. The research to be carried out seeks to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate these events. The results are likely to contribute new strategies for developing crop varieties that are resistant to economically significant plant diseases. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student. Undergraduate students from under-represented minorities and economically disadvantaged students from the Biology Undergraduate Scholars Program (BUSP) will be trained. The project will also teach and train a high school student from Young Scholar Program (YSP) at UC Davis. The project will organize a science field trip for 5th grade students from an Elementary School to UC Davis.<br/><br/><br/>In plants and animals, the Nucleotide-binding domain and Leucine-rich Repeat (NLR) class of intracellular immune receptors function in defense against pathogens. Despite extensive research, post-pathogen recognition events leading to NLR activation and induction of defense signaling remain elusive. The investigators recent results indicate that the plant NLR N associates with the SPL6 protein in the nucleus to activate successful immune response against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). SPL6 is also required for NLR RPS4-mediated defense against Pseudomonas syringae bacteria expressing AvrRps4 effector. Therefore, SPL6 appears to be a conserved nuclear component that acts as a bridge between an activated NLR and induction of defense genes. In this project, the investigators will use a combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical, genomics, proteomics, and cell biology based approaches to understand the subcellular dynamics of NLRs during immune signaling. Precise function of SPL6 during immune signaling will be determined by identification and characterization of direct target genes that are regulated by SPL6. Also SPL6 interacting proteins will be identified and characterized. Results from the project will advance the field of immunity by providing mechanistic insights into NLRs function especially with respect to their spatial distribution and dynamics during defense. Knowledge gained will improve our understanding of plant immunity, help harness it to aid in the development of pathogen resistant crops and promote food security."

0.182977,"Magnetohydrodynamics describes the behavior of an electrically conducting fluid flow in the presence of magnetic fields. Electrically conducting fluids arise in applications including astrophysics, geophysics, plasma confinement, controlled thermonuclear fusion, liquid-metal cooling of nuclear reactors, electromagnetic casting of metals, ion thrusters for low orbiting satellites, magnetohydrodynamic drive for ships and submarines, microfluidic devices, and molecular biology. The fluid motion of the Earth's core maintains the terrestrial magnetic field, the solar magnetic field generates sunspots and solar flares, and the galactic magnetic field influences the formation of stars from interstellar clouds. These applications require substantially better modeling and simulation capabilities than presently exist. Problems without a clear scale separation, such as turbulence, are still at the frontier of multiscale modeling and simulation. When the fluid is electrically conducting, the turbulent fluid motions are accompanied by magnetic fluctuations. For Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, numerical simulations play a greater role than they play for hydrodynamic turbulence, since laboratory experiments are practically impossible and astrophysical systems (solar-wind turbulence, the most important system of high-Reynolds-number MHD accessible to in situ measurements) are too complex to be comparable with theoretical results. This research project will develop improved computational methods for these important problems.<br/><br/>This research project studies mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient methods to analyze direct and inverse problems constrained by MHD models. This includes the numerical analysis of computational algorithms, implicit explicit time-stepping schemes using the Elsasser variables, post processing via time-filters, spatial linear and nonlinear filters, spectral filtering, development of spatial filters specific to MHD turbulence, optimal control, and parameter estimation. Another objective of this project is to investigate the mathematical properties of several models for the simulation of the large eddies in turbulent viscous, incompressible, electrically conducting flows and new numerical models that permit long-time simulations, by time-splitting. The project has a broad impact for training undergraduate and graduate students in analytical and numerical aspects of magnetohydrodynamics, turbulence, and inverse problems."
0.305,"With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Philip Grandinetti at Ohio State University to develop high-throughput methods for characterizing the atomic level structure of glasses using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Glasses have been used by mankind for millennia. The first historical record of man-made glasses appears as far back as 4500 years ago and the use of glass in windows began over 2000 years ago. Today the technological and economical impact of glassy materials is both immense and diverse. Despite its technological success, glass scientists and engineers still often resort to Edisonian approaches in attempts to understand the chemical compositions of glasses with desired properties. This is because the physical and chemical processes responsible for the properties of glasses and for glass transition are incompletely understood. Professor Grandinetti and his coworkers aim to achieve significantly higher throughput NMR measurements on such samples by optimally integrating two NMR sensitivity enhancement strategies, echo train acquisition and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. Such high throughput NMR measurements in silicate glasses would considerably expand the range of chemical compositions that could be studied and eliminate the burden and cost of preparing isotopically enriched samples. This would have benefits for scientists studying the physics, chemistry, and materials science properties of glasses. The project will also provides interdisciplinary training opportunities to undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students. The PI's ongoing partnership with scientists at the CEMHTI-CNRS lab in Orleans, France, will provide students the opportunity to collaborate across national boundaries. A partnership between Professor Grandinetti and Berea College will provide undergraduate students with summer research opportunities.<br/><br/>In this multi-tiered project, the Grandinetti group will bring natural abundance Si-29 and O-17 2D NMR measurements of oxide glasses into the realm of routine measurements. In an effort to lay the groundwork for this project, the group will develop a next generation dynamic-angle spinning (DAS) probe in partnership with Revolution NMR, LLC. The group will then employ the DAS probe in a suite of complementary 2D NMR measurements to explore a series of thirty binary glass compositions of fundamental interest. In these studies, the Grandinetti lab will quantify the distributions of Si-O distances, Si-O-Si angles, and network-forming anionic species distributions. They will also develop the chemical shift anisotropy of Si-29 and the quadrupolar coupling of O-17 into a qualitative and quantitative probe of network modifier cation clustering, and develop the Si-29 J coupling across a Si-O-Si linkage into a more reliable probe of Si-O-Si angles and network connectivities. Taken together, these studies aim to provide a new level of qualitative and quantitative detail about structural order and disorder in glass. The structural details of glass to be elucidated through these studies would also benefit scientists seeking to develop thermodynamic models of glasses and melts, and seeking to refine potentials used in molecular dynamics simulations of glasses. Details on modifier cation clustering behavior in glasses will be useful to scientists developing improved structural models of ionic transport, of the mixed alkali effect, and of the microscopic structure of chemically strengthened glass."

0.392342,"Gravity is the least understood fundamental force of nature: there is a 16 order of magnitude disparity between the energy scale of quantum gravity and that of the electromagnetic and nuclear forces. The mystery can be cast in another way: why is gravity so much weaker? As a number of recent theories have suggested, important clues related to this ""hierarchy problem"" can be obtained by measuring how gravity behaves at sub-millimeter distances. Such measurements could lead to exciting new discoveries of physics beyond our current knowledge. However, the gravitational force between massive objects becomes weak very rapidly as their size and separation distance changes, thus making ultra-sensitive measurements a necessity at sub-millimeter length scales. This group is developing an experiment based on new technology which could advance our understanding of gravity by several orders of magnitude at the micrometer length scale. In this approach, a test mass is suspended in a ""container"" made of light, leading to greatly reduced friction and enhanced sensitivity. This research program is at the forefront of current knowledge and will enhance the scientific competency of the state of Nevada, which is currently under-represented in terms of scientific endeavor. The collaboration with researchers at Stanford and the NSF-sponsored Stanford Nanofabrication facility will improve the research infrastructure for the state, opening new pathways for future collaborations involving nanotechnology. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be broadly trained in experimental physics and nanofabrication and will be well positioned for entry into the scientific workforce. The fundamental nature of this project appeals to our sense of wonder about the natural world. The nation will benefit from an improved understanding of high-energy physics related to gravitational physics at the micron-length scale, at a fraction of the cost of particle-collider experiments.<br/><br/>This award supports work on an experiment with the goal of using laser-cooled trapped microspheres to test for Yukawa-type deviations from Newtonian gravity at the micron length scale. By optically levitating the force sensor, an exquisite decoupling from the environment is possible, potentially yielding sub-attonewton force sensitivity. This new technique could ultimately advance our understanding of gravity at the micron length scale by a factor of 100,000 or more, probing deep into the parameter space for theoretically predicted deviations from Newtonian gravity. In addition to studies of short-range gravitational forces, the experimental technique we propose could also enable novel investigations of Casimir forces in unexplored regimes. The project is conceptually divided into three tasks: (1) calibration and optimization of the force sensitivity of the trapped cooled microspheres, (2) final assembly of the source mass and its driving mechanism, (3) investigation of systematic errors in preliminary gravity measurements. We will also investigate novel methods for cooling the levitated nanospheres, involving sympathetic cooling with cold atoms. A graduate physics course ""Hybrid Quantum Systems"" will be developed to complement and augment the proposed research, leading to new ideas and opportunities for advancing science, while developing students' breadth and expertise in STEM topics.

0.576,"This award provides base support for the particle astrophysics program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to participate in the Borexino solar neutrino experiment and the DarkSide project for the search of weakly interacting particle dark matter (WIMPs) in our galaxy. <br/><br/>Solar neutrinos have played a crucial role in the experimental confirmation that neutrinos have mass and oscillate. Since data acquisition started in 2007, Borexino has reached its design goal and measured the flux of mono-energetic 7-Beryllium solar neutrinos with enough precision to test the predictions of current solar models. After a scintillator purification campaign in 2011, Borexino is in a new phase of solar neutrino physics with the goal of measuring the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A precise knowledge of solar neutrinos will allow us to understand how the sun and other stars work, test the MSW-LMA neutrino oscillation paradigm and search for deviations from it. Borexino will possibly resolve an open question on the metallicity of the Sun's core, an important piece of information with which to study the evolution of larger stars in the universe. <br/><br/>DarkSide-50, a dual-phase time projection chamber scheduled to come online in late 2012, will prototype design solutions for background free multi-tonne detectors with liquid argon as active target for WIMPs. A null observation would exclude some of the current leading dark matter candidates. A positive detection would begin to give answers to one of the big scientific unknowns of our times. DarkSide-50 will run with 50 kg of argon depleted more than 100-fold in the radioactive 39-Argon isotope. The DarkSide-50 Argon cryostat is surrounded by a compact, liquid scintillator neutron detector and immersed in the Borexino Counting Test Facility (CTF) water tank instrumented and operated as a Cherenkov muon veto. The Borexino and DarkSide collaborations have a significant overlap in personnel and technical and operational resources. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Borexino and DarkSide projects provide excellent opportunities for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in applications of software and hardware development, and fundamental physics.

0.216391,"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor George Makhatadze of Rensselaer Polytechnic Instiute to investigate the role of various physical-chemical interactions in determining the pressure dependence of protein stability. Pressure is an important environmental variable that plays an essential role in biological adaptation for many extremophilic organisms, called barophiles. This research project will rely upon the synergy between computer simulations and experiments. Computer simulations will provide solid theoretical framework for the analysis of the volume changes upon protein unfolding. Experiments will be performed to validate the computer simulations. In particular, these workers will be testing a hypothesis that proteins from barophilic organisms have volumetric properties that allow them to remain folded, even at elevated hydrostatic pressure. This project engages high school, undergraduate and graduate students in both computational and experimental aspects of the research in the laboratory. In recruiting trainees, there will be a particular effort to engage women and/or members of underrepresented minorities. The PI is also actively involved in curriculum development and serves as an undergraduate curriculum adviser for Biochemistry and Biophysics majors at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. <br/><br/>The proposed work will provide a significant refinement of a protein stability model to incorporate temperature dependencies of volume changes by combining concepts of evolutionary biology with biochemical and biophysical tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry as well as computational tools. It is expected that the knowledge accumulated as a result of these experiments will lay the foundation to understand the factors that affect protein folding and stability under extreme conditions. In the longer term, it is hoped that the lessons learned here will provide biophysical chemists with new insights as they seek to design enzymes with that are both active and robust. Broader scientific impacts in industrial biotechnology and in process chemsitry are anticipated, particularly as these scientists seek to develop robust biomaterials and replace current processes with next generation, environmentally friendly catalytic processes."
0.16,"This award funds the research of Professor Paolo Gondolo at the University of Utah. The central question addressed in the research is the nature of dark matter, a mysterious substance introduced to explain the measured motion of gas and stars in galaxies, the gravitational force in galaxy clusters, and the formation of galaxies out of the tiny lumps observed in the early universe. It has by now been established that dark matter cannot be made of any known particles. Many theoretical ideas exist for dark matter as a new elementary particle, and many experiments are being performed to test these theories. Professor Gondolo's group studies some of these theories, with the aim of understanding their validity and the ways to test them, and at the same time providing the science community with publicly-accessible assessment tools of theories and experiments. The discovery of dark matter particles, and therefore the direct confirmation of the existence of dark matter, would be a completion of the Copernican revolution, and would be the empirical foundation that the material substance humans are made of is only a minority component of the universe.<br/><br/>Technically, the research funded by this award addresses the question of the nature of dark matter by (1) providing state-of-the-art and user-friendly software tools to the particle dark matter community for the computation of cosmic densities and direct and indirect signals from generic models of weakly-interacting massive particles, (2) assess the nuclear physics uncertainties in the predictions of galactic cosmic ray fluxes as backgrounds to the indirect detection of dark matter particles, (3) supply proper statistical meaning to astrophysics-independent analyses of direct dark matter detection data, and (4) unify and complete the theory of generic dark matter scattering off atomic nuclei. The educational component of this award continues a very successful physics outreach program at the local museum and in local schools, seeking to attract young students to science in a fun, energetic, and engaging way so as to ultimately increase the number of responsible citizens and leaders who can address the major issues of our time with basic knowledge of science."
0.315973,"The RECONS (REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars) project is making a reconnaissance of the nearest stars to the Sun, focusing on our neighbors out to a horizon of about 80 light years. In the current effort, the team is focusing on the smallest stars, known as red dwarfs, and their slightly less massive cousins, the brown dwarfs. The main difference between the two types of objects is whether or not they can shine via nuclear reactions. Red dwarfs are true stars that fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores, like our Sun, and shine for many billions of years. Although they are the smallest true stars in the Universe, the red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star, accounting for at least three-quarters of all stars, but we're not quite sure how many there are. On the other hand, brown dwarfs are cooling bodies like Jupiter that do not fuse hydrogen, and behave more like superplanets. The RECONS team is taking a census of red and brown dwarfs and revealing how often they are orbited by stellar, brown dwarf, or planetary companions. We will then ultimately know just what fraction of the Sun's neighbors are stars and where some of the nearest planets are found. Through this program, specialized training in astrometry - the precise measurement of positions and motions on the sky - will be provided to Georgia State University students. As a large minority-serving institution, Georgia State well placed to provide research opportunities to students from underrepresented groups.

The RECONS catalog, publicly-available at their website, also provides the best estimate available for the relative populations of late-type stars and brown dwarfs.

0.291607,"Chang-Guo Zhan of the University of Kentucky is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program, co-funded by the EPSCoR office of NSF, to develop a first-principles electronic structure method accounting for solvent effects. This is very commonly modeled as a dielectric continuum reaction field while the solute is treated quantum mechanically. Many practical reaction field implementations represent the solvent polarization through an apparent surface charge distribution on the boundary of the solute cavity. However, quantum mechanical calculations usually lead to a tail of the wave function penetrating outside the cavity, which produces an additional volume polarization to the reaction field. The PI and his research group are developing a generalized implementation of a unique reaction field method, known as the fully polarizable continuum model (FPCM), capable of accurately determining volume polarization, in addition to the commonly treated surface polarization, for a general, irregularly-shaped solute cavity. In particular, they are developing the analytic energy derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates of the solute for the FPCM method so that the FPCM implementation can be used for geometry optimization and vibrational frequency calculations of molecules in solution. In addition, they make use of the generalized implementation together with other available computational methods to study some representative chemical problems involving molecular structures, properties, and reaction mechanisms. Students will be involved in the project and trained in these computational methods.<br/><br/>This generalization of the FPCM method is of interest in a wide range of disciplines such as inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, environmental chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutical sciences.

0.299932,"ABSTRACT<br/><br/> ""This award is co-funded by NSF?s International Science and Engineering Section, Office of International and Integrative Activities."" <br/><br/><br/>This project is to test and validate an optical technology, partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (PWS), as a first-tier screening tool for pancreatic cancer in a relatively large cohort. PWS allows for the measurement of statistical properties of the spatial arrangement of intracellular macromolecular density at the sub-diffractional length scales, i.e. nanoscale. Thus, PWS probes cellular nanoarchitecture, the fundamental level of intracellular organization at the level from macromolecular structures to small organelles. Using PWS, they demonstrated an increase in the disorder of nuclear nanoarchitecture in the earliest stages of carcinogenesis manifested as an alteration of the higher-order chromatin structure. This phenomenon was observed in multiple cancer types (lung, colon, pancreatic, esophageal, ovarian and thyroid cancers). In this project, taking advantage of an existing established US-China collaborative team via a National Cancer Institute funded gastric cancer project, and large patients? pool in Shanghai, China, this project will study PWS as a potential early detection marker for pancreatic cancer in Chinese patients. It will also study epigenetic mechanisms of how changes in higher order chromatin structure modulate gene transcription. From the educational perspective, the project will provide opportunities in truly interdisciplinary research at the interface of biophotonics, molecular biophysics, cancer epidemiology, cancer biology, and medicine for postdoctoral fellows, and graduate, undergraduate and high school students with a particular focus on recruitment of women and minorities in science. The findings will be incorporated into four graduate classes directed by the PIs. The findings and data generated during the course of the project will be disseminated to the scientific community.

0.639635,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Hydrogen is an attractive fuel for energy production because it has a high energy density and its combustion generates only water vapor, leaving no carbon bearing or radioactive by-products. However, unlike fossil or nuclear fuels, it cannot be mined from the earth; hydrogen must be synthesized. Photolysis, or light-driven water-splitting, is a promising renewable method to synthesize hydrogen. However, the best currently available processes are inefficient and, because of this, they are not competitive with conventional fuel sources. One of the fundamental problems is that no single material possesses the combination of properties needed to efficiently split water. This project is based on the idea that a composite, that combines materials with synergistic properties, will be able to catalyze water photolysis more efficiently and currently available materials.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project aims to test the hypothesis that by controlling charges at interfaces in oxide heterostructures, it is possible to build in mechanisms to separate photogenerated electron-hole pairs and thereby increase the efficiency of photolysis (water-splitting). The project builds upon recent discoveries of the composite catalyst effect for enhanced photochemical reactivity and has the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable fuel source. The hypothesis is being tested by studying a combination of planar oxide heterostructures, ideal for controlled measurements, and heterostructured oxide powders that would be required for any practical implementation. Fe2O3 and TiO2 films will be supported on a variety of ABO3-type substrates (for example, LaAlO3, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3, and FeTiO3); by choosing the appropriate phase and orientation, it is possible to control the spectral range of absorption, the carrier type, and whether or not there is a potential difference at the interface deriving from ferroelectricity, polar terminations. The effects of band offsets will also be explored in compounds in the pseudo-binary Cu2O-Fe2O3 system. Cross sectional scanning potential (Kelvin probe) microscopy is being used to map potential differences at the buried interfaces and these measurements are being compared to photoelectrochemical measures of reactivity and efficiency. Experiments are also being conducted to examine the effects of length scale on the properties of the heterostructures. The research will be an integral part of the education of graduate and undergraduate Materials Science and Engineering students."
0.329327,"This award will support a two-pronged attack on the problems of understanding supernova progenitors and of the physics of supernovae up to and immediately after the explosion. The first project, to be led by Dr. Arnett of the University of Arizona, will model the late evolutionary phase preceding iron core collapse (Type II supernovae) in massive stars. This will be the first time that such calculations have been done in three spatial dimensions, and will cover evolution to the onset of core collapse including an evaluation of the role played by rotation and other mechanisms of symmetry breaking. This epoch is characterized by a complex interplay between turbulence and nuclear burning that determines the entropy and density structure of the pre-collapse core, which along with rotation are important characteristics in determining the outcome of the core-collapse event. The second effort, led by Dr. Starrfield of Arizona State University, will explore accretion onto white dwarfs using compositions ranging from pure helium to a mixture with varying abundances of heavy elements. The goal of this work is to determine the initial conditions that lead either to a Supernova Type Ia explosion, an energetic helium flash, or helium novae. This work is motivated by the inconvenient situation that the kind of star producing Type Ia supernovae is still unknown, and both theoretical and observational arguments for and against various scenarios have only grown more complicated in recent years. Common to both projects is a numerical code that includes a new theory of turbulent convection in three-dimensions that includes good resolution in both spatial dimensions and in time. <br/><br/>The project is expected to impact the wider astrophysical community through the release of stellar evolution and convection codes. The project will also support the training of students and a postdoctoral fellow, and the results of this work will be incorporated into the curricula at both institutions."

The goal of this research is to synthesize and study high-spin nitrogen-centered radicals (aminyls) and chiral helical radical cations. The aminyls with strong through-bond ferromagnetic coupling and with persistence at room temperature are important to the development of lightweight, soft organic magnets. In addition, such organic radicals could benefit the development of metal-free paramagnetic contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), agents for paramagnetic relaxation enhancement nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as well as materials for spintronics. The helical radical cations, which possess an unpaired electron confined to a helix, could facilitate the discovery of new organic magneto-optic materials and devices. This interdisciplinary research project involves multi-step organic synthesis, diverse physical characterization of organic molecules, and computations, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels, with exceptional opportunities to gain a broad education as well as to develop a wide range of skills. This group is also well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>The proposed aminyls are high-spin radicals based upon annelated pi-systems of nitrogen-centered radicals that are made persistent by steric shielding of radical centers and isotopic substitution to prevent decay of radicals. The proposed radicals will be prepared by modern organic synthetic methodologies and characterized by electron spin resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, as well as computations. Aminyl diradicals with very strong pairwise ferromagnetic coupling between electron spins and persistence at room temperature, with half-life that would permit isolation of the radicals, will be investigated and compared to analogous nitroxide diradicals, to provide an insight into the degree of spin delocalization in the pi-system. Aminyl triradical will be prepared and extended to the synthesis of aminyl polyradical polymers with very large magnetic moment. The proposed chiral helical radical cations are based on nitrogen-centered radical cations of helical pi-systems, which would be configurationally persistent at room temperature. Helical radical cations are intriguing molecules with a combination of chiral pi-systems and paramagnetism. Helical, ladder-type pi-systems of n ortho-annelated aromatic rings, such as [n]helicenes, are among molecules with the strongest chiral properties. Paramagnetism of radical cations within the three-dimensional helical pi-system would render unique properties, a combination of helicene chirality and delocalized electronic spin, for development of novel paramagnetic materials with inherently strong chiral properties. Radical cations of aza-thio-[7]helicene and conjoined [5]helicene will be prepared and studied by electrochemistry, UV-vis-NIR, circular dichroism (CD), EPR spectroscopies, as well as computations."

The atomic structures of these materials are typically characterized by a network of covalently bonded atoms and structure-property relationships in these network chalcogenide glasses have been studied in detail. The physical and chemical characteristics of these networks can be substantially modified upon incorporation of elements such as Ba and Ga. Little, if any, is known about the unique properties of these new materials - they could result in transformative and wide-ranging technological applications. This research project brings together investigators with complementary expertise and common interests from UC Davis and Corning Incorporated (the world's foremost innovator and commercial developer of cutting-edge glass technology) to investigate the fundamental structure-property relationships in these novel chalcogenide materials. This project will finally enable the formulation of predictive models necessary for the optimization of these materials towards improved functionalities for potential commercialization. Students in this research project are learning to investigate problems in the realm of ""basic science"" that underlies industrial applications. The project is preparing students with powerful experimental skills and research experience in both academic and industrial settings that will open many opportunities for their careers. This project coordinates with the underrepresented minority-serving and other outreach programs at UC Davis to attract and recruit underrepresented graduate students and to increase the awareness of students in the science and technology of glassy materials. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project entails studying the structure-property relationships and developing an atomic scale understanding of the structural mechanisms of transport and relaxation near the glass transition in novel modified and compensated network ternary and quaternary chalcogenide bulk glasses, fibers and supercooled liquids in the Ba-Ga-Ge-Se system. Accomplishing this goal involves application of a powerful combination of state-of-the-art techniques of physical property measurement and structural and dynamical characterization including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman, optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, high-energy X-ray diffraction and reverse Monte Carlo simulation. The results are being combined to develop predictive models, linking the atomic structure and dynamics with macroscopic physical properties that are crucial for compositional optimization of these materials for a wide range of technological applications.

0.2375,"DNA Transport Through Carbon Nanotubes<br/>Non-technical Summary<br/>This CAREER Award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is to study the passage of molecules through small pores. The passage of molecules through small pores or structures plays a key role in many biological processes. Biological molecules regularly cross through pores in nuclear and cellular membranes to effect cell activity. This translocation process plays an essential role in many areas of biotechnology, like drug delivery and assembling recombinant DNA. This process can be studied experimentally by observing the rate that DNA molecules travel through well-defined nano-structures under the application of an electric field. There is still considerable debate concerning the fundamental physical processes that govern this process. It is envisioned that the results obtained from these experiments will inform the fabrication of future devices for the separation, manipulation, and potential sequencing of nucleic acids. The PI will measure the rate at which single stranded DNA molecules are transported through individual carbon nanotubes, both optically and electrically. In parallel to the research portion of this project the PI will use the concepts of polymer physics and nanofabrication as models in outreach efforts aimed toward increasing participation in physics by different groups of elementary, college, and graduate students. The proposed activities would significantly improve the physics education in local elementary schools in high-need rural areas of upstate New York. The method for integrating the educational plan into the research program relies on the active participation of undergraduate and graduate students in the PI's laboratory. Much of the science content will be taught using DNA as an example of a model polymer, which is a rich pedagogical tool combining aspects of biology, physics, and material science. The elementary school education will have a focus on microfabrication and biotechnology and their impacts on everyday life.<br/>Technical Summary<br/>In this project the PI will optically and electrically measure the rate at which single stranded DNA molecules are transported through individual carbon nanotubes, thus aiding in the understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern biomolecule transport through nanopores. The combination of optical detection with electrical detection is required to address fundamental questions about the transport process. Fluorescent DNA molecules will be tracked as they translocate a nanotube while the ionic current through the nanotube is simultaneously measured. The PI will measure capture rates and transit times using semiconducting and metallic carbon nanotubes as a function of applied voltage, DNA concentration, DNA length, and salt concentration. Modulating the charge on the carbon nanotubes will enable the PI to determine the critical role of electroosmosis in the transport process. This approach will also elucidate the dependence of the nanotube chirality and the nanotube surface charge on the DNA transport process. This experimental program will provide a quantitative understanding of biomolecular transport that ties together soft condensed matter physics, chemistry, and biology. In addition to the research portion of this project the PI will implement an integrated education plan that addresses current needs in Binghamton University's undergraduate and graduate curriculum. The components of the educational plan include: (1) a microfabrication module for undergraduate biologists aimed at increasing participation of underrepresented groups in physics; (2) entrepreneurship training for graduate students in the physical sciences; and (3) an outreach program that provides physics demonstrations to local elementary school children."

Additionally, the proposed training programs for researchers involved in materials development will accelerate the implementation of the new methodology in industry, resulting in very much increased effectiveness of our materials technologists. Regarding educational outreach, the present DMREF program encourages high school students with diverse ethnic backgrounds to enter science and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>This research program involves the integration of sophisticated computational models, at multiple scales, highly advanced materials characterization techniques, and combinatorial and accelerated methods for materials processing and property evaluation. Such a unique coupling will undoubtedly raise significantly the state-of-the-art in the discovery and development of new structural materials. Regarding the targeted material system involved in the proposed program, i.e. titanium alloys, the focus is on the exploitation of recently discovered non-conventional transformation pathways. Thus, recent theoretical and experimental investigations suggest possibilities of achieving extremely fine and uniform alpha+beta microstructures exhibiting substantially improved properties through these non-conventional transformation pathways including pseudo-spinodal decomposition and precursory phase separation. Using an integrated computational materials science and engineering (ICMSE) approach, the development of next generation of Ti alloys based on these new and promising transformation mechanisms will be accelerated. For the first time, alloy development will be led by computational modeling, mechanistically informed and validated by critical experiments involving novel combinatorial methods for materials processing and state-of-the-art characterization techniques. The focus is on Ti alloys for structural applications in a broad range of advanced technological areas including aerospace, transportation and energy (petrochemical and nuclear).

0.4,"Xu<br/>1150617 <br/><br/>Intellectual Merits<br/>Solar energy conversion and utilization can be implemented through photoelecrochemical (PEC) schemes that convert light energy to electricity, such as PEC-based photovoltaics (PV), or chemical energy such as solar fuels and solar environmental purification using photocatalysts. Therefore, understanding the basic science that defines and regulates the elementary light harvesting and charge transport processes in PEC systems is crucial for the advancement of PEC solar cells and photocatalysis. The overall goal of this proposal is to fundamentally transform and enhance the elementary light harvesting and charge transport efficiencies in current state-of-the-art PEC-based photovoltaic and photocatalytic systems. Specifically, the proposed research plan will aim to the following subtasks.<br/><br/>1. Converting the photoanodes of conventional PEC solar cells, typically in the format of a thick PV layer on a planar transparent conducting oxide (TCO), to a set of 3-D nanoarchitectured conformal TCO/PV photoanodes. This innovation will drastically shorten the transport length in the PV layer, leaving the majority of the transport in the nearly metallic TCO layer for enhanced photocurrent collection, while still providing sufficient PV material to accommodate the solar photon flux. The PI will study the fundamental transport mechanisms resulting from these transformative structures. In particular, reducing the thickness of the PV layer to approximately the width of the space charge layer (typically 30 nm) at the interface of TCO/PV layer can subject the overall light-induced charge separation and transport processes to the strong influence of the built-in potential at this interface. As a result, the slow diffusive transport mechanism can be replaced by the more efficient field-driven drift transport mechanism to suppress charge recombination in the PV layer. In turn, alternative faster redox mediators with less overpotential can be applied for enhanced photovoltaic performance. <br/><br/>2. Synergistically, the transformation from 2-D to 3-D TCO enables the incorporation of a variety of 3-D photonic crystal (PC) configurations into the 3-D conformal TCO/PV architectures, which can trap light through multiple scattering of photons, resulting in synergy rather than conflict between the light harvest and charge transport processes. As such, PEC solar cells can be more affordable since less PV materials are needed for accommodating the solar flux. <br/><br/>3. Ti3+ and/or oxygen vacancy self-doped TiO2-x can be an effective visible-light active photocatalyst that using no additional dopants, thus to minimize the environmental concerns. In order to achieve efficient visible-light activity, the concentration of Ti3+ must be high enough to induce a continuous vacancy band of electronic states just below the conduction band edge of TiO2. Distinguished from the conventional reduction of TiO2 (Ti4+-Ti3+) under harsh conditions, we propose an oxidative conversion (Ti2+-Ti3+) scheme that uses TiH2 and H2O2 as precursors for Ti3+ self-doped TiO2-x photocatalysts. This process will provide a facile, low-cost and high-concentration doping of Ti3+ throughout bulk of the TiO2-x matrix. The reaction of TiH2 and H2O2 produces a hydrolyzed sol-gel-like precursory TiO2-x, allowing convenient incorporation of plasmonic nanoparticles and formation of versatile nanoarchitectured TiO2-x for enhanced solar photocatalytic activity. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>As nanoscience provides more opportunities for more efficient PEC processes, the primary educational goal is to integrate introductory nanoscience experiments relevant to both this project and undergraduate chemistry into our existing curriculum with laboratory assignments, so as to provide students hands-on understanding in course work and basic nanoscience knowledge. Secondly, as an effective way to train the next generation scientists, the PI plans to broaden the research collaboration with Argonne scientists by developing a multifunctional program: Northern Student Scientists at Argonne. This program will incorporate PI's research collaborations with Argonne into student recruitment, education and training, research, employment and community outreach. The students will be exposed to world-class research environment, involved in frontline research projects at their young age, and trained with cutting-edge research facilities, cross-disciplinary knowledge, critical thinking and problem-solving methodologies, and team-work skills. Due to the growing concerns on environmental disasters related to petroleum and nuclear energy, PEC energy conversion becomes a highly attractive aspect of energy science. As energy science is Argonne's core research area, the PI will leverage Argonne'fs research and NIU's network to establish an outreach program Energy and Environment Workshop for students and teachers in local high schools via interactive presentations given by scientists at Argonne and Northern Illinois University."
0.182049,"CBET 1404591/1404655<br/>Li/Qian<br/><br/><br/>Solar energy supply is renewable, abundant, and environmentally benign. It is relatively free of problems associated with fossil fuels or nuclear energy, such as increasing fuel costs, waste disposal, heat dissipation, safety concerns, and the release of greenhouse gases. The solar cell is the key component of photovoltaic systems, which can directly convert the solar energy into electricity. While solar electricity generation technologies of today are dominated by silicon based materials, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost in fabrication, and their potential to be deployed in flexible structures. However, the energy efficiency of OSCs has thus far been impeded due to limited understanding of charge transport behaviors across length scales of OSCs; yet, such transport is crucial for device efficiency. The current try-and-error approach for optimization of OSC often fails due to nearly-infinite number of material combinations and processing conditions. The objective of this collaborative research is thus to develop a multiscale simulation and optimization methodology for OSCs that directly links the basic materials properties(electronic and optical), nanoscale morphology and their dependency on processing conditions (e.g. temperature and time), bulk material properties (e.g. bulk mobility), and device designs, to device efficiency. Successful completion of this research will pave a viable pathway for commercializing organic electronics in energy conversion, which can generate both green electricity and jobs throughout the United States. <br/><br/>The proposed research aims to merge simulation tools across multiple time and length scales using successive integration steps. The resulting tools would enable a holistic design approach where the design space will be systematically explored to dramatically improve the performance of OSC devices. Such a holistic approach integrates experimental validations to refine the simulations at each scale (micro, meso, and macro) and ultimately to verify the optimization results. More specifically, the research will verify the multiscale simulation by characterizing nanoscale morphology, measuring bulk mobility, and testing the devices. The PIs will then optimize the designs and fabrication processes of OSCs for high efficiency through surrogate modeling and sensitivity analysis of the multiscale models. Successful completion of this research will fill a critical knowledge gap in organic electronics research and will form a new simulation paradigm for organic electronics by accounting for multiscale coupling in charge transport and material properties and by experimental validation at each scale. The scheme to bridge the micro and macro scales in this project will set an example for multiscale simulation and optimization of other type of solar cells and energy devices such as super-capacitors and batteries. The results of these models and simulations will lead to more rational designs and greater potential for significant technological advances in OSCs."
0.163,"In many physical problems, the dissipation is very small and conservative models can be used for their study. These include the fluid motions in atmosphere and ocean, the Bose-Einstein condensate in quantum mechanics, the plasmas in controlled fusion devices, etc. The dynamical behavior of these models is very complex due to the lack of strong dissipation. One important topic is to understand the formation and persistence of coherent structures observed in experiments and in nature. Some examples include the large vortex structures in the atmosphere and ocean, the traveling wave patterns in ocean waves, and the observed galaxy structures. Another topic is to understand and control the instability in many applications. One such example is to control the instability of plasmas in fusion devices to achieve the goal of controlled nuclear fusion for energy production. Methods of mathematical analysis are the primary tools employed in the proposed investigations. The rigorous mathematics makes it feasible to do stable numerical computations and to better understand the phenomena found in numerical and experimental studies. <br/><br/> One focus of the project is to understand invariant structures including quasi-periodic solutions and invariant manifolds, near physically interesting equilibria of several PDE models, including Vlasov equations, incompressible Euler and Naiver-Stokes equations, and Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These invariant structures form a skeleton in the physical phase space and provide important clues to study long time dynamical behaviors. Topics to be studied include: the regularity threshold for nonlinear damping and the existence of nontrivial invariant structures near simpler equilibria of non-dissipative models including Vlasov models and 2D Euler equations, the construction of invariant manifolds in many conservative continuum models and Hamiltonian PDEs, and the persistence of invariant structures for large time scale under small dissipation. Also, new approaches will be developed to find stable BGK waves and electrostatic solitary waves of Vlasov-Poisson systems."
0.272112,"The PIs develop and test the theory and algorithms for a new sampling and reconstruction framework that combines spatial samples of an initial state together with the early time samples of an evolving state to reconstruct the initial distribution and the possibly unknown evolution operator. Using the evolutionary nature of a signal, the PIs aim to recover an initial distribution at a fine resolution from multiple coarse snapshots obtained at appropriate time intervals.<br/><br/><br/>One of the most important aspects of the proposed research is to provide the means to detect potential threats to society (such as chemical, nuclear or biological hazards) using a network of distributed sensors such as the smartphones people carry, rapidly gather and process the information about the threats source location and its distribution and evolution in time, and generate alerts so that appropriate measures are taken to safeguard life and infrastructure. The same ideas can be used in other industrial or biomedical applications in which the time-dependency between samples permits reduction in the number of expensive instruments via the increase of their usage frequency."
0.464341,"With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Gregory Tochtrop from Case Western Reserve and colleague Blanton Tolbert will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen cooled broadband X-detect probe and an automated sampling system. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of the catabolic fate of lipid peroxidation products; (b) NMR detection of RNA structures and protein-RNA contacts involved in viral replication; (c) studies of mechanically enhanced polymers; (d) advanced functional materials based upon organic conjugated polymers and molecules; (d) protein stability, structure, and dynamics; (e) interlocked polymeric architectures; (f) mechanisms by which enzymes are activated during signal transduction pathways; (g) characterization of conjugated molecules and polymers; and (h) design and characterization of fluoro-aromatic analogues of human insulin.<br/><br/>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research of students in the departments of Chemistry, Biology, Polymer Science & Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. The instrument will enhance the research and teaching capabilities of the greater Cleveland scientific community with web-based scheduling and cyber-enabled data delivery/processing for off-site users."
0.201,"This project will extract the lowest lying flavor singlet 0++ states in a model that could serve as an example of how electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically (technicolor). This will be the first analysis of flavor singlet 0++ states built from fermions in the lattice technicolor field of study. These are important objects, since they can be identified with the effective Higgs particle (sigma) or perhaps the dilaton of the theory. Obviously, understanding the mass of this state relative to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking, given by the technipion decay constant f(pi) of the theory, is of phenomenological relevance. We will also obtain an estimate of the width of this particle, which determines whether or not it is experimentally detectable. Based on studies of Minimal Walking Technicolor, the 0++ glueball may be anomalously light in the theory we propose to study; we will be able to extract its mass. It might even be able to be identified as the dilaton of the theory, depending on how small its mass is compared to f(pi). <br/><br/>The method used will be lattice gauge theory. To perform this task, we will extend the QUDA library (NVIDIA-based multi-GPU code developed for quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the nuclear strong interaction) to address SU(2) gauge theory with fermions in the adjoint (triplet) representation. On top of QUDA we will write software layers for simulation and for analysis. In the analysis stage we will estimate disconnected diagrams by exploiting dilution. We will also extract the glueball state by utilizing smearing, blocking and variational techniques. Our experience and software layers will enable us to rapidly take on other theories besides SU(2) gauge theory with adjoint fermions in the future. We will use clover improved lattice fermions with stout smeared gauge links, in order to reduce lattice artifacts.<br/><br/>Because our code will be made public, the scientific community will benefit by being able to use our code for other studies. Our analysis code will be flexible and in fact not tied to the gauge group and representation. Thus it can be used for studying 0++ states in other theories, including quantum chromodynamics. As a result, a significant outcome of the present project is reusable code with wide application.<br/><br/>We will train students in theoretical and supercomputing skills, providing a path toward careers in scientific computing. We will create increased interest in ""beyond the standard model"" physics at Rensselaer, broadening the exposure of students to current trends in high energy physics. We will perform outreach to a middle school, and develop lesson plans built around activities that teach concepts associated with our research."
0.348587,"Part 1<br/><br/>Changes of a galaxy's properties over time are driven by the quantity of its cold gas, the raw material from which stars form. Thus, understanding the properties of a galaxy's cold gas component will tell us both how the star formation process changes over time and how this affects galaxies. Using a recently completed survey of carbon monoxide gas in a sample of nearby galaxies, the proposers will (1) measure how the molecular gas is used up, in order to test how star formation in the galaxies is affected; (2) map the locations of this gas in the galaxies to determine if/how these locations affect star formation; and (3) measure how the gas is flowing into and out of the galaxies to determine how this affects structural changes in the galaxies over time. In particular, some questions that can be answered from this research include: What factors affect the conversion of molecular gas into stars? How is molecular gas structured? How do galaxies grow and age? This proposal will provide insight into the process of galaxy formation and our understanding of these objects.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>This proposal plans to combine spatially resolved spectroscopy of carbon monoxide molecular gas, ionized gas and stellar populations for a sample of 125 nearby galaxies. Measuring spatially-resolved molecular gas depletion time scales as a function of various galaxy properties, using diagnostics of spectral lines to probe diffuse molecular gas, and constraining the rates of gas in- and outflow for these galaxies has the potential to add greatly to our understanding of star formation in normal galaxies.<br/><br/>Observations of galaxies across a range of redshifts allow us to witness the growth and aging of the galaxy population. It has long been recognized that these processes are driven by the rise and fall of star formation, which is ultimately linked to the supply of cold gas. Further progress in understanding the regulation of star formation in galaxies, however, requires additional observational constraints beyond the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By exploiting a unique combination of the largest, most homogeneous interferometric CO survey of galaxies to date (the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution, or EDGE) and one of the principal ongoing optical integral field unit (IFU) surveys (CALIFA), the project team will confront models of star formation and galaxy evolution with uniform, high quality measurements of gas masses and star formation rates, supplemented by a vast array of additional data, including star formation history, stellar mass, nuclear activity, and the metallicity and kinematics of the gas and stars. These studies will be conducted on a spatially resolved basis across a well-defined sample that is representative of the nearby Universe, and will thus inform future studies of star formation and mass assembly at all redshifts undertaken by JWST and ALMA."
0.32,"With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-B) and Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) programs are supporting computer-based fundamental research of Dr. Charles Doubleday at Columbia University. This research seeks a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of chemical reactions by computing the sequence of atomic motions as starting materials are transformed into products. Dr. Doubleday uses a combination of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics to understand how energy flows from starting materials into products. This type of calculation allows important questions to be addressed; for example, why one product may be favored over another. The understanding achieved in these calculations will enable better experimental control over the products of chemical reactions. An important component of this project is the training of undergraduate students in scientific research. Since research is collaborative and students learn from each other, the work fosters group skills as well as individual achievement. In collaborations with colleagues at Columbia and other institutions, Dr. Doubleday helps train students in the use of computational methods. In one project, the focus is on the active center of a class of powerful antibiotics, with the goal of understanding and control. As the principles uncovered by this research become incorporated into applied areas, potential benefits could include greater understanding and control over chemical processes important in atmospheric and life processes.<br/><br/>The computational procedure involves quasiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics, in which nuclear forces are computed at each step by an electronic structure method, usually density functional theory. In applying this method to several enediyne cyclizations, the Doubleday group has recently found a dynamic isotope effect in which isotopic selectivity occurs in the product, as a result of competition between recrossing to reactant on a vibrational timescale and isotope-dependent intramolecular vibrational redistribution. An important part of the proposal is to carry out quasiclassical simulations of reactions in condensed phase using QM/MM (Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics) techniques. The proposal describes a statistically converged procedure for quasiclassical sampling of transition states in condensed phase."
0.18,"Metabolomics is the study of low molecular weight molecules found within cells and biological systems. It has emerged for deciphering the complex time-related concentration, activity and flux of metabolites in biological samples. Multiple analytical platforms such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have been used in metabolomics. Unlike other analytical platforms, the comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry system provides a much increased separation capacity, chemical selectivity and sensitivity for the analysis of metabolites. The aim of this project is to infer metabolic networks from the measurements of metabolites using this high-throughput comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry system. To achieve a high accuracy metabolic network construction, an innovative peak detection algorithm will be first developed for simultaneous baseline removal, smoothing and peak picking steps, as well as the statistical assessment of peak confidence level. The investigators will then develop an innovative peak alignment algorithm based on global comparison using point matching algorithm as well as considering measurement error and outlier detection. Once an accurate alignment peak table is created, metabolic networks will be created using Bayesian ensemble method, which is Bayesian model averaging, to find meaningful pairwise interactions and associations among sets of metabolite peaks as well as to account for uncertainty of network complexity. In particular, the pathway information will be incorporated into network constructions for weighting each network constructed by several different approaches.<br/><br/>The comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry platform can not only leverage the peak capacity issue in current metabolomics, but also brings much improved chemical selectivity and sensitivity for metabolomics analyses. The developed statistical and computational approaches will lead to new methodology for data pre-processing and metabolic network construction for the analysis of high-throughput data. The metabolic network construction system developed from this project will enable identification of consistent metabolite mechanisms and pathways for numerous organisms and diseases in real time. Thus this research will have broader impacts for biomedical research, medicine and public health. The methods developed in this research can also be applied to the analysis of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry based metabolomics data."
0.173322,"Over 10,000 species of grasses are known to science. Grasses proliferated rapidly, obscuring their historical relationships. This project integrates three broad approaches in a study of grass diversification using contemporary methods to reconstruct the genealogy of the grasses. Next generation DNA sequencing methods will be used to determine complete chloroplast genomes and subregions of the nuclear genome from at least 100 species. Bioinformatics analyses will explore patterns and rates of DNA sequence evolution. Studies of development, especially in leaves, will be used to test whether particular adaptations are correlated with historical migrations into new habitats. <br/><br/>Grasses are of fundamental economic and ecological importance. Rice, wheat, maize and other cereals supply half of human dietary calories. Wild grasses predominate over 25% of Earth's terrestrial landscape. A better understanding of their relationships is fundamental to predicting the response of grasslands and cereal crops to environmental change. Analyses of sequence data will clarify relationships and have broad application in evolutionary studies. Ecological adaptations will be better understood when viewed in a developmental context. An image-rich web site will be established, with content in English and Spanish, with information on grass structure, classification, and evolution. The new framework of grass relationships and accompanying web resources will appeal to a broad range of users and promote international collaborations."

The molecular specificity of the confocal channel, and the cellular and nuclear morphology changes from the backscatter channel, will serve to validate TDI and identify the biological mechanisms that correspond to the features observed in drug-response TDS spectrograms. They will use the multichannel system to study two well-known classes of compounds: mitochondrial toxins and Raf kinase inhibitors. TDI then will be applied to study apoptosis/necrosis, mitosis/cytokinesis and biochemical/biomechanical oscillations. These processes are important markers for drug<br/>efficacy and present strong physiological responses that make them ideally suited to study with<br/>dynamic imaging. This research will establish the types of intracellular motion that are detected by tissue dynamic imaging, the sensitivity, and the specificity to different types of mechanism of drug action.

The successful completion of the proposed research will lay the foundation for tissue dynamics imaging to become a unique imaging tool with a broad array of future biomedical applications. These potential applications include the discovery of new drug candidates with lower side effects and lower costs to consumers, the selection of cancer chemotherapy specifically tuned to the patient to improve cancer remission and patient quality of life, and improvement in the success rate of in vitro fertilization to reduce health-care costs and remove medical complications of multiple births.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) through the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program, and by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET)."
0.723701,"This research intends to determine the importance of genetic variation in the two separate genomes that occur in all animal cells: the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. These genomes work together to form the enzymes in one metabolic pathway, the Oxidative Phosphorylation metabolic pathway. The Oxidative Phosphorylation pathway makes the vast majority of ATP energy produced in animals breathing oxygen. To investigate the importance of genetic variation in this pathway, the research goals include 1) determining the sequencing variation among all the genes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, (2) quantifying the differences in RNA expression for these genes, and (3) determining the functional and biochemical consequences of both protein polymorphisms and gene expression. To understand the naturally occurring genetic differences, this research uses evolutionary analyses of the two genomes among populations of the salt marsh minnow, F. heteroclitus, that are distributed along a steep thermal cline where southern populations are >12C warmer than northern populations. This clinal variation in temperature is associated with adaptive changes in enzyme kinetics and enzyme expression. This approach integrates the physiological effects of temperature on protein variants, nucleotide polymorphisms and quantitative variation in RNA expression, and defines biologically important differences by defining changes that have evolved by natural selection (i.e., are evolutionary adaptations). Combining the discovery of nucleotide variation, quantitative variation in RNA expression, and the functional consequences of this variation will enhance our understanding of the evolution of two genomes and how constraints and conflict within and between genomes affect evolutionary processes. By analyzing a complete metabolic pathway, we will gain a broad understanding of how adaptive evolution affects changes among many interacting genes to achieve adaptive physiological changes. Thus, these data provide a unique perspective of how global warming may affect the physiology and evolution of animals.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This research will enhance undergraduate and graduate student training and education in scientific research using DNA sequencing, biochemistry and physiology. To enhance the participation of under-represented groups, minority undergraduates will be recruited through our interactions with science programs that are geared for minorities at the University of Miami. Additionally, society and the science community will benefit from the empirical data on the relationship between changing thermal environments and nucleotide variation across many whole mitochondrial genomes. These data, which will be publically available, will provide a rich database for the Fundulus research community, physiologists working on mitochondrial function, and researchers modeling haploid genome evolution."
2.593502,"PI: Brian D. Gregory (University of Pennsylvania)<br/><br/>Co-PIs: Eric Lyons and Mark Beilstein (University of Arizona)<br/><br/>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of molecules gaining attention for their roles in various biological processes. lncRNAs are defined by the fact that they do not code for proteins and are therefore not mRNAs. In addition, they do not fit into other well-defined small silencing RNA-producing categories such as small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite the importance of lncRNAs in development, epigenetic modification, and stress responses, there is still much to be learned about their structure, protein interactions, and functions, especially in model and crop plant species. This project will address this significant gap using a combination of genomic, evolutionary, and bioinformatics approaches. It is anticipated that the data, web-accessible genome analytical tools, and data management systems developed by the project will provide novel insights into plant gene expression regulation by lncRNAs, and provide important new findings and resources for studies focused on the improvement of numerous crop and genetic model plants. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide interdisciplinary research training in RNA biology, computational science and evolutionary biology for students and postdoctoral associates. In addition, the project will develop an interdisciplinary course entitled ""Applied Concepts in RNA Biology"" that will leverage large-scale computing and datasets to understand various aspects of the role of RNA in biological systems. This project-based course will teach the fundamentals of RNA biology, next-generation sequencing techniques, distributed and high performance computing, data-intensive science, and collaborative research techniques that will be used in student-driven research projects. The course will be taught simultaneously at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona, with two-way audio/video conferencing and lecture topics alternatively taught at each site. All project outcomes will be made readily accessible to the broader research community through a project website (https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/EPIC-CoGe_Tutorial), the iPlant Collaborative and long-term repositories such as GenBank and the Short Read Archive (SRA). <br/><br/>This project is uniquely positioned to provide insights into the structure and function of lncRNAs, and their interaction with specific epigenomic regulatory modifications in the genome. The specific goals of the project are to define a subset of lncRNAs that are important for proper gene regulation in both normal development and stress response. Specifically, the project will focus on identifying and functionally characterizing those lncRNAs that are (1) nuclear, (2) highly structured, (3) stress responsive, (4) protein bound, and (5) evolutionary conserved in genetic models (Eutrema salsugineum and Arabidopsis thaliana) and in crop species (Camelina sativa, Brassica rapa, Zea mays, and Sorghum bicolor), focusing on their roles in stress adaptation. Finally, the project will expand EPIC-CoGe, a central repository for plant epigenomics data across all species, with advanced data integration, visualization, and analysis tools to allow for the integration of functional genomics data to provide new insight into genome-wide epigenomic interactions."
1.035334,"Intellectual merit<br/>The physical properties of globular proteins are a topic of intense investigation and practical importance. Multiple approaches have been deployed to understand the determinants of stability and plasticity of these vital biomolecules. Among the methods that are most useful, but so far much underutilized, is nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) at high pressure. The combination of gentle perturbation and residue-level description afforded by this technique has excellent potential for exposing novel architectural principles in proteins. The proposed research will combine molecular biology, amino acid sequence analysis, and high-pressure NMR methods to explore the native state of a set of monomeric bacterial and algal hemoglobins. The work will investigate the original notion that a common internal cavity network is a crucial entity governing conformational changes concerted with ligand binding and volume dynamics. Studies will be extended to related proteins from organisms that live in high pressure environments to enhance the description of the molecular attributes of globins functioning under extreme conditions of pressure and low temperature. Because the globins of interest are enzymatic and of ancient origin, the results will pertain to multiple fields of inquiry besides protein physical chemistry, including phylogenetics, heme chemistry, and molecular evolution. These ramifications offer an opportunity for laboratory and classroom training of students with diverse interests.<br/><br/>Broader impact<br/>The broader impact of the proposed research will be achieved through a combination of teaching, training, outreach, and dissemination. Research results will be incorporated in a biophysics undergraduate course in spectroscopy and in a graduate course in biophysical methods. Training will be provided to graduate and undergraduate students, including REU summer students, working directly on the project. Participation in outreach activities will include lab tours for high-school students along with research and career presentations to attract women and underrepresented groups to STEM fields. Participation in the Biophysics Research for Baltimore Teens summer program (organized by the Program in Molecular Biophysics of Johns Hopkins University) will focus on introducing selected high-school students of Baltimore City to scientific research. Dissemination will be through publications, lectures at other institutions, participation in conferences, and database depositions."
0.342695,"Despite tremendous advances in cryptography and communication security, information attacks -- both passive such as eavesdropping, and active such as unauthorized data injection --, can severely impair the functioning of modern infrastructural systems that combine cyber communication systems and networked physical components. The ability of adversaries to monitor transmitted data or introduce false information for sustained periods of time whilst staying undetected can result in leakage of sensitive information or cause critical damages to underlying systems with consequences ranging from airline collisions, power blackouts to malfunctioning nuclear reactors. In this research, rigorous frameworks are developed to study vulnerabilities of cyber physical systems to such persistent security threats with the goal of designing novel and resilient system controllers. The systematic approach to study adversarial behavior will not only enable effective cyber policing, but also lay a platform for developing technologies to prevent the next generation of cyber terrorism that aims to cripple basic infrastructural systems in energy, healthcare, transportation etc. The education and outreach components will facilitate an enhanced awareness in society of potential vulnerabilities of the burgeoning Internet of Things and the path towards cyber physical security.<br/><br/>This research will study two key challenges in securing cyber physical systems: preventing retrieval of physical system information through continually monitored cyber flows, and limiting disruption to system operations through continually hacked cyber flows. Incorporating the strengths of information theoretic security and statistical inference methodologies into a dynamic programming framework which models cyber physical system evolution as a function of external information and internal control, this research will study quantitatively the trade-offs between information security and the system operational performance, and through the process, develop attack detection and mitigation methodologies."
0.199208,"Threats are all around us: from the mundane, such as auto accidents, to the existential, such as global pandemics or nuclear war. How we perceive and manage these threats is related to a number of factors including how ""real"" the threat feels (its risk salience), our confidence in the sources of information alerting us to the threat and its potential consequences, our faith in the effectiveness of an intervention and in our ability to employ it, and our reliance upon psychological leanings that propel us to being risk-tolerant or risk-averse. The newly emerging Zika virus is a window into many of these facets, and a critically-important opportunity for those engaged in public health risk communication. This research examines how social, scientific, and policy cues influence the U.S. public's appreciation of the risk of Zika virus over time, as well as the public's receptivity to clinical, environmental, and behavioral interventions. By collecting a series of four cross-sectional population surveys over the course of a year, this research illustrates how risk salience evolves, and the extent to which it may be influenced by specific communication and information channels. Analyses reveal how social, scientific, and policy discourse contribute to public understandings of risk and further our understandings of communication strategies. Understanding how messaging changes with evolving scientific knowledge improves risk communication for future threats. These findings contribute to the literature of risk communication, which is often comprised of retrospective analyses of messages, rather than prospective studies of messaging in times of uncertainty. It also helps develop more refined and effective risk communication strategies when populations are faced with the threat of a novel pathogen. Overall, this research contributes to several disciplinary perspectives, notably those of risk assessment, hazard-related decision making, and public health risk communication.<br/><br/>The rising attention to the Zika virus offers an opportunity to examine how risk salience evolves in real-time as the threat approaches. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapies for the Zika viral infection, and there is still limited scientific understanding of the virus itself, the vectors, the disease pathogenesis, or even the epidemiology. The opportunity to measure and chart the U.S. public's perception of this threat - and how it is influenced by social, scientific, and policy cues - is time-bound, as the geographic exposure to the virus expands over time, and the data are ephemeral. This research examines how social, scientific, and policy cues influence the US public's perception of the risk over time, as well as the public's receptivity to clinical, environmental, and behavioral interventions. The specific aims of the research are to: (1) chart the trajectory of risk salience as exposure and certainty of the Zika virus increases; (2) identify and analyze the impact of social, scientific, and policy cues and discourse on risk salience; and (3) describe and analyze group differences in the evolving attitudes related to risk perception, as well as receptivity to policy, programmatic, and clinical interventions. Two data sets are developed to investigate these research aims. The first is a repeated cross-sectional national phone survey with an oversample of women of child-bearing age in the US Southern Tier (selected as a sub-population of particular vulnerability), totaling 1,200 respondents. These data are collected quarterly over a year-long period. In parallel with the primary data, a second data set quantifies the number and type of social, scientific, and policy cues observed in sentinel media sources during the time period immediately preceding the survey work. The research team merges these media data with the primary data and tests for their association with respondents? risk salience. The findings contribute to the overall literature of risk communication, which is often comprised of retrospective analyses of messages, rather than prospective studies of messaging in times of uncertainty. It is possible that messaging will change over time as the number of Zika cases increases in the US, as the number of microcephalic infant births increase, and as dramatic stories are reported with greater frequency in the press. Demonstrating how this messaging changes with evolving scientific knowledge improves risk communication for future threats."

0.425999,"The PI plans to work on a variety of problems, particularly asymptotic problems, in the general area of integrable systems. Two key tools will play a prominent role in the PI's work: Riemann-Hilbert Problems (RHP) and the non-linear, non-commutative steepest descent method, on the one hand, and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) on the other. RHPs can be viewed as the natural, non-commutative generalization of the scalar integral representations of the classical special functions, and just as the classical steepest descent method allows one to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the classical functions, so too the non-linear, non-commutative steepest descent method allows one to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of modern integrable systems such as the KdV equation and the Painleve equations, amongst many others. RMT, and in particular, the eigenvalues of random matrices, provide an extremely versatile tool to describe the behavior of a wide variety of stochastic phenomena when the underlying variables are no longer independent. Amongst the problems that the PI will address with these tools are: the asymptotic behavior of the modes of a laser as the Fresnel number goes to infinity; the behavior of random n-band matrices of size N as n,N go to infinity; universality for general orthogonal and symplectic matrix ensembles; the perturbation theory of the focusing Non-Linear Schroedinger Equation on the line.<br/><br/><br/>It is an extraordinary fact that the eigenvalues of random matrices provide a quantitative model for a wide variety of statistical phenomena from physics, pure and applied mathematics, and engineering. Applications of RMT range from the analysis of resonances in nuclear scattering theory, to the analysis of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line, in analytic number theory.Quite spectacularly, and surprisingly, even the arrival times between buses in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca, have been shown to obey random matrix theory statistics! RMT as a discipline has two components: the development of random matrix theory per se, and the application of the theory to new physical and mathematical problems. The work of the PI will impact both components. In the theory of integrable systems, two of the problems in particular proposed by the PI, arise directly from technology, viz., laser mode asymptotics, and the effect of perturbations on fiber optical transmission systems. The PI and his collaborators are also writing basic texts on RHPs and RMT aimed at the researchers as well as advanced graduate students entering the field."
0.48,"Cellular signaling is fundamental to many biological processes, from the development of embryos to the growth of cancerous cells. Signaling systems are composed of a cluster of genes and their expression products, proteins, which can interact with each other by controlling the expression of the corresponding gene. Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the expression of a group of genes within signaling systems and do so by binding to a specific DNA sequence motif upstream of targeting genes. By measuring the amount of transcription factors from a population of cells with traditional biochemistry assays, biologists have shown that environmental inputs (i.e., stresses or extracellular ligands) can alter the concentrations of transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The objective of this project is to understand how individual cells encode external inputs as time-based signals and how these signals are transmitted to downstream genes, and to examine how the single cell behavior differs from the behavior of the population of cells. The collaborative team of investigators from the California Institute of Technology (US) and the University of Edinburgh (UK) will use new single-cell measurements based on fluorescent protein and time-lapse optical microscopy techniques can provide new and distinct information about the signal processing capabilities of individual cells. Through its broader impacts, this project will promote understanding of the dynamic nature of cellular information processing. Furthermore, this project will provide new techniques and tools to perturb and control cell functions.<br/><br/>Cellular signaling is fundamental to many biological processes, from embryo development to disease progression. It is often considered to be a continuous and concentration-based process, where extracellular input is encoded in the concentrations of one or more transcription factors (TFs) or other regulators, which are in turn decoded to control gene expression in a continuous fashion. In contrast, recent single-cell studies have revealed that many central TFs are activated in stochastic pulses in response to inputs. Examples include nuclear factor-kappa-B and p53 in mammals, and the general stress regulator Msn2 in yeast. In these systems, inputs generate pulses of TF activity, which are then decoded by target promoters in a dynamic fashion. The extent of signal encoding and decoding in pulsing systems as well as the potential physiological functions of these systems remain largely unexplored. This project will address these questions in budding yeast through collaborative efforts between the Swain and the Elowitz laboratories. The team will integrate single-cell time-lapse microscopy, microfluidics, and techniques from information theory to measure the information transfer within dynamic signaling systems by investigating the encoding and decoding of TF dynamics in single cells. This project will contribute to the understanding of three aspects of dynamic signaling: First, the team will produce an extensive dataset of input- output relationship between stresses and TF dynamics, providing a comprehensive understanding of dynamic cellular responses. Second, information theoretical analysis of single-cell signaling will provide a more comprehensive view of dynamics-based information transduction and pulse-based signal encoding and decoding. Third, it will explore the physiological roles of dynamic pulsing, to open up the possibility of controlling cellular behaviors through the perturbation of TF dynamics. Through its broader impacts, this analysis of pulse-based signaling in cells should allow scientists to understand the design principles of natural signaling systems.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council."
0.304897,"There is strong cosmological and astrophysical evidence for non-baryonic, cold dark matter as a major constituent of the universe. The nature of Dark Matter, so far elusive, constitutes one of the most fundamental questions in science. Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology. A compelling explanation for what might constitute dark matter is the existence of hitherto unknown Weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), and a world-wide experimental effort is on-going to test this hypothesis. This project is part of that effort. <br/><br/>Immersive research experiences developed in collaboration with programs focused on underrepresented groups will enhance diversity at the graduate and undergrad levels. Innovative partnerships with Adler Planetarium and the School of the Art Institute in Chicago (SAIC) will bring Dark Matter science to broad and diverse audiences. Visitor experiences at the Adler Planetarium (450,000 visitors/year) will be enhanced by the participation of DAMIC scientists and the integration of visualizations of particle interactions with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). In collaboration with SAIC, an advanced STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math) program will inspire art students as well as experienced professionals (e.g. designers) via explorations of software and modeling tools to display current scientific data.<br/><br/>The Dark Matter In CCDs (DAMIC) experiment searches for low mass WIMPs with scientific-grade silicon CCDs. With this novel technique, WIMP-induced signals are detected with an unprecedented low energy threshold, and unique spatial resolution. DAMIC-100, to be installed in 2015 at the SNOLAB underground laboratory in Sudbury, Canada, will have an active detector mass of 100 g. This award provides support for the participation of the U. Chicago group to DAMIC-100. They have played a major role in the DAMIC R&D phase and in the construction of the 100 g detector. The group will have strong responsibilities in the test and calibration of the CCDs, in the installation and commissioning of the experiment, and in the data analysis. In addition, a calibration of the nuclear recoil energy scale will be performed at U. Chicago with a neutron source."

The instrument will allow research in different areas including organic synthesis and materials, peptide, forensic and inorganic chemistry and enhance the teaching program at the University. The research will impact areas of biological and environmental interest including DNA stability, anti-viral peptides, precursors to novel drugs and gas adsorption materials. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at Florida Gulf Coast University. The NMR will also increase the chemistry department's capability to collaborate with local law enforcement institutions on drug identification as well as with local bio-tech companies.<br/><br/>The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as synthesizing (a) bio-inspired ionic liquids; (b) medicinally relevant natural products; (c) bioactive molecules; (d) studying structure and function of membrane disruptive anti-viral peptides; (e) studying forensic applications of NMR with concentration in long-term structural and chemical stability of DNA; and (f) studying metal-organic materials from pillared discrete structures."
0.24,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. One technique for exploring physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is in making precision measurements of SM model atomic parameters such as the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. This award will develop the accelerator technology necessary for such a precision measurement of the neutron EDM. This project is to explore essential tools for exploration of physics beyond Standard model of particle physics. Tools for this exploration include a neutron beam storage ring, polarized proton beams and high power beams. Besides the basic physics, high power beams can be important to ""nuclear waste"" incineration, which can be important to national security.<br/><br/>This award will allow the study of synchro-betatron coupling of polarized beams relevant to the measurement of EDM, continuing exploration of a neutron beam storage ring, and envelope dynamics of high power proton accelerators. The group will study spin dynamics and synchrotron-betatron coupling of all electric rings that are relevant to polarized beams and will continue to study the neutron beam storage ring. The longitudinal focusing of longitudinal phase space has been explored. The transverse dynamics in using periodic quadrupole and sextupole magnets will be explored to fulfill the initial design of a storage ring. TEST beam experiments will be carried out to test numerical simulations for high power beams."
0.44,"Exploring new states of matter is a fundamental quest. The strong interaction sector of the Standard Model is described by the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as a quantum field theory of quarks and gluons. Such quarks and gluons are deeply confined in normal matter. However when normal matter is heated to a high enough temperature, it changes into a new deconfined form of QCD matter directly made of the quarks and gluons. Such a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) briefly occupied the Universe at about a few microseconds after the ""Big Bang"", and has now been (re-)created as the hottest matter ever in laboratory by heavy ion collisions (""Little Bang""). Its properties are measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the quark-gluon matter created in heavy ion collisions is strongly-interacting both prior to and after reaching thermal equilibrium. Exactly how such strongly interacting nature arises in the many-body setting from the fundamental QCD theory, is a challenging problem that lacks a deep understanding. This project will investigate this missing link and seek to develop effective descriptions of the matter both in and out of equilibrium. The results will advance our understanding of QCD confinement, provide fresh insights into jet quenching mechanism, make significant progress in search of QCD topological effects, and reduce existing uncertainties on the pre-thermal stage. The expected outcome will contribute to our understanding of fundamental questions such as ""how the color confinement phenomenon arises"", and ""how the experimentally observed properties of the quark-gluon matter in and out of equilibrium emerge from QCD"".<br/><br/>The study supported by this award concerns the exploration of new forms of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These activities embody important interdisciplinary aspects, as they are expected to have a profound impact on other areas of physics, ranging from cosmology, supernova, compact stars, to supersymmetric theories, string theories as well as condensed matter physics. This project integrates research with education through mentoring of graduate, as well as undergraduate students. This project will actively pursue a five-year educational outreach plan to develop educational software for computer desktops and mobile devices that utilizes visualization and simulations to demonstrate concepts related to the ""Physics of Extreme Matter"" in an interactive, engaging, and children-friendly manner."
0.469,"Non-technical description:<br/>The answer to the question ""what time is it?"" ultimately traces back to master clocks that are based on the internal ticking of atoms. Increasing the accuracy of these master clocks has in the past enabled such innovations as the GPS systems that we use in our cars and smartphones to locate our position on the globe. Future improvements in clocks can be expected to enable similar innovations that are only just beginning to be imagined. The present project seeks to extend the scope of the science and technology we can achieve by keeping track of time ever more accurately, using molecules instead of atoms. Molecules present the possibility of a quantum clock based on different physics than atomic clocks: nuclear vibrations rather than electronic transitions. Simple molecules that consist of two atoms will be created near the temperature of absolute zero and trapped in standing waves of light to ensure nearly complete isolation from the environment. These strontium molecules possess very well defined internal energy states that allow precise manipulation and probing with laser light. This clock is sensitive to variations in the electron-to-proton mass ratio that may occur as the universe evolves, and to yet undiscovered forces that might appear at nanometer scales. <br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>A new class of ultracold diatomic molecules based on laser-cooled strontium atoms was recently demonstrated by the primary investigator's research group. This work (based on optical trapping, manipulation, and imaging of these dimers) will enable precision measurements in molecular physics as well as tests of fundamental laws that may indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. Initial work indicates that by applying atomic lattice-clock techniques to this molecule in both the excited and ground states, a direct measurement of the nonadiabatic Coriolis mixing angles of the molecular wavefunctions can be performed; these angles are critical for describing weak molecular bonding near the atomic continuum. This project will further characterize the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic behavior in these weakly bound systems. Additionally, tightly bound ultracold ground-state strontium dimers will be created for vibrational spectroscopy, or a molecular vibrational clock. If the mass scaling of the van der Waals type interatomic interaction is better understood, this clock can potentially improve the knowledge of nanometer-scale mass-dependent forces by several orders of magnitude. When the systematic effects of lattice spectroscopy of this molecule are better characterized and state-insensitive lattice trapping is optimized as part of this project, this molecular clock can set the best model-independent limit on the stability of the electron-to-proton mass ratio. Robust molecular clocks have applications in geodesy, navigation, and tests of fundamental science. Special efforts are made to involve young public school students from local New York City neighborhoods and expose them to the day-to-day work of scientists."
0.375,"****Technical Abstract**** <br/>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques will be used to explore the dynamics of quantum solids and fluids in systems where striking new phenomena have been observed at low temperatures. These systems include solid 4He in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 K for which a large unexpected quantum plasticity has been reported, and clusters of atoms (3He, HD, H2) confined to the interior of nanostructures for which enhanced quantum effects occur in the restricted geometries. The latter are predicted to exhibit new thermodynamic features because the confining dimension is less that the De Broglie wavelengths and the energy states will be fully quantized. In both cases new high sensitivity solid state NMR techniques will developed to study the microscopic dynamics of these systems non-invasively. The studies will determine the effect of quantum plasticity on the tunneling of 3He impurities in solid 4He, and the nature of the quantization of nanoclusters of atoms trapped in nanoporous materials that hold promise for improved capabilities of hydrogen storage. The project will support the training of a PhD student in the design and application of NMR techniques for observing signals from very low densities of atoms and molecules in extreme conditions. These techniques will be important for a number of applications in industry such as geological exploration and for investigating defects in structural materials. <br/><br/>****Non-Technical Abstract**** <br/>The fundamental microscopic motion of atoms and molecules is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, and while the general principles of quantum mechanics has been verified in many laboratory experiments, the behavior of simple atoms in extreme conditions of density and temperature has not been fully explored for the simplest materials, such as the weakly interacting quantum fluids and solids comprised of light atoms and molecules such as helium and hydrogen. The dynamics of the constituent atoms is determined by the wave functions describing the atoms and in its most simple terms the wave functions of the atoms overlap and as a result the atoms can exchange places. As a result of this unique quantum mechanical aspect atoms can tunnel through a lattice structure independent of temperature. This tunneling motion will be exploited to probe the microscopic dynamics of solid helium for which large anomalies have been observed in the elastic properties of very pure crystals at low temperatures. The project will use magnetic resonance techniques to carry out non-invasive measurements of the atomic motions in these quantum solids using approaches similar to but not identical to those used in magnetic resonance imaging in medical applications. Students and collaborators working on the project will design new magnetic resonance techniques needed for the experiments and the applications of the new technologies will be of interest to applications in industry such as geological exploration and investigation of structural materials."
0.42,"Srinivasan Iyengar of Indiana University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to continue the development of a combined quantum wavepacket molecular dynamics technique originally developed by the Iyengar group during the previous funding cycle. This work addresses one of the most challenging problems in modern theoretical chemical physics: the combined computational study of electronic structure and nuclear dynamics. QWAIMD involves the simultaneous dynamics of electrons and nuclei though the synergy of quantum wavepacket dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics. It allows the computational implementation of a ""self-contained black-box"" technique for dynamics of electrons and nuclei that does not require a priori knowledge of the potential energy surface. These novel methods are being used to study the vibrational properties of hydrogen bonded clusters. <br/><br/>One of the most challenging issues in modern theoretical chemistry is determining the proper way to combine the inherently quantum mechanical description of the electrons in molecules with the description of molecular motion. Molecular motion is commonly treated using classical mechanics but in many cases quantum mechanical treatment is necessary.

If successful, the work will have wide impact on the development of proper descriptions of a number of important application topics including hydrogen transfer reactions in biological enzyme systems, solvation assisted kinetics in atmospheric reactions and hydrogen transfer in fuel cells. The work is, thus, expected to have a broader impact in biology, atmospheric science and materials chemistry and, through the PI's extensive outreach work, on students from under-represented minorities."
0.3,"1264051<br/>Park, Sheldon J. <br/><br/>Temperature sensitive (ts) mutants are widely used in functional studies but are cumbersome to generate, since a separate library screening is needed for each target protein. Using high throughput yeast assays, we will engineer ts intein mutants that are only active at a permissive temperature. By characterizing engineered intein mutants, we will develop a mechanism based understanding of temperature sensitivity. The engineered ts intein will be used to design a structurally independent domain that can be genetically fused to a heterologous protein to send it to different subcellular compartments in a temperature dependent manner. Controlling the localization of a protein with temperature may be useful to regulate their in vivo activity and generate useful conditional mutants. We will demonstrate the design by targeting model transcription factors, rtTA and Gal4, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a temperature dependent manner, and show that their transcriptional activities correlate with their nuclear targeting. We will also show that the cytoplasmic kinase, Ste7, can be localized to different cellular compartments using engineered inteins. The designed targeting module will allow dynamic control of the localization, and hence the function, of intracellular proteins using the growth temperature, and simplify the engineering of new ts mutants based on simple cloning rather than library screening. <br/><br/>Ts mutants are commonly used in research but are difficult to engineer predictably. The physical basis of temperature sensitivity is also not well understood. We will engineer ts intein mutants to design a modular targeting domain that can be fused to a heterologous protein to regulate its subcellular localization in a temperature dependent manner. Facile construction of temperature sensitive conditional mutants will be useful for studying protein function in vivo. The PI participates in a broad range of initiatives at the department, school, and university levels to improve pre-collegiate, undergraduate, and graduate education. The current grant will support continued participation in these outreach programs, and provide additional research opportunities to both K-12 and undergraduate students. There will be new teaching materials developed based on the proposed experiments to advance engineering education both in and out of the lab. By implementing the described experiments, the students will learn essential synthetic biology based on modular construction of biological components.<br/>This award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology."
0.6,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Photochemical reactions within molecular crystals provide a way to transform light energy into nanoscale mechanical motion. Progress in nanoscale photomechanical materials requires an interdisciplinary approach that combines materials chemistry and physical characterization. In this joint proposal, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, the Bardeen research group's expertise in molecular crystalline materials, optical spectroscopy and microscopy will be complemented by the Mueller group's strengths in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and computational chemistry, in order to pursue a research program with two main thrusts:<br/>1) New photomechanical materials. We will concentrate on thermally reversible photomechanical systems that can operate with a single light source. To make photomechanical elements that can function on the nanoscale, we will look for systems where changes in the crystal shape can be induced intrinsically without relying on specialized irradiation conditions. Two new types of photochemical ""engines"" will also be investigated: the unimolecular Dewar isomerization of anthracene, and thermally induced polymorphic phase changes. We will also develop the capability to make uniform arrays of molecular crystal plates as a step toward making devices based on photomechanical molecular crystals.<br/>2) Physical characterization of the solid-state reaction dynamics and their connection to crystal deformation. This part of the project will involve using optical, x-ray, NMR and computational methods to understand how molecular-level reactions drive large-scale crystal shape changes in model systems. After the photochemical reaction has been initiated, the structure of the photoproduct and how the reaction affects the crystal packing will be determined using solid-state NMR, x-ray diffraction, and computational methods. We will also use optical and scanning probe microscopy to map out how the crystal geometry changes as a function of these parameters. Information from these experiments will be combined to provide a holistic picture of the photomechanical process on multiple length scales and timescales.<br/><br/>NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Machines that function on length scales smaller than biological cells could lead to revolutionary advances in fields like medicine and defense. But there are many questions that must be answered before this goal can be achieved, including how to produce such structures, how to provide them with power, and how to control their motion. Our approach involves self-assembling photochemically reactive molecules within a crystal, whose shape and size is controlled by the preparation conditions. Because the molecules are organized within a crystal, they move in concert to expand or bend the overall nanostructure. The research in this proposal will assess whether these nanoscale photochemical ""engines"" can be used to manipulate objects on nanometer to micron length scales. We also want to gain a predictive understanding of how molecular-level chemical changes can combine together to create much larger shape changes in the crystals. In addition, outreach programs based on this research will be used to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in science. U.C. Riverside is a Hispanic Serving Institution, with strong connections to the surrounding public schools. We are currently designing and implementing outreach modules for 1st, 2nd and 4th grade classes that are consistent with the California State Standards for science education. With undergraduate volunteers, we are bringing these modules to local elementary schools, like Taft Elementary, a local Title I school whose student body is more than 50% Hispanic."

These alloys exhibit unique optical, magnetic, and catalytic behaviors that make them attractive for technologies ranging from near-infrared (NIR) imaging to heterogeneous catalysis. Prof. Millstone and her students will investigate the impact of particle-ligand interactions, intermolecular ligand forces, and solvent-ligand chemistry to tune both the atomic composition and atom distribution throughout the nanoparticle.

0.089,"Christine Corbett Moran is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the California Institute of Technology. Upcoming space missions will enable astronomers to observationally test theoretical models for supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth for the first time. How SMBHs formed so quickly, during the first billion years of the Universe, remains a central puzzle of cosmology and galaxy evolution. One candidate formation pathway is through supermassive stars (SMSs) that could have formed in the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds. At the end of their lifetimes, the collapse of SMSs may result in black holes with seed masses large enough to be the progenitors of SMBHs; powerful thermonuclear explosions with no remnants; or black hole-explosion combinations. Yet our understanding of SMS collapse, its set of outcomes, and their signatures is in its infancy. Moran's research program will comprehensively address SMS evolution, producing predictions that can be tested by upcoming missions to help untangle the formation channel of SMBHs. Moran's program also includes a significant educational component, which will give a computing school, the Summer Space Programming Challenge to Pasadena area high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>Much theoretical work is still needed to understand SMS collapse/explosion dynamics and to predict their observational multimessenger (electromagnetic, gravitational wave, neutrino, nucleosynthetic) signatures in preparation and support of upcoming space missions such as the NASA James Webb Space Telescope, the NASA Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and the ESA Euclid mission. SMS collapse is a promising pathway to SMBH formation, yet its simulation with the necessary microphysics (stellar equation of state, nuclear reactions) and approximate or full general relativity has thus far been limited to spherical or axial symmetry, completely ignoring magnetic fields and 3D dynamics. Lightcurve and spectral modeling has only been performed for a single SMS explosion model. Moran's research program will comprehensively address SMS evolution through collapse and potential explosion in 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with detailed microphysics, producing observables across the SMS parameter space spanned by mass, metallicity, rotation, and magnetization. Necessary code development in support of the program will be released as open source. The broader impact of the program includes the Summer Space Programming Challenge, in which students and teachers will gain further interest in space research, concrete computational skills, a project portfolio, and open source curriculum materials."
0.49,"Non-technical abstract<br/>Living matter can change its structure as it responds to changes in its environment. With support from the Solid-State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the goal of this research is to replicate this type of responsiveness using artificial materials that can reconfigure themselves in response to an external stimulus, in this case light. Reconfigurable matter consists of a structure composed of smaller elements whose properties can be switched by light. After switching, these elements can reassemble into a new composite structure that has different properties. Many workers in the field envision the switchable elements to be nanoparticles or colloids, but it is clear that the smallest switchable element is a molecule. A molecule that undergoes a photochemical reaction represents a switchable element. A crystal composed of photoreactive molecules can then restructure itself after exposure to light. This proposal is concerned with the development of molecular crystal materials that can undergo photoinduced shape changes as a route to reconfigurable matter. Materials that undergo structural changes in response to light have potential applications a wide range of disciplines ranging from engineering to medicine to cell biology. Participating students will receive advanced training in spectroscopy, materials characterization, and data analysis. Outreach efforts supported by this grant will improve science education at Taft Elementary, a Title I (>70% socioeconomically disadvantaged) school that is also >70% underrepresented minority. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>This research program has three main goals. First, new materials and approaches to molecular crystal-based photoinduced motion will be developed. This motion usually originates from the presence of a mixture of reactant and product molecules within the crystal that form a bimorph structure. New halogenated anthracene derivatives will be synthesized to improve the robustness and reversibility of the [4+4] photodimerization reaction that powers the crystal mechanical response. New types of photochemical reactions based on the unimolecular cis-trans isomerization of divinyl(anthracene) derivatives will also be explored. The materials development will include efforts to develop novel micron-scale crystal morphologies that can give rise to new modes of mechanical response. A second area of focus will be to improve the physical understanding of the photomechanical response by studying its mechanism and limits. By measuring how light intensity, direction, wavelength, and crystal shape affect the rate and magnitude of crystal bending, different theories proposed to explain the mechanical response can be evaluated. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments will measure spin diffusion dynamics to assess whether the reactions proceed homogeneously throughout the crystal or heterogeneously with domain formation. These experiments will provide information on both the size and shape of nanoscale domains that grow during the photochemical reaction. Third, we will prepare arrays of nanocrystals that can reshape themselves after exposure to light. Surface patterning followed by microdrop printing will generate separated nanocrystals composed of photoreactive molecules. These crystal arrays will be characterized by optical spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy. Photoinduced shape changes will be measured and correlated with starting crystal shape and size, as well as light exposure."

This research will benefit science and society by developing identification keys which will allow the public, especially members of native plant organizations, to identify and therefore have a deeper appreciation for the biological diversity of phlox. These data will also allow conservationists to make informed, cost-effective decisions as they seek to preserve endangered and threatened species at both the State and Federal level, especially in California, Nevada, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.<br/><br/>Polemonium has been the subject of multiple molecular phylogenetic studies yet the relationships among its species remain undetermined.

This study will be the first to sample all species and utilize multiple nuclear loci to determine species relationships. These data will test the hypothesis that floral form has been selected for by pollinators and the morphometric data will determine the evolution of leaf form. Collection data from natural history museums will be used to investigate the biogeographic history of Polemonium. The use of comparative phylogenetic methods with these data sets provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct the ancestral character states at various time periods during phlox evolution.

The importance of model-based approaches to correctness and robustness of distributed CPS designs is well recognized by industry, and several efforts are underway in academia and industry. The project will make additional contributions by identifying and filling some of the gaps/limits of the current state-of-art. The translation from heterogeneous behavioral models of distributed CPS components to common unified automata based models shall find its use in other formal reasoning (e.g., monitoring, model-checking, synthesis, security analysis).

For system-wide testing and validation, a system-level modeling language (AADL or SysML) can formally capture the end-to-end CPS architecture, component behaviors, requirements, and failure-modes. Also, modeling and analysis tools, including code-generators and model-checkers, exist. Our contribution will be to provide new additions on unified system-level modeling, testing and verification for distributed CPS, supporting new features: (i) Novel approaches for CPS components modeling capturing implementation imperfections, process randomness, timing and concurrency features; (ii) Approach to interface and adjoin component models to obtain an overall model for system-level analysis; (iii) Model-based system-level testing approach for stochastic dynamical systems introducing probabilistic guarantees of coverage, and error-localization; (iv) Quantifier elimination based compositional property verification; (v) Scalable approaches to reachability analysis in hybrid systems. Specifically, these would be enabled through (i) A modeling approach for software under hardware constraints of computing precision and delays to enable an early and cost-efficient processor-in-the-loop testing/verification; (ii) For system-level testing/verification, a unified components-based concurrent system modeling in form of communicating Input-Output Stochastic Hybrid Automata, capable of capturing timing issues (delays, drifts, multi-rate processing), randomness of physical components, and concurrency; (iii) Model-based probabilistic approach for system-level testing, validation and error localization, accounting for uncertainties.

0.5,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports mesoscale modeling of solid-state interfaces in metals, with a view to predicting interface structure and interface interactions with crystals defects: point defects, dislocations, and cracks. This effort will lead to quantitative structure-property relations for interfaces, which may then be used to design structural composite materials with interfaces tailored to yield desired functionalities, such as high strength or fracture toughness, radiation or wear resistance, reduced corrosion or creep, and others. Such materials would have a major impact on energy applications.<br/><br/>The PI will pursue three specific scientific objectives. The first is to create mesoscale models that quantitatively describe and predict detailed interface structure. The second is to discover the mechanisms of interface-defect interactions, and create quantitative mesoscale models of these mechanisms. Finally, the third objective is to validate structure and defect interaction predictions through numerical uncertainty quantification and hypothesis-driven experiments. Initially, this project will be restricted to a subset of all possible interfaces, namely semicoherent interfaces formed between immiscible single-element metals. The structure of such interfaces may be described using misfit dislocations, which eases development of quantitative structure models and provides a basis for predicting interface-defect interactions. Heterophase interfaces between immiscible metals generally remain stable under a variety of conditions and do not migrate or intermix easily, easing experimental investigation.<br/><br/>Work will focus on flat interfaces in their lowest energy state, but with differing crystallographic characters. Only pairs of metals whose crystal structures may be related to the face-centered-cubic structure by uniform deformations will be studied. Both heterophase interface and grain boundaries fall within this subset. The effect of temperature will be studied, but investigations of the effects of curvature, faceting, large pre-existing extrinsic defect concentrations, or non-equilibrium state will be postponed. This project will consider interface interactions with three types of defects: point defects, dislocations, and cracks. The interactions to be studied are defect trapping, emission, transmission, and motion near and within interfaces. Interactions with other types of defects - such as voids, inclusions, point defect clusters, or other interfaces - will not be studied as part of this project. There are no fundamental physical limitations that prevent broadening the scope of future work to interfaces, interactions, and defect types other than those listed above.<br/><br/>The education component of this project will support the development of a new class on defect physics and the revision of an exiting class on mechanical behavior of materials. All materials as well as videotaped lectures for both classes will be made available worldwide through MIT's OpenCourseWare. This project will enhance the training of future scientists by providing undergraduate research opportunities in materials modeling and integrating their work with international collaborations through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives program. Postdoctoral experience is increasingly critical for scientists to gain proficiency in leading research projects that span across and integrate both modeling and experimental results from different fields of study. The PI will establish a postdoc office that will undertake to enhance the postdoc experience at MIT.<br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to increase our understanding of interfaces in metals through theory and computer modeling. Interfaces are locations where two different crystals meet and are ubiquitous in engineering alloys such as steel, aluminum, titanium, and many others. Although interfaces typically comprise less than 0.01% of the volume of such materials, they play a decisive role in determining their mechanical, electrical, thermal, and diffusion properties. Textbooks often portray them schematically as two-dimensional and abrupt. This simplification is convenient and often necessary, but fundamentally false: interface structure is inherently three dimensional, often complex, and occasionally quite beautiful. Thus, much remains to be understood about the structure and properties of interfaces.<br/><br/>An improved understanding of interfaces may provide a path to making better engineering alloys. The performance envelope of materials limits much of what technology can accomplish, for example in energy applications: from steam generators and batteries to high-voltage power lines and nuclear reactors, better materials translate into cleaner, safer, and cheaper energy. Materials performance in these applications is often controlled by crystal defects, such as vacancies, dislocations, and cracks. Tailoring the interactions of interfaces with such defects is one path to expanding the performance envelope of materials.<br/><br/>This project has three objectives. The first is to develop models that capture the full complexity of interface structure with enough precision to make quantitative predictions. The second is to discover how interfaces with different structures interact with defects that control materials performance and to develop the capability to predict these interface-defect interactions from interface structure. Finally, the third objective is to validate the interface structure and defect interaction models described above. All models make simplifying assumptions. A major goal of this work is to develop strategies for validating models of interface structure and defects interactions using both theory and experiments.<br/><br/>Because there is an infinite number of possible interfaces, this project has to focus on a selected subset of them. The specific types of interfaces to be studied have therefore been downselected based on criteria that give the highest likelihood of making rapid progress towards achieving the goals of this project. Similarly, interactions of interfaces with only three types of defects will be considered: point defects, dislocations, and cracks. There are, however, no fundamental physical limitations that prevent broadening the scope of future work to interfaces, interactions, and defect types other than those initially downselected.<br/><br/>The defect and interface physics involved in this project will be used to support the development of a new class and the revision of an existing class on mechanical behavior of materials at MIT. Thanks to MIT's commitment to share its educational resources through online programs such as OpenCourseWare, these classes will benefit a worldwide audience. This project will enhance the training of future scientists by providing undergraduate research opportunities both at MIT and internationally through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives program. Finally, this project will enhance the experience of scientists at MIT who recently received their PhDs and intend to continue building a career in research."
0.36,"BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:<br/><br/>Research in Optics (RiO) is a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program at the College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science Foundation. Optics involves the study of light and the year 2015 has been recognized as the International Year of Light. The goal for the three years of support is to educate and conduct research with ten undergraduates per year in the field of optics. The field is a burgeoning area of industry and consumer product development, academic research, and energy generation. In the commercial sector, optical products are integral to everyday lives through smartphone displays, LEDs for lighting, and imaging systems used in the medical field. In the energy sector, optical concentrators are being used in solar power facilities to improve the efficiency of electricity generation. In the academic sector, researchers and students are developing novel technologies, exploring the fundamental limits of the world, and developing the telescopes imaging distant stars and their planets. These topics and others are the areas of research for the undergraduates selected for the RiO program. <br/><br/>The objective of RiO is to develop an interest in optics within the student participants and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in a STEM field. A metric of 50% female and 60% minority representation has been set for this program. The participants additionally will have workshops in introductory optics, ethics training, presentation skills, and lab and laser safety and at the end of each summer will hone their presentation skills through both oral and poster events. Thus, RiO will educate future researchers and engineers in this recognized and important field for the United States in the 21st century. The participants will serve as role models for future generations by encouraging others to pursue STEM research, especially in optics.<br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>RiO participants will engage in experimental, theoretical, and modeling research over the breadth of the optics field, including optical engineering, imaging systems, photonics, and optical physics. A project on bio-inspired optical design based on models of animal eyes has the potential to improve upon the designs of lens systems currently in use. Research on a better understanding of the optical properties of semiconductors can lead to a multitude of benefits including improved lasers and future optical technologies. Research on improved internal building illumination using daylighting means less dependency on fossil fuel electricity generation. Development of a platform independent toolbox for quantum control and measurement can lead to improved quantum information security and cryptography along with error correction. A project in the optical detection and classification of special nuclear material can determine if the matter is benign or threatening. Specific research will develop endoscopes with both forward and backward optics that can see tumors that are hidden from view for solely front-viewing systems. Research on the effect of mid-spatial frequency optical surface error will allow control of such during the manufacture of multi-meter telescope mirrors, such as the Giant Magellan Telescope. <br/><br/>These and other projects will expand our knowledge in and use of optics to solve challenges and develop new technology. The student participants will also have workshops in introductory optics, ethics training, presentation and writing skills, and lab and laser safety. Thus, the student participants will not only be conducting research at the forefront of optics, but they will be trained to succeed as researchers if they pursue graduate studies or enter the workforce after graduation."
0.297,"This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project investigates effective sensing methodologies to assess the integrity of the interface between steel bars and concrete in reinforce concrete (RC) structures. The approach consists in the application of active acoustic interrogation with optical fibers-based sensing. The combination of the two modalities will allow sensing a multiple locations, which will significantly improve the ability to detect defects and structural degradations. The results of the research will benefit structural health monitoring and nondestructive testing of many structures components. One representative example is the detection of early-stage steel rebar corrosion in concrete structures. NACE (National Association of Corrosion Engineers) estimates the cost of corrosion damage repair in concrete structures in the USA is approximately $125 billion per year. Corrosion of steel rebars in RC structures is primarily responsible for the deterioration and immature failure of RC structures. Sensing capability to detect early-stage rebar corrosion can greatly reduce the cost for rebuild/repair, routine maintenance efforts, and the unnecessary social costs (e.g., traffic closure) in construction. More importantly, unpredictable structural failures can be prevented, especially for signature buildings and bridges. This research will not only change the current practice for monitoring steel rebar corrosion in RC structures, but also wil be applied to the corrosion monitoring of prestressed concrete structures, steel pipelines, nuclear power plants, and other critical civil infrastructure systems using steel. Educational efforts will motivate K-12 and undergraduate students for research, especially those from the underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The specific research goal is to study the sensing mechanism at the interface between steel reinforcing bars (rebars) and concrete in reinforced concrete (RC) structures using distributed active acoustic sensing. This will be achieved by i) investigating the active single-point probing/ sensing problem in a circular geometry; and ii) creating a distributed active acoustic optical fiber sensor. The sensor will be attached to the surface of steel rebars burned inside concrete, capable of probing into the steel rebars and assessing structural health of the interface between steel and concrete."
0.25,"Non-technical Abstract:<br/>In this project funded by the Solid-State Materials Chemistry program of the Division of Materials Research, the research team is developing crystalline porous materials that are activated by UV light. The photo-active chemical groups change shape when exposed to light. These light-driven transformations cause the pores (holes) and channels of the crystalline frameworks to change shape leading to materials capable of selectively absorbing or releasing guest molecules, for example pharmaceutical drugs, but only when exposed to the proper wavelength of light. In addition to advancing our understanding of the fundamental photochemistry that occurs in these novel materials, the research establishes design principles to understand and ultimately control and prevent fatigue (failure) in a variety of photo-responsive materials. The education and outreach activities bring crystallography and X-ray science into U.S. classrooms through the continued development of an X-ray science course for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. The educational projects, including a nation-wide crystal growing competition, bring concepts of crystals and light to K-12 classrooms through the development of hands-on experiments and curricular development for teachers and students.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This research focuses on identifying and understanding the root causes of fatigue in photochromic materials with the ultimate goal of developing design principles to control fatigue in any photo-responsive system. The primary objective is developing a detailed molecular level understanding of the photochemistry occurring within diarylethene-based materials, an exciting niche in the nascent field of photo-responsive metal-organic frameworks. Specific aims of the research include: (1) the synthesis and characterization of new diarylethene-based photoswitchable linkers and metal-organic frameworks prepared from these linkers, (2) quantifying the photophysics of photochromic molecules in crystalline environments using spectroscopic and diffraction methods to determine reaction energetics and limitations, (3) determining the factors and triggers that govern fatigue in these materials, (4) developing new techniques to assess the distribution of guest species within the metal-organic framework nanopores and determining their impact on the photophysical properties of the crystalline frameworks, (5) using the knowledge gained to rationally design and engineer advanced photochromic materials with enhanced properties, namely improved resistance to fatigue. The primary research tools include traditional and in situ single crystal X-ray diffraction (photo-crystallography), steady-state and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy/microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and computational modeling."
0.290924,"Jones / Hayes<br/>1403239 / 1403298 <br/>Collaborative Research: Characterizing Interactions of Carbon Dioxide with Tailored Adsorbing Materials for Capture of Carbon Dioxide from Power Plant Exhaust Gas and Ambient Air<br/><br/>Capturing CO2 from ambient air, or air capture, has significant technical challenges. The concentration of CO2 in air (~ 400 ppm) is far less than the CO2 concentrations in other applications such as post-combustion flue gas treatment. Any air capture process must use minimal amounts of energy, ideally from a distributed renewable source such as solar thermal energy. To apply air capture or conventional Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) on large scales, low cost and highly durable materials are required. <br/><br/>Tailored carbon dioxide adsorbents that combine nitrogen-bearing chemicals on solid sponge-like supports are perhaps the only class of adsorbents that might be practical for air capture applications. These materials are also important in CO2 removal from flue gases. These gas separation processes require a material to selectively removes CO2 (leaving other species behind) in the temperature range of 0-65 C, and in an environment where water is ubiquitous. Under these conditions, many types of adsorbents can be effectively ruled out. Some (physisorbents) will not effectively adsorb CO2 under these conditions because water competes with the carbon dioxide for sites within the material. Some other chemical types (chemisorbents) require high temperature operating conditions. <br/><br/>In contrast,the PIs propose to use supported amines to adsorb large volumes of CO2. The amines are also selective for CO2. Even when the carbon dioxide is fairly dilute, as in air, these materials are able to withdraw the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Thus, the proposed work here focuses on fundamental characterization of connections between CO2 and the specialized adsorbents, targeted towards conventional CCUS. <br/><br/>The purpose of the proposed work is to provide a comprehensive study of specialized solid amine adsorbents in cycles of carbon dioxide adsorption and desorption relevant to CO2 capture from industrial emissions like power plant flue gas and ambient air. The work will bring together traditional adsorption/desorption studies with structural characterization techniques applied to these materials, coupled with computational studies. A particularly innovative aspect will be the application of three different in-situ spectroscopic techniques, infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the structure of the CO2 as it adsorbs to the surface of the specialized amine adsorbent. <br/><br/>A cost-effective technology that could capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air could minimize the problems associated with transporting large volumes of CO2 from point source emitters (e.g. coal-fired power plants) to sites suitable for geological sequestration. Unlike conventional Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) from large power plant exhaust gases, which can at best slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, direct air capture, if widely adopted, can reduce the atmospheric CO2 level. This technology can impact distributed emissions sources (e.g. vehicles) that are currently beyond the reach of carbon capture technologies. The fundamental scientific investigations will provide new insights that will impact a wide array of CO2 adsorption technologies, including post-combustion CO2 capture, the direct extraction of CO2 from ambient air, purification of natural gas streams, and adsorption of CO2 on similar nitrogen-bearing materials for catalysis. <br/><br/>The collaborative project engages scientists from two disciplines, (i) chemical and biomolecular engineering and (ii) chemistry and biochemistry, with student exchanges and collaboration fostering communication across the boundaries of science and engineering. <br/><br/>The project also has significant potential to impact groups that are historically under-represented in science and engineering. PIs will actively recruit under-represented students to take part in this research, engaging Georgia Tech programs such as the Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program. Additionally, the Institute for School Partnership (ISP) at Washington University will engage secondary school teachers and teach them about CCUS."
0.62,"This project, submitted in response to the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) announcement, is jointly funded by the Condensed Matter Physics and Ceramic Programs in the Division of Materials Research.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project has a number of objectives. The first objective is to involve up to 40 undergraduate students in publishable research in glass science over the duration of the project. New oxide glasses are being prepared using novel techniques such as fast cooling, laser heating and new chemical pathways. As well, they are examining the intermediate range order of glass on the level of a handful of atoms. Finally they are producing glasses that have new technical applications. For example, one family of glasses is being developed to detect neutrons for medical and national security purposes. The project has broad impact by training undergraduate students in many aspects of glass research, ~75% will continue to graduate school; running workshops to inform colleagues how to conduct high level research at small colleges, and inviting high school students to join this work and working with pre-college students of all grades in eastern Iowa on science programs at Coe College and in local schools.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: It is likely that the most transformational part of this work concerns the determination of the intermediate range order of oxide glasses of up to ten atoms or so. This outstanding scientific problem concerns such phenomena as ionic conduction, the mixed-alkali effect, and viscosity and relaxation effects. The experimental means for this study include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with a focus on boron using both of its isotopes separately as well as isotopic dilutions and boron Double Angle Rotation NMR, neutron scattering, dual atomic force microscopy/Raman spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Physical property determinations complement these measurements. Simultaneous to this work is the development of novel glasses using rapid cooling, laser levitation, and alternative chemical means. One application for this is the development of semiconducting lithium borovanadate glasses for neutron detection. Broader impacts include the thorough training of up to 40 undergraduate students in research, including their daily use of many state-of-the art instruments, the involvement of high school students and their teachers in research, outreach to younger students, and leadership service within the glass science field. A new and important component of this project is the mentoring and hosting of workshops for colleagues at other colleges interested in doing high-level research with their students."
0.305807,"Research has shown that in some societies fathers have lower testosterone levels than non-fathers. Recent research by the investigators conducting this project was the first to use data collected over multiple years to show that it is the transition to married life and first-time fatherhood which causes large declines in testosterone, compared to if men remain single and childless. These decreases in testosterone in new fathers and married men have been hypothesized to improve men's functioning as parents and spouses, but this has yet to be thoroughly tested, and it is known that not all men who become married or have children experience substantial decreases in testosterone. This variation across men in their hormonal responses might be linked to differences in mens roles across professional, social, and familial (including nuclear and extended kin) lives. To clarify the behavioral effects of these hormonal changes, their variation across men, and how these hormonal aspects impact child well-being and relationship quality requires that men and their families be followed through time. This project will explore these questions among 908 men, their spouses, and children participating in a unique study in the Philippines that has followed a large sample of families for 30 years. Demographic, health, behavioral, and relationship data will be collected through interviews with men and their spouses. Parents will provide child well-being and development data, and men's testosterone will be measured in saliva samples. <br/><br/> By correlating hormone levels with detailed reports of men's familial, professional, and social behaviors and comparing with outcomes related to child well-being and family relationships, this study will help clarify the importance of men's biology to the functioning of families. This project also expands understanding of the ways in which behavior and biology differ between individuals and across cultural groups by contributing important insights into the range of human diversity in fathering/marital behaviors and their relationships to male hormonal profiles. In achieving these goals, the project will be central to an integrative graduate/undergraduate training program in human biology at Northwestern University, and will broadly and positively impact productive international scientific collaboration between scholars and universities in the United States and the Philippines."
0.146851,"The foundation of comparative biology rests on the investigation of organismal similarities and differences that are generated through evolutionary processes. One important application of the comparative method in the study of biodiversity is the comparison of sister lineages, groups which are each other's closest relative, that have undergone very different evolutionary histories. By comparing the fates of these lineages, scientists are able to understand why some are successful and others are not. A prominent example is the sunflower family, the Asteraceae, and its less well-known sister family, the Calyceraceae. The Asteraceae has been one of the most successful plant families with over 20,000 species spread throughout the world, including many economically important plants, such as sunflowers, daises, lettuce, artichokes and dandelions. The evolution of the Calyceraceae on the other hand has resulted in only 56 species, all found in southern South America. Despite the large number of species, Asteraceae researchers are developing an understanding of the family?s evolutionary trajectory and traits, however little is known about the Calyceraceae. This research project will develop an understanding of what the common ancestor of these two families was like. This will allow a careful analysis of which changes allowed the Asteraceae to succeed in generating great diversity, including developing economically important traits, and which inhibited Calyceraceae diversification. This project will foster interactions among scientists, graduate, and undergraduate students in two countries, thus enhancing international collaboration and cultural awareness. <br/><br/>Field work will be undertaken in collaboration with researchers in Argentina to collect the 56 species of the Calyceraceae. This material will be used to generate a molecular phylogeny and a morphological trait matrix. Comparative DNA sequencing of both chloroplast and nuclear genes will be undertaken to infer phylogenetic relationships in the family. Additionally a morphological trait matrix, of important flower and fruit characteristics, will be generated and analyzed in conjunction with the phylogeny to study the evolution of character states in the Calyceraceae. This data on the Calyceraceae will complement the knowledge already available for the Asteraceae allowing for addressing powerful comparative biology questions. What are the phylogenetic relationships among all species of Calyceraceae? What are the ancestral floral and fruit character traits states in Calyceraceae and how do these relate to those in the Asteraceae? The final products of the research include bilingual taxonomic revision, including dichotomous and polyclave keys, which will be made available in both print and electronic versions. To increase participation by underrepresented groups, students will be recruited via Brigham Young University's Multicultural Student Center. Guest presentations and lab exercises covering state-core competencies will be developed with two area high school instructors. A rotating display will also be developed, using age-appropriate materials, for the BYU Life Science Museum, which is heavily visited by K-12 students."

One emphasis is on designing wireless sensor networks. which are an emerging technology with the potential to detect chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons in transport. Another application is to distributed processing where data systems are too large for central processing. This overload of data now appears in engineering, physics, astronomy, medicine, biology, and industrial applications that demand real-time processing on as ever-increasing amounts of data. Frames also have application to a number of important problems in pure mathematics."
0.429387,"The neutron monitor at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott Station, located at the geographic South Pole, has operated since 1964.

South Pole is a unique location at high altitude and low geomagnetic cutoff rigidity. This installation is the lynchpin of the worldwide neutron monitor network at low energies and the primary link to spacecraft measurements at much lower energies.

0.42,"This effort is based on collaboration between research groups at the University of Minnesota (UMN) and the Albert-Ludwigs-Universitaet (ALU) in Freiburg, Germany. The research focuses on a novel crystal growth technique, the Detached Bridgman process, that originated in early microgravity experiments conducted during the first Skylab missions (1974). By eliminating deleterious interactions between the growing crystal and the ampoule wall, this method is capable of producing crystals with unprecedented levels of structural perfection; however, detached solidification has not yet been reliably implemented on earth. The combined experimental work at ALU and theoretical research at UMN will aim to make this process viable under terrestrial growth conditions. An important part of this joint project focuses on student exchanges that will train graduate students in both crystal growth theory and practice and will provide them with international experiences that will encourage them to become leaders in the global materials research community of tomorrow.<br/><br/><br/>This activity teams two of the foremost crystal growth groups in the world to leverage their strongly complementary skills toward the realization and transformative potential of detached solidification. Experiments and theory will be conducted with complementary goals; the effort at UMN brings crystal growth modeling tools and expertise with significant computational resources available from the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, and the ALU experimental effort leverages their mastery and state-of-the-art infrastructure for crystal growth, along with 10 years of experience with detached growth on earth and in space. Enabling the detached Bridgman process promises a means to produce large, single crystals of compound semiconductors with quality heretofore unattainable. Initial efforts will focus on growing the II-VI semiconductor cadmium zinc telluride, a material needed for high-sensitivity radiation detectors that are of great strategic importance for nuclear nonproliferation applications and securing national borders."
0.862769,"In order to understand the physical relationship between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, it is essential to determine the mass of the black hole itself. Unfortunately we are limited to directly measuring black hole masses in nearby galaxies. In order to fully understand the energetic impact of black holes at cosmological distances, we must instead use secondary indicators to estimate their masses. These so-called scaling relationships are fundamental to our knowledge of galaxies and black holes at high redshifts, but they remain poorly determined. The PI will perform a multiwavelength observational program that is targeted at removing many known sources of uncertainty and scatter among a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei with direct black hole mass measurements. The PI will (1) carry out a new reverberation mapping survey to measure black hole masses in 20 galaxies; (2) use integral field unit observations of the nuclear region to measure stellar dynamics; and (3) derive distances to the host galaxies using 21 cm spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This program will solidify the scaling relationships that are heavily used by the community for estimating black hole masses at cosmological distances and will pave the way for a significant leap forward in our understanding of galaxies and black holes throughout cosmic history.

0.016549,"The Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) was a major biogeographic event that connected the terrestrial animal communities of North and South America via the closure of the Panamanian Isthmus. Geological evidence and the fossil record have suggested that the closure of the isthmus occurred 3 million years ago (mya), but more recent studies suggest a much older age for the formation of a landbridge between North and South America, around 15 mya. Among mammals of North American origin, the raccoon family (Procyonidae), which also includes coatis, kinkajous, olingos, and ringtails, has one of the longest histories in South America. The fossil record shows that an extinct member of this group was the first North American mammal to immigrate to South America, approximately 7-9 mya. While the prevailing hypothesis states that immigration of modern members of this group took place 3 mya, recent estimates based on DNA sequence data revealed that this family has had a much longer tenure in South America. This study will more thoroughly test competing hypotheses regarding the process and timing of evolution of this group, with the potential to revise our understanding of mammal evolution in the Neotropics, while contributing to advancement in the fields of genomics, systematics, taxonomy, and biogeography, as well as promoting the professional development of an early-career female STEM researcher. <br/><br/>This project will use an integrative approach to test competing hypotheses based on genomic analyses of museum specimens, morphometrics, and biogeographic modeling. Ancient DNA techniques in combination with high-throughput sequencing methods will be used to sequence mitochondrial genomes as well as to sample the nuclear genome using a novel intron-capture microarray. Morphometric data will be analyzed separately and in conjunction with comparative genomic data to test hypotheses regarding procyonid evolution and revise the taxonomy of this group. A new biogeographic model for the evolution of the raccoon family that accommodates the most recent DNA and geological evidence will be tested against the traditional fossil-based hypothesis, and will integrate phylogenetic data to reassess the tempo and geographic pattern of diversification associated with the GABI. Results will be shared through scientific publications co-authored by the PI, Co-PI, and collaborators. Genomic and morphological data, protocols, scripts and parameters used in the analyses will be made publicly available through the electronic repositories of NCBI?s Genbank and Dryad."
0.37,"Chloroplasts play a central role in plant metabolism and in supporting the growth and differentiation of plant cells. Although most chloroplast proteins are encoded in the nucleus, produced in the cytosol, and imported into the chloroplast, few are encoded by the chloroplast genome. Typically, interfering with chloroplast gene function causes defects in photosynthesis, but in some species the effects of such disruptions are more severe and result in early lethality. For example, disrupting chloroplast translation in Arabidopsis often causes embryo lethality, but in other species results in seedlings that are albino, but viable. Recent work suggests that a single chloroplast gene (accD), encoding one subunit of a heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase required for fatty acid biosynthesis, may be responsible for the strikingly different consequences - lethality vs. viable albino - of blocking chloroplast translation in different plant species. This project will evaluate this model, explore its implications for plant biology, and provide valuable insights into basic cellular and metabolic processes that underlie plant development. Several different strategies will be pursued: (1) Determine whether embryo lethality in Arabidopsis mutants defective in chloroplast translation can be rescued by a nuclear transgene encoding a chloroplast-localized version of the normally cytosolic, homomeric carboxylase; (2) Compare the consequences of disrupting chloroplast translation in different accessions of Arabidopsis; and (3) Evaluate plant lineages where accD has been lost from the chloroplast genome. This work will help to illustrate how disrupting genes encoding the same metabolic function in different plant species can have divergent developmental impacts. Results will be published in scientific journals and biological materials distributed to Arabidopsis stock centers. A summer lab course based on this research will be developed to incorporate principles of plant genetics, biochemistry, and evolution, offering biology majors an alternative way to meet lab requirements by focusing on enhanced research, analytical, and writing skills."

The CSU students will improve the NLO Monte Carlo generators (NLOjet++, APPLGRID, etc.), perform jet cross-section related simulations and measurements with ATLAS data, extract the Parton Distribution Function (PDF), and understand systematic uncertainties in Top quark reconstruction. The measurements of spin and polarization properties of the Top quark are important tests of the Standard Model and are sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model. On ATLAS detector upgrades R&D, the CSU students will work on the installation and data analysis of small stand-along pixel detectors, and improving software packages in monitoring various inner detector components. On ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (DAQ), the CSU students will develop associative memory variables for Fast Tracker (FTK), improve and optimize FTK variable resolution patterns, and conduct offline and online testing of FTK resolution patterns performance. The students will also attend the renowned CERN Summer Student Lecture Series given by top physicists from all over the world. <br/><br/>The Higgs discovery by ATLAS and CMS experiments of LHC in 2012 has captured the attention and imagination of the public and students throughout the world. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will support 15 students over three years working on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This CSU international research project is focused on the largest university system in the country with 23 campuses and total population of approximately 430,000 students. Because CSU has very large minority and first-generation college student populations, student recruitment in this project will attract underrepresented students. Upon returning to the US, student participants will give colloquia, seminars, and invited talks at CSU campuses, high schools, and local communities about their ATLAS research work and the CERN summer experience."
0.285487,"In order to develop the next generation of clean and efficient vehicle engines and power-generating combustors, engineers need the next generation of computational modeling tools. Accurately describing the chemistry of conventional and alternative liquid transportation fuels is vital to predict harmful emission levels and other important quantities, but the high computational cost of detailed models for chemistry poses a significant barrier to use by designers. In order to use such accurate models, software is needed that can efficiently handle chemistry in practical simulations. This collaborative project aims to develop such tools, employing the computational power of modern parallelized central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). In addition to helping designers create clean and efficient engine technology, the advances made in this project are widely applicable to other computational modeling problems including astrophysics, nuclear reactions, atmospheric chemistry, biochemical networks, and even cardiac electrophysiology.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed effort is to develop software elements specifically targeted at co-processing on GPUs, CPUs, and other many-core accelerator devices to reduce the computational cost of using detailed chemistry and enable high-fidelity yet affordable reactive-flow simulations. This will be achieved by (1) developing and comparing chemical kinetics integration algorithms for parallel operation on CPUs and GPUs/accelerators, (2) developing a method for detecting local stiffness due to chemical kinetics and adaptively selecting the most efficient solver based on available hardware, (3) implementing a computational cell clustering strategy to group similar spatial locations, (4) demonstrating the improved performance offered by these software elements using commercial and open-source computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling reactive flows, and (5) designing a portable and sustainable software library based on the above software elements, including building a community of users. The result of this program will be an open source software library that significantly decreases the cost of using detailed, accurate chemistry in realistic combustion simulations; the success of the program will be determined based on achieving order-of-magnitude performance improvement or better."
0.365,"Assessment, design, and monitoring of human activities involving reservoirs and aquifers in the Earth's subsurface require large-scale computer simulation of flow and transport processes over long time periods. Such simulations are used to guide scientists and engineers regarding, e.g., petroleum production, groundwater management, and secure storage of wastes such as carbon dioxide and nuclear contaminants. Computer simulation of the subsurface environment is especially important because it is largely inaccessible to direct observation and therefore also difficult or impossible to rectify human failures. The project involves fundamental research and education on immiscible, two-phase subsurface flow. This project has the potential for significantly greater fidelity simulations by properly accounting for the nonlinearly coupled behavior of the physical processes embodied in the governing equations, and the numerical algorithms should work well on modern supercomputers. Moreover, many models of scientific and engineering interest consist of similar nonlinearly coupled flow and transport systems, and so general progress here is likely to support efforts more broadly. The project will fund the research of two STEM Ph.D. graduate students and involve at least two undergraduate students. They will work in the Center for Subsurface Modeling of the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, which provides an interdisciplinary environment mixing expertise in mathematics, computational science, petroleum engineering, and geological science. The students will be prepared for employment opportunities in academia, government laboratories, and industry. External collaborations will enhance the impact of the project.<br/><br/><br/>The project involves fundamental research on and development of new algorithms for nonlinear, coupled systems of partial differential equations with algebraic constraints. The target system to be addressed is immiscible, two-phase subsurface flow, which is used for numerical simulation of the movement of underground fluids. The project emphasizes the highly nonlinear physical processes of flow and transport, and how they influence each other. The objectives of the project are: (1) Improved numerical algorithms of mixed type for approximation of nonlinear flow within a multi-scale, heterogeneous porous medium when coupled to a transport model; (2) Development of Eulerian-Lagrangian Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory numerical algorithms for multi-dimensional, nonlinear transport when coupled to a nonlinear flow model; (3) Demonstration of the effectiveness of the algorithms in specific applications such as petroleum production, groundwater management, and carbon sequestration; and (4) Education and training of two graduate and two undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary setting. The project is expected to result in significantly better numerical approximations of subsurface flow and transport, even over very long time periods. Project success will be seen by the development of numerical algorithms that preserve mass locally, produce little to no overshoots or undershoots, exhibit low levels of numerical diffusion, and are of high order and accurate on coarse computational meshes. They will require a significantly relaxed CFL time-step restriction for stability. Most importantly, the methods will be shown to work well for the nonlinearly coupled system, in that the two systems will complement each other in terms of accuracy and efficiency."
0.3,"The objective of this project is to link the chemical composition and molecular structure of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) to the viscoelastic mechanical properties of the material. C-S-H is the main binding hydration product of portland cement that governs properties of concrete. If alumina is available during the production of C-S-H, typically from alumino-silicate supplementary cementitious materials, C-S-H is able to incorporate aluminum as a guest ion, producing a calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C-A-S-H). Alumina incorporation is seen to alter its molecular structure by increasing the tetrahedral chain length, a change that is seen to promote crosslinking between C-S-H layers. By applying a multiscale static and dynamic mechanical testing that include a novel nanomechanical characterization technique of dynamic nanoindentation, the main hypothesis that will be tested during this project is to determine whether C-A-S-H is less viscoelastic than C-S-H due to this increased polymerization. To relate chemical composition and molecular structure with viscoelastic properties, phase-pure C-S-H and C-A-S-H will be synthesized in the lab with varying composition and characterized using advanced techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for local atomic environment, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for detection of crystalline phases, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for bulk chemical composition. Furthermore, a combination of NMR characterization before and after mechanical testing will indicate if there are any changes in molecular structure during viscoelastic deformation, knowledge that will be transformative.<br/><br/>If the hypothesis that alumina substitution in C-S-H reduces creep is proved right, this research will lead to a new method of controlling the viscoelasticity of concrete that can ultimately lead to longer life of concrete structures. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world and production of it is associated with approximately 5% of the global CO2 emissions. Thus, any increase in the longevity of concrete structure will mean reduction in the amount of concrete produced and associated greenhouse gas emission. In addition, the main source of alumina in C-S-H is usually fly ash, a waste material that also reduces the portland cement content in concrete and thereby reduces its greenhouse gas emission. The research is well integrated with educational plans, including (a) training graduate student in advanced chemo-mechanical characterization of materials at multiscale, (b) incorporating research findings into graduate level classes, and (c) generating enthusiasm for engineering and sustainable construction among talented middle school students."
0.42,"Professor Ting Guo of the University of California at Davis is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to study X-ray Nanochemistry, which is defined as creating and discovering nanochemical processes to enhance the effects of X-rays. In this proposed work, chemically, lithographically, and microfluidically prepared nanoassemblies are synthesized and created to isolate, optimize and recombine individual enhancement mechanisms. Specifically, physical enhancement of localized energy deposition resulting from X-ray absorption by nanomaterials, chemical enhancement enabled by catalytic properties of nanomaterials, and the effective combination of the two are investigated in this work. The enhancement to the X-ray effects results in increase in the yield of many processes including X-ray triggered precision energy deposition in water, generation of a specific reactive oxygen species in water, bond formation reactions such as hydroxylation and polymerization, and bond cleavage reactions, e.g.,oxidation of nucleoabses leading to DNA strand breaks. Many of these processes can be used to probe the magnitude of enhancement. Three exemplary nanosystems are created to study (1) how to control charge transfer processes between reactive oxygen species and the nanostructures under X-ray irradiation, which is critical to the maximization of chemical enhancement, (2) how to measure and maximize physical enhancement through controlling the shape of nanostructures, and (3) how to combine the chemical and physical enhancement mechanisms without causing destructive interference between them, the latter sometimes occuring naturally. In ideal circumstances, up to 1,000 times combined enhancement to the yield of properly-designed hydroxylation and polymerization reactions is envisioned. Optical spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy are being used to assist this exploration.<br/><br/>X-ray nanochemistry is a new research topic in which X-ray-induced effects are magnified by introducing customized nanomaterials. Like any new field, many stiff challenges remain before the true potential of the field is known. The work supported by this MSN grant scrutinizes newly defined concepts such as different types of enhancement and explores new mechanisms to combine these to achieve unprecedented enhancements. The proposed research endeavors attempt to solidify and expand the knowledge basis of this new field. The outcomes of these fundamental investigations may have transformative impacts on several categories of technology, for example, cancer diagnosis and treatment, energy conversion from nuclear wastes to liquid fuels, radiation sensing and detection, and remediation of potential ecological effects of nanomaterials under constant irradiation of background ionizing radiation. Education of the first generation scientists including women and underrepresented minority graduate and undergraduate students working on the forefront of this new field is directed at creating a workforce that helps define the future of X-ray nanochemistry. The instrumentation and research platform developed and employed in this work are new and inexpensive, and can be adopted by the majority of research laboratories in the country."
7.74479,"The project team intends Americas Lightpaths (AmLight) to enable research and education amongst the people of the Americas through the operation of production infrastructure for communication and collaboration between the US and Western Hemisphere science and engineering research and education communities. Four links are proposed to tie together the major research networks of five of the larger countries in the Americas: Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and the United States. In addition, this work will enable interconnects between the United States and the Latin American regional network of RedCLARA, which enables connectivity to 18 Latin American national research and education networks.<br/><br/>The effort is fundamentally collaborative, includingg AURA, ANSP, RNP, CENIC, AtlanticWave, PacificWave, ANSP, CUDI, RedCLARA, and REUNA. Through AtlanticWave and PacificWave, there will be production connectivity and peering to North American backbone networks Internet2, National Lambda Rail (NLR), ESnet, and CANARIE. Through RedCLARA, there will be production connectivity to thirteen national research and education networks with plans to expand to eighteen NRENs during the life of the project. <br/><br/>AmLight will enhance global e-Science collaborations through distributed production peering fabrics, as well as any research and education networks present or future that connect to AtlanticWave or PacificWave. AmLight is a network architecture designed to support the needs of U.S.-Western Hemisphere research and education communities in a manner that supports the evolving nature of discovery and scholarship. The capacity and designs are based on collaborative funding over the five-year project plan, and are expected to evolve and continue to match the needs of the community. <br/><br/>Over 40 collaborations that include participants from the Americas are funded directly by NSF and encompass disciplines including physics, environmental science, oceanography, climate change, astronomy, and others. AmLight will serve as the foundational infrastructure to support these collaborations. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>AmLight is an approach to solve the problem of interconnecting not just the advanced networks, but the core communities and needs behind them in the Western Hemisphere. Today?s research is being adversely impacted by the lack of networking capacity to and from South America. AmLight provides the structure and the resources to empower researchers and educators. These successes present themselves qualitatively in the creation of geographically distributed research groups using the network, working groups formed through common interests developed on the network, and publications made possible through the network. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>As the network ties together more instruments and research groups at higher speeds, the result will be an increase in the rate of gathering, processing, and sharing data. This will produce an increase in the rate of discovery. The possible impact of this award touches on many areas of collaborative science and engineering. From biodiversity research that will identify specimens faster, to collaborative biomedical engineering that will discover drug treatments more quickly, to nuclear physicists. Scholarship in the Americas will improve through new opportunities for collaborative teaching, technology-augmented student mobility, and an infrastructure for inquiry-based learning. The AmLight project will allow U.S. classrooms to share a window to classrooms throughout the Western Hemisphere.<br/><br/>The NSF designates Hispanic Americans as a disadvantaged community. This infrastructure gives Hispanic Americans a new and unique advantage - the opportunity to leverage cultural and language commonalities with collaborators in Latin America to advance their pursuit of research and education in the US. This award will offer an advantage to not only the Hispanic populations throughout the US, but will cement collaborative relationships throughout the Americas."
0.255655,"PI Name: Brian Kirby<br/>Proposal Number: 1605574<br/><br/>Microscopic algae are a promising future platform for the sustainable production of biofuels. These organisms use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous dissolved in liquid medium to make lipids which can be processed into liquid transportation fuel. The growth of algae in outdoor open ponds, and the accumulation of lipids by the algae, can vary considerably during the day or week. This requires frequent monitoring of algal productivity for production planning. However, measurement of algal productivity is presently time consuming and costly, requiring manual sampling and sophisticated analytical instruments. The goal of this project is to develop a simple, real-time sensor for monitoring algal lipids in a cultivation environment that is constantly changing. The proposed work will develop a sensor platform that measures the electrical properties of single algal cells as they flow through a microscope capillary tube. The change in electrical properties is correlated to the amounts and types of lipid stored within the algal cell. The educational activities associated with the project feature a student-run technical conference designed to diversify and provide mentorship for students in the Mechanical Engineering graduate program at Cornell University. <br/><br/>In outdoor pond cultivation systems used for algal biofuel production, the growth and lipid accumulation in algal cells are sensitive to constantly changing liquid nutrient medium composition, temperature, and sunlight intensity. Co-cultures containing two or more species of algae that have disparate metabolisms and chromophores may add stability to the overall cultivation platform under these changing conditions. However, lipid production in algal cells is often triggered by nutrient starvation, which adds to the temporal complexity of the system. There is a need to monitor and summarize all of this biological complexity with simple measurements that describe the overall lipid productivity of the co-culture as well as lipid productivity of individual sub populations. The proposed research will develop a microfluidic dielectric impedance monitor for rapid lipid detection in single algal cells and characterize lipid storage in algal co-cultures to elucidate mixed-strain culture effects. The project has three objectives. The first objective is to characterize starvation-induced, dielectric-property shifts in Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Neochloris oleoabundans and relate these shifts to biomass density and sequestration of lipids and starches. The second objective is to validate the flow-impedance cytometry measurements of lipid and starch accumulation by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-performance liquid chromatography. The third objective is to characterize the role of algal diversity with single-cell and bulk characterization of lipids in mixed-species culture."
0.022139,"Core-collapse supernova explosions from massive stars and collisions of neutron star mergers are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe. In these explosions and collisions, the key chemical elements of live (oxygen, carbon, iron etc.) and all heavy elements, including the rare earths metals, are synthesized and expelled into the interstellar medium. The goal of this PRAC project is to simulate core-collapse supernovae and the remnants of neutron star collisions at unprecedented physical detail. The investigators will use high-resolution three-dimensional simulations that include general relativity, fluid dynamics, radiation transport of neutrinos, magnetic fields, and a sophisticated description of the properties of the ultra-high density matter present in the cores of supernovae and neutron star collision remnants. The simulations will yield a deeper understanding of the processes occurring as a star turns from collapse to explosion and will elucidate the role of magnetic fields in both core-collapse supernovae and in the evolution of collision remnants. This will, in turn, yield better predictions for signals (in gravitational waves, neutrinos, and electromagnetic waves, and synthesized elements) from these phenomena. Astronomical observations can then be used to test theoretical models and constrain present uncertainties in nuclear physics and astrophysics."
0.48,"Direct detection of cosmic gravitational waves, an upcoming ""disruptive innovation"" in the field of astrophysics, will revolutionize our understanding of the universe in novel and plausibly unexpected ways. The key instruments for the new discoveries in the United States are the detectors of the advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, aLIGO. The research program of the Columbia Experimental Gravity group supports upcoming gravitational wave discoveries by improving the quality of the aLIGO data-streams available for astrophysical science extraction. The group also pioneers data analysis involving multiple cosmic messengers and gravitational waves. Many cosmic objects with strong gravitational fields also possess the strongest magnetic fields, the densest (bulk) nuclear matter, and the highest neutrino fluxes in the universe. Mergers and emissions of these objects can guide us to new physics, and can tell us about elusive cosmic events. Combining information from different windows on the universe, including gravitational waves, will enable us to reconstruct cosmic mysteries of our times. Students from high school through graduate level will have the opportunity to participate in this research. The urban setting and existing outreach infrastructure of Columbia University will enable unique educational and outreach activities based on this research that target schools and the general public not only in the local community but also in the greater New York City metropolitan area.<br/><br/>One of the critical limitations to aLIGO's scientific reach will be the artifacts embedded in the data due to disturbances in the detector's physical environment. The identification of environmental noise sources, the mitigation of their effect in the interferometers as well as the verification of instrument timing is vital (i) for ensuring a discovery that is justifiable to the broader scientific community, and (ii) for the realization of a spectrum of primary science goals for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. These all rely on achieving the design sensitivity for the advanced detectors and on achieving the lowest possible false event rates. In particular, the group will provide expertise in detector noise performance, physical environmental monitoring, and detector diagnostics studies. The anticipated ""dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy"" will enable detailed analysis of the science reach of gravitational-wave searches. Building on past experience the Columbia Experimental Gravity group's scientific focus will be on the foundations, implications and science extraction from joint searches that may involve neutrinos, electromagnetic and other counterparts to gravitational-waves from cosmic explosions, mergers, and other sources."
0.45111,"Spectroscopic sensing techniques are powerful analytical tools for detecting and identifying chemical and biological substances, and so are widely used in determining molecular structures, stand-off detection of explosives, imaging of air composition to name a few. However, the objects being imaged in the real-world are more often mixtures than pure substances, making difficult direct identification and quantification of chemical constituents from existing lookup tables or templates. A fundamental scientific problem is to unmix or decompose the measured spectral data into a non-redundant and compact combination of basic components (pure or source spectra) facilitating subsequent verification and quantification based on look-up tables. The principal investigator (PI) and his team study three classes of unmixing problems depending on the available knowledge of the source signals (minimal, partial or full knowledge of a template of source signals). The research problems are blind, partially blind and template assisted source separation and identification. The intellectual merit of the proposed project is a combined geometrical and statistical approach with associated computational algorithms incorporating sparsity regularized optimization techniques. The geometric approach is based on the sparseness of the spectra of the source signals while the statistical approach is on decomposing the errors of template based data fitting when partial and statistical knowledge of the source spectra is available. The proposed methods are shown to be applicable to laboratory data from nuclear magnetic rensonance, Raman spectroscopy and differential optical absorption spectroscopy.<br/><br/>The data analysis and computational algorithms on unmixing spectroscopic mixtures by the PI and his team can greatly improve the capability of threat reduction and decision making for public health and security. Their proposed line of work is well-positioned to generate broad impact on information technology, biotechnology, safety of civil infrastruture and environment; in particular the structural understanding and threat assessment of mixtures of chemical compounds originating in battle fields, homeland security, air quality monitoring, metabolic fingerprinting and disease diagnosis. The mathematical tools and numerical data produced in their project also benefit researchers and graduate students in data sharing and management, curriculum development and course offerings.

0.993443,"Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation. Although a great deal of theoretical and applied biology rests on understanding the rate at which it occurs and its effects, few estimates exist and the variation among individuals, populations, and species is largely unknown. This project will quantify mutation rates and their effects on a genome-wide scale using Daphnia, a group of animals that has long served as a sentinel for population biology, community ecology, and environmental toxicology. The detailed analysis will include estimating mutation rates at multiple scales, including i) among the major categories of mutation which differ in their mechanistic causes, ii) between genomes (mitochondrial and nuclear), and iii) within and between species exhibiting different characteristics. It will be partnered with an analysis of measurable (phenotypic) effects of mutations on traits such as longevity, growth rate, and fecundity among these same groups and in variable environments.

The benefits of this research include 1) deepening our understanding of key parameters in biology, 2) generating shared biological, genomic, and bioinformatic resources, 3) building science capacity through collaborating with the next generation of American and international scientists, and 4) educating the public about the central role of genetics, genomics, and evolution by sharing new discoveries as they occur."
0.81745,"The nature of Dark matter is one of the most compelling mysteries in fundamental science today. While there is convincing evidence that Dark Matter pervades the Universe, it has not been detected directly and its nature remains unknown. One possibility is that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a highly sensitive two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon experiment designed to detect WIMPs. At a WIMP mass of 100 GeV, LUX will be the most sensitive operating experiment. This award will support the group at Yale University. This group is responsible for several crucial subsystems, including the xenon purification and gas handling system, the 100 kilovolt cathode high voltage delivery system, the xenon recovery system, and radioactive sources and source manipulators for detector calibration. The Yale group has also developed a method of calibrating liquid xenon detectors using metastable krypton atoms dissolved in the liquid xenon, and has performed a new measurement of the scintillation efficiency and charge yield for nuclear recoils. The Yale group is highly engaged in LUX data processing and analysis. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Technology developments related to liquid xenon can be used in an increasing number of experiments worldwide that use noble liquids as detection materials.

The facilities include a high-performance network of more than 150 permanent stations providing data for global studies of earthquakes and deep Earth structure; a mobile array of more than 400 seismometers and atmospheric sensors completing a traverse of the conterminous United States and deploying to Alaska; and more than 4000 portable instruments (including magnetotelluric systems) are available for short-and long-term loan to university-based researchers for detailed studies as part of NSF-funded field programs. Future observing needs are being addressed via systematic engineering efforts. Data from all of these observational systems, along with extensive collections of seismic data contributed by other organizations, are freely and openly available through the IRIS Data Management Center.<br/><br/>Data collected and distributed through IRIS facilities form the observational basis for most of the fundamental studies in seismology carried out by researchers at US universities and in many organizations worldwide. The stability and high quality of the permanent observatories capture both the short-term details of faulting during the seconds to minutes of rupture in major earthquakes as well as decadal-scale changes in global earthquake activity. Data from permanent, mobile, and portable arrays are used to resolve features in Earth structure over scales that range from the whole Earth, to lithosphere, to regional basins, to fault zones. These data provide fundamental information on Earth structure and processes that, in combination with other geoscience disciplines, contribute to enhanced understanding of how the active Earth evolves and deforms. As a part of EarthScope, these observations contribute to multidisciplinary studies that focus on the structure and dynamics of North America and contribute to unraveling the history of deformation of the continent. <br/><br/>The IRIS program in Education and Public Outreach directly links the public and schools with the activities of an academic research community by demonstrating how basic seismological observations are made and used in Earth science investigations. Through a variety of activities that extend from the provision of classroom and web resources, to museum displays, public lectures, and internships, IRIS encourages students to engage in scientific inquiry and appreciate the importance of the Earth sciences in their lives. <br/><br/>In addition to supporting fundamental research, the seismological resources provided by IRIS serve dual use by contributing directly to societal needs through reporting of global earthquake activity and applications in monitoring nuclear test ban treaties.

0.326976,"Apatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH,F,Cl)2, is the tenth most abundant mineral on Earth and one with fundamental importance in geology, materials science, medicine, dentistry, pollutant mitigation, and as the foundation of the Earth's phosphorus cycle; indeed, all hard tissue of the human body except small parts of the inner ear are made of apatite. All of these applications of apatite require understanding of the atomic arrangement of the mineral. Despite the extensive multidisciplinary literature on apatite crystal chemistry, the atomic arrangements of members of the (OH,F,Cl) binary and ternary systems are not well understood and our current knowledge is full of inconsistencies that must be resolved; apatite is one of the rare minerals for which the atomic arrangement of the solid solutions cannot be predicted from the end-member arrangements.<br/><br/>Mixing of the end-member atomic arrangements suggests, for example, that binary members of the system must undergo symmetry breaking, possess immiscibility gaps, incorporate essential vacancies with an unknown method of charge balance, and/or possess anion positions that are not currently recognized. This multi-faceted proposed study will couple mineral synthesis and detailed compositional characterization with single-crystal X-ray structure analysis and Magic-Angle-Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopic studies in order to elucidate the nature of solid solution among and between the OH, F, Cl ternary apatites, and provide a better fundamental understanding of anionic substitution and phase behavior. The results of this study will have applications in the fields of geology, materials science, medicine, and dentistry. A proof-of-concept study demonstrates that miscibility along the F-Cl join is achieved by the creation of at least four anion sites in the F-Cl anion column, and confirms the efficacy of the proposed synthesis and analysis methods."
0.225,"The spectroscopic measurement of transition frequencies in simple atomic systems has significantly contributed to the progress of physics within the last 100 years. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom was developed on the basis of the quantum-classical correspondence of planetary orbits under the influence of the central electrostatic potential generated by the positively charged proton, with the additional ingredient of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. The theory has been refined over decades, with additional input from relativistic physics and quantum field theory. By analyzing the spectrum ever more carefully, one has been able to deduce from the experiments a few subtle properties of the atoms, such as the charge radius of the massive central particle, i.e., the proton. Recently, an experiment has been performed which questions the understanding of the field-theoretical modifications of the Coulomb force law at short distances: The so-called muonic hydrogen experiment at the Paul-Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, has been obtaining results for transitions in the bound system of muon and proton, which are in disagreement with other experiments and theoretical calculations performed by the physics community over at least two decades. Within the NSF program, some of the last conceivable explanations for the ensuing proton radius puzzle will be studied from the theoretical side, with the aim of either excluding these explanations, or finding confirmation for necessary modifications of our understanding of the nuclear charge distribution within the proton.<br/><br/>Based on the PI's somewhat broad knowledge in field theory, the concepts and ideas originally developed in the analysis of bound-state corrections will be applied to so-called dynamical processes and atom-surface interactions. When an atom is in contact with a dielectric surface, the vacuum modes of the electric field are perturbed in the immediate vicinity of the surface. The quantum fluctuations (the unavoidable 'quiver' due to the Heisenberg uncertainty relation) of the vacuum modes (the 'preferred natural oscillation modes' of the electric field in the vicinity of the metallic surface) change the interaction potential of the atom near the surface, and the 'dragging' of the mirror charge inside the dielectric material induces a friction force. This happens even if the atom is not in physical contact with the surface, and the overlap of the quantum mechanical wave function of the atom with the surface is negligible. These effects are due to be studied within the NSF research program, and compared to the results of ongoing experiments in various laboratories in the world. Finally, all of these effects will be studied for few-electron atoms, for which the energy eigenvalues of the basic quantum mechanical time evolution operator (the 'Hamiltonian' which defines the energy levels) cannot be calculated in analytic form. Ideas to improve approximation methods based on novel basis sets ('quantum mechanical trial wave functions') will be explored. <br/><br/>All of the research endeavors sketched above are suited for the education of graduate students. Indeed, both the gain in the knowledge on basic, but also applied physics as well the education in the use of advanced numerical methods contributes to the success of a number of graduate students supervised in the past (and, one may envisage, present and future). This includes the numerical methods used in the study of bound systems as well as other, more mathematically inclined concepts, based on the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields, which often find surprising, practically useful applications.<br/><br/>There are three major areas of work in this project. The first problem is the puzzle of the muonic hydrogen and proton radius. The muonic hydrogen puzzle continues to intrigue physicists and represents one of the most pressing questions to answer in regard to our understanding of fundamental forces. Namely, measurements in muonic hydrogen have led to a value of the proton charge radius which is in disagreement with both scattering experiments as well as laser-spectroscopic measurements in atomic hydrogen. This project involves the recalculation of one of the last possible theoretical explanations for the disagreement which has not yet been fully covered in the literature. The second problem involves higher order corrections in many-body systems. Beyond the two-body problem, it is impossible to analytically solve bound-state systems even in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Three aspects of higher-order corrections in helium-like systems which are of prime importance for the description of experiments will be studied. These include so-called relativistic Bethe logarithms in helium, as well as higher-order effects in the bound 'muonic helium' system. The calculations will be important in confronting the muonic hydrogen puzzle with other muonic bound systems, and, potentially, in determining the electron-muon mass ratio. Finally, Casimir effects, dynamic processes and atom-wall interactions will be studied. The atom-wall interaction is a vacuum-mediated interaction between an atom flying by a solid material ('wall') and depends on the functional form of the dielectric response function of the medium. The project includes an investigation, conceivably in collaboration with experimentalists, of the temperature dependence of the atom-wall interaction, which may have already been seen in an experiment, as well as details of the atom-wall interaction potential for the helium-alpha-quartz and helium-gold systems. Theoretical progress on the understanding of the quantum friction force, due to the dragging of the mirror charge inside the wall, also forms part of the current ject.<br/><br/>The cross-disciplinary proposal combines atomic theory and quantum-field theory in the low-energy domain to address fundamentally important questions and pressing current experimental-theoretical discrepancies. Advanced numerical methods and the education of graduate students and the development of postdoctoral research associates are cornerstones of the investigations. Potential applications of some of the developed numerical methods, beyond those devised for atomic-physics calculations, are currently being envisaged."
0.3,"Celtic art, Boy Scout knots, Mobius strip rings, and M.C. Escher's art have fascinated the viewer and challenged their ability to trace the origin of connectivity. For some time now, mathematicians have described the topology of rings and cyclic overlapping structures with their programmable qualities into the so-called Knot Theory. In polymer science, understanding how long polymer chains become tangled and how to get those tangled chains to dissolve in a solution can result in new materials with interesting physical properties and chemical properties that can extend the applications of plastics, coatings, rubber, and composites. There are many opportunities for training and mentoring future scientists in this interdisciplinary and practical field. This research helps preparing a workforce that solves complex problems and produces valuable products. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the design and synthesis of new catenated polymer and block copolymer compositions via monomer ring opening (RO) and macroinitiator ring expansion polymerizations (REP) or REP-ROP Polymerizations. By utilizing the Knot Theory, it may be possible to obtain various knotted macromolecules, which have controlled entanglements as well as block copolymer composition with high yields and high molecular weight. The approaches towards the synthesis of catenated macromolecules involve: 1) phenanthroline-based macroinitiator templates; 2) homopolymers and block copolymers derived from atom transfer radical polymerization methods and ring closures with atom transfer radical coupling; 3) ring expansion strategies with polycaprolactones; and 4) polymer reactions that modify the side groups and control the composition and interaction parameters of the chains. Characterization methods include nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, MALDI mass sppectrometry, atomic force microscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, and rheometry, which verify the polymer's chemical structure, topology, and phase separation in solution and solid state. Collaborations with polymer physicists, theorists, and rheologists are pursued to harness the properties of the catenated polymers as materials and compatibilizers for practical applications."
0.440202,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award that will lead to more accurate computer modeling of molecules, chemicals, and materials. To do this the PI will focus on the ""glue"" that binds one atom to another to form molecules and materials which has the technical name exchange-correlation energy. Making this energy smaller strengthens the ""glue"" because electrons avoid close approaches to other electrons which have the same electric charge. The density of electrons determines the exchange-correlation energy, but the exact formula is not known. Nevertheless, it is possible to use a computer to predict what molecules and materials can exist, and with what properties, by using an approximate formula. The PI has developed approximate formulas that lead to good predictions of the properties of many materials and molecules as compared with actual experiments. In this research the PI will develop even more accurate approximations for the ""glue"" that still lend themselves to efficient simulation of molecules, and materials on a computer. <br/>The PI's most recent approximate formula is called SCAN. As a feature, it shares all the attributes of the exact formula that are known from fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that are possible for an approximation like SCAN. Nevertheless, no formula of this type can be exact; approximations of this type introduce a spurious interaction of an electron with itself. A major goal of this project will be to develop a widely-useful correction to overcome this source of error for SCAN.<br/>The development of more accurate approximations for the ""glue"" that holds atoms together leads to better predictions for the properties of chemicals, molecules, and materials. These predictions can lead to the discovery of new materials with desired properties for a wide range of applications from building and construction, to sophisticated electronic devices, to biomaterials for medical applications, and more. This research enables better computer modeling of materials with potential impact on the Materials Genome Initiative. This award also helps support the PI's efforts to develop better ways to help educate more high-school physics teachers,and to involve undergraduate students in the research.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> The Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division contribute funds to this award that supports research in Kohn-Sham density functional theory, the most widely-used method to calculate ground-state energies or energy differences, equilibrium nuclear positions, and electron densities in atoms, molecules, and solids. The theory is exact in principle, although in practice the density functional for the exchange-correlation energy must be approximated. In the preceding award period, the Perdew research group developed SCAN, a ""strongly constrained and appropriately normed"" functional that is more accurate for diversely-bonded systems than comparably-efficient approximations. Satisfying all 17 known exact constraints that a semilocal functional can, the SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation could replace the widely-used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation.<br/><br/>In the current award period, extensive tests will be made for SCAN and for SCAN with a long-range van der Waals correction. These tests would include the formation energies which determine relative stabilities of molecules and solids from the elements in their standard states, large reference-data sets for sp-bonded and transition-element-containing molecules, the polyacetylene chain, the ground-state crystal structures of solids that have proven challenging to get correct for , fundamental band gaps of solids, surface energies and work functions of metals, and adsorption energies for molecules on surfaces, A refined self-interaction correction to SCAN would seek to preserve the excellent SCAN description of equilibrium bonds for weakly-correlated systems while improving the description of stretched bonds, charge transfers, and strongly-correlated systems. A SCAN-like additive correction to the fully-nonlocal random phase approximation would be developed. Proof would be sought for a hypothesized tight lower bound on the exchange energy of any spin-unpolarized density. Finally, exchange-correlation energy differences for selected systems would be analyzed in a way that could lead to a better understanding of electronic systems and their properties, and of the successes of SCAN. The development of more accurate approximations for exchange-correlation functions will result in better predictions for the properties of atoms, molecules, and materials and can lead to the discovery of new materials with desired properties for a wide range of applications from building and construction to sophisticated electronic devices to biomaterials for medical applications and more. This research enables better computer modeling of materials with potential impact on the Materials Genome Initiative. This award also helps support the PI's efforts to develop better ways to help educate more high-school physics teachers, and to involve undergraduate students in the research."

In addition to the US membership, 39 foreign institutions are non-voting affiliates of COMPRES. <br/><br/>The member institutions guide the direction of the consortium and define its missions. The intellectual and scientific goals of COMPRES are described in the report ""Understanding the Building Blocks of the Planet: The Materials Science of Earth Processes"", which came out of a 2009 planning workshop (www.compres.us). Through its support of advanced tools for Earth science experimentation, COMPRES enables research on the compositional and thermal structure of Earths interior, its evolution through time, and the dynamical behavior of the crust, mantle and core. There is an intimate relationship between the scientific goals of COMPRES and other geophysical disciplines. The results of mineral physics measurements carried out at COMPRES-supported facilities are critical for interpreting seismological and other geophysical observations in terms of the physical, chemical, and dynamical state of Earths interior. Many of the scientific objectives of the seismological community require investigations of the material properties of Earth materials at extreme pressures and temperatures, as pursued by the COMPRES community. Research done at COMPRES-supported facilities also addresses questions of direct societal impact, such as the causes of earthquakes, carbon sequestration, natural resources, and basic research into new advanced materials.<br/><br/>COMPRES supports the operations and equipment needs of three synchrotron beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory), and one at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). X-ray beam line X17B2 at NSLS is a center for rheology and equations of state measurements on materials at high pressures and temperatures, using the Large-Volume Multi-Anvil Press (LVP) and a Drickamer deformation apparatus. Beam lines X17B3 and X17C at NSLS are for high-energy X-ray studies of materials using the diamond-anvil cell (DAC) high-pressure apparatus, with resistance and laser heating. Beam line U2A is the worldleading facility for high-pressure infrared spectroscopy. Beam line 12.2.2 at the ALS is the COMPRES West-Coast facility for high-pressure high-temperature research using the diamond cell, and is developing into a center for resistance heating for DAC applications, as well as for laser-heating experiments. COMPRES also supports nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and synchrotron Mssbauer research at Sector 3 of the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Under the new 5-year cooperative agreement, COMPRES will establish a COMPRES Technology Center (COMPTECH) at the APS to develop high-pressure capabilities utilizing other advanced synchrotron techniques, such as single-crystal micro-diffraction, and momentum resolved inelastic scattering. With the planned completion of the NSLS-II - the newest US synchrotron ? in 2015, COMPRES will support high-pressure experimentation at the Project beam line XPD. In addition to providing facilities for large volume and diamond cell experiments upon startup of NSLS-II, a COMPTECH office at NSLS-II will help to exploit the unique capabilities of this new world-leading facility for a new generation of experiments at extreme pressure-temperature conditions."

Accurate and predictive calculations in quantum systems composed of many particles are a grand challenge in science. In these systems the delicate balance of competing tendencies creates rich possibilities of new phases of matter and collective phenomena, which offer the potential for remarkable material properties of great technological importance. This very richness and complexity, however, also means that the usual tools for quantitative calculations will tend to break down. The combination of methodological developments and the advent of high performance computing present an unprecedented opportunity to make fundamental progress in this problem now.

0.87,"Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics) is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments that acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. These experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics: What are the underlying constituents of matter? And how do they interact? With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics is complete. It provides an excellent description of known particles and forces. However, the most interesting questions remain open: What is the dark matter which pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the mechanism stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum corrections? The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale data samples to provide answers. Analyzing this data will require new and better tools. <br/><br/>First, the project will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas. It will develop software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core hardware. It will establish infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the experimental community. DIANA?s products will sit in the ROOT framework, already used by the HEP community of more than 10000 particle and nuclear physicists.

Combined with favorable oil and gas prices, these technological developments encouraged a vigorous pursuit of energy independence by the US. It is expected that the extraction of natural gas will increase by more than 100% in the next 15 years. One of the key environmental concerns is the accumulation of naturally occurring radioactive material during wastewater reuse and the lack of ultimate solutions that would address this problem once the wastewater reuse is no longer feasible. This study is designed to provide comprehensive understanding of the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material brought to the surface from deep geologic formations during storage and recycling of produced water.<br/><br/>This study focuses on fundamental experimental and modeling research necessary to advance understanding of the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material in deep geologic formations while maintaining its relevance to transformative engineering solutions in the control of naturally occurring radioactive material for successful water management strategy in oil and gas industry. Fundamental understanding of rock-water interaction that will be developed in this study will facilitate development of technical solutions to enable control of naturally occurring radioactive material in produced water. The combined experimental and modeling expertise of this research group will ensure deep understanding of key factors governing the fate of naturally occurring radioactive material in water treatment processes that use chemical precipitation and will have far-reaching consequences for oil and gas industry by facilitating science based solutions to address key environmental concerns that have led to significant public opposition in many parts of the world. The proposed study will attain fundamental scientific understanding of the phenomena that are relevant to other industries besides oil and gas (e.g., mining, nuclear) and will ensure more sustainable water management strategies by those industries. Water management solutions developed in this study will also provide impetus for the development of new solutions in other industries that are facing challenges with the control of radioactive elements.

0.297009,"The proposed research project is focused on the study of random matrices and random walks evolving in random media. Much of the existing theory of random matrices deals with normal matrices, which are stable under perturbations; many of the existing tools<br/>implicitly use either this stability, or some strong independence assumptions, even in deriving rough results. A major goal of the present proposal is to build on previous work of the PI and collaborators and develop techniques that work even in a context where both structural assumptions (normality or independence) fail. While the proposal discusses and addresses some very specific questions, it is part of a larger attempt to develop new techniques that would be applicable to a wide range of RMT questions. The second topic to be studied concerns random walks and branching processes in random environments. Though the theory of random walks is well developed, many gaps in understanding remain when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium. In spite of rapid progress that was achieved in the last few years by several researchers, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. The proposed project will built on previous work, by the PI and other researchers, with the goal of resolving some of these outstanding questions.<br/><br/>Matrices are the cornerstone of linear algebra, and are fundamental building blocks in operator theory. Random matrix theory (RMT) is concerned with the study of properties of random matrices, typically in the limit where the dimension of the matrix is large.<br/>Motivations and applications for this study come from several areas of mathematics (probability theory, number theory, representation theory), the physical sciences (especially, mathematical physics), statistics, and engineering (specifically, communication and information theories). In recent years, RMT has emerged as a major research area within mathematics, combining techniques from probability theory, operator algebras, complex analysis, and combinatorics. Several major (and fundamental) open questions have recently been resolved, especially concerning the universality of limit laws regarding the spectrum of large random matrices. The proposed research will seek to significantly expand the theory toward a class of matrices whose spectrum is not stable under (small) perturbations. While the focus of the research is theoretical, an impact on applications is expected, e.g. in evaluating the stability of complex systems, in computations related to quantum information theory, and in statistics. The second main focus of the study, random walks, are arguably the stochastic processes most studied by mathematicians, having the widest range of applications in fields as diverse as the physical sciences, engineering, and the social sciences. Though the theory of random walks is by now well developed, this is not at all the case when one changes the medium in which the walk evolves to a random medium, thus obtaining a random walk in random environment (RWRE). Such RWRE's can be used to model many problems of motion in random media in the physical and engineering sciences, and are mathematically appealing because on the one hand the model is very simply stated, while on the other hand established tools for studying processes in random media are not applicable in the study of RWRE. The goal of the current proposal is to develop new basic probabilistic techniques that will allow to make provable predictions concerning the behavior of RWRE. It is expected that such techniques will be useful in the study of other processes, and link naturally to the study of trapping models and reinforced random walks. While not explicitly targeted in this proposal, trapping models have recently been used to study the environmental impact of nuclear waste, and RWRE's can naturally be used in this context to model the spread of contamination in a real environment, once the required mathematical background and tools are in place."
0.099999,"There is an increasing amount of non-traditional software being developed by developers, i.e. software developed by people not formally trained in software engineering practices and developed in environments that place different constraints on software development than are found in more traditional IT software development environments.

0.383322,"Non-technical Abstract<br/><br/>Several elements in the periodic table when subjected to external high-pressure and high-temperature adapt novel structural modifications leading to improvements in their physical and mechanical properties. In certain cases, these novel crystal modifications with enhanced physical and mechanical properties can be retained after removal of pressure resulting in potential industrial applications. The conversion of graphitic carbon into diamond by application of high-pressure and high-temperature is a prime example of this research. This research program will carry out high-pressure high-temperature studies on transition metals and alloys that are widely used in aerospace, biomedical, and nuclear industry. This research is enabled by advances in the generation of ultra high pressure up to ten million atmospheres in the laboratory using an innovative design of diamond anvils in high pressure devices. This advance in high pressure technique coupled with very bright sources of x-rays allows us to probe changes in crystal structures so we can construct stability maps for various crystal structures at elevated pressures and temperatures. These stability maps will allow researchers to design new strategies to synthesize these materials in bulk form for industrial applications. The project participants will receive extensive research training at the premier national facilities employing x-ray synchrotron radiation in materials research leading to a pipeline of trained scientific workforce in high pressure science. Our long-term partnership with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the southeastern region will ensure participation of underrepresented minority groups in this research program. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The study of transition metals under extreme conditions has seen rapid progress in the last few years with the attainment of near Terapascal (1 TPa = 1000 GPa) static pressures using two-stage diamond micro-anvils along with the development of millisecond x-ray diffraction techniques using fast detectors at the synchrotron facilities. At the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a novel method for the fabrication of two-stage diamond micro-anvils using a chemical vapor deposition technique has been developed. In addition, rapid pressure and temperature changes can be applied to samples using piezoelectric drivers (dynamic diamond anvil cells) and boron-doped heating anvils, thus providing ideal tools to study phase transformations and transformation kinetics in transition metals and alloys under extreme conditions. In this study, a focus is on transformation kinetics of hexagonal close-packed (hcp-phase) to simple hexagonal (omega-phase) transformation and from omega-phase to body-centered cubic (bcc-phase) in Titanium-Vanadium (Ti-V) and Hafnium-Tantalum (Hf-Ta) alloys. The goal is to establish the occurrence of other novel phases like the orthorhombic modifications (gamma, delta, and eta phases) in early transition metals and alloys under hydrostatic (neon pressure medium) and non-hydrostatic (no pressure medium) conditions. In Osmium (Os) metal, structural anomalies have been observed at 150 GPa and 440 GPa at ambient temperature that warrant further investigations at elevated temperatures. It is anticipated that most of the early members of the transition metal series are converted in to nearly pure d-band metals as s-electron levels move above the Fermi-level at extreme pressures. This study would provide crystal structure data and pressure-volume data for this unique electronic state of transition metals and alloys under extreme conditions for direct comparison with the theoretical models."
0.36,"The project involves the modeling, analysis, algorithmic invention, and numerical analysis of novel models for three physical systems, namely diffusion, solid mechanics, and plasmas. In the first system, the PI considers a nonlocal, integral model for non-Fickian (or anomalous) diffusion. The model has as special cases fractional Laplacian and fractional derivative models but generalizes these models in several ways such as allowing for spatial heterogeneity and anisotropy, less smooth solution behavior, and a simple means for treating problems posed on bounded domains. The project addresses several issues that are crucial to the efficient, robust, and accurate approximation of the nonlocal diffusion model. In particular, the effects of truncating kernels and data so that computations can be done on finite domains are analyzed, combined finite element/domain and data truncation error estimates are obtained, and a goal oriented, adjoint equation-based grid adaptation methodology is developed, analyzed, and tested. In the second system, the PI considers the nonlocal, spatial derivative free peridynamics model for solid mechanics. The model allows for discontinuous solutions so it is especially well suited for modeling defects. As such, its efficacy has been demonstrated in several sophisticated applications, including the fracture and failure of composites, crack instability, fracture of polycrystals, and nanofiber networks. The project involves the development of a computational methodology that takes full advantage of the multiscale properties inherent in peridynamics and which results from the phenomenological horizon parameter that limits the extent of interactions. In the third system, both the Vlasov-Poisson and cold-ion systems for modeling the expansion of ions from high to low-density regions are considered. The project includes the development of a new cold-ion model that remains valid beyond the time of singularity creation, showing that solutions of the new model remain the limit (as the ion temperature tends to zero) of solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system, studying analytically and computationally the transition that occurs as the density ratio decreases from solutions having no singularities to ones that do, treating problems with multiple species of ions, and developing efficient numerical methods for two and three-dimensional settings.<br/><br/>The project addresses fundamental issues that arise in the mathematical and computational treatment of three physical systems that are of huge importance in a wide variety of applications. These include but are not limited to the nucleation and propagation of defects, (cracks, delaminations, etc.) in solid bodies (airplane wings, nuclear reactor containment vessels, etc.); anomalous diffusive behavior observed in subsurface water, oil, and gas flows, in animal foraging behaviors, in polymeric flows, in exotic materials, etc.; and in ionized flows in lasers, space propulsion systems, supernovae, etc. Obtaining useful information about such complex systems requires massive computational efforts which can be greatly aided by improvements in mathematical models, qualitative theoretical information about solutions of those models, and, most of all, by better, more efficient and more accurate computational algorithms. Because of the wide-ranging settings that the project impacts, the results obtained will be of great interest to scientists, engineers, and policy makers involved in, among other things, the theoretical study of physical phenomena, in the design and manufacture of new devices, and in the assessment of risks and design of remediations."
0.747179,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs, new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls. Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability, and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications, such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic dredging and excavation."
0.804263,"There is mounting evidence that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a subnuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale at which Inflation occurred. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor-to-scalar modes, r = T/S. Many theoretically favored models of Inflation produce this ratio between 0.01 and 0.1, corresponding to average amplitude from 30 to 100 nanoKelvins for the resulting CMB B-mode polarization patterns where they peak on scales of degrees. With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and ultimately detecting the CGB polarization signature, which is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. In 2005, the Community Task Force on CMB Research identified a target sensitivity of that ratio equaling to 0.02 as an immediate goal to detect the Inflationary gravitational waves imprint in the CMB polarization that pertain to the standard cosmological model. The newly installed 'Small Polarimeter Upgrades for DASI' (SPUD) reconfigured a five- receivers telescope to the ""South Pole Inflationary Cosmology Experiment"" (SPICE) that will: (a) Complete the CGB search in CMB B-mode polarization at 150 GHz, reaching depths which based on current sensitivity performance, that will detect the Inflationary CGB for r > 0.02; (b) Prove that this signal is cosmic in origin while separately measuring the Galactic foreground contamination at its minimum; (c) Detect gravitational lensing of CMB polarization on scales of ~1 degree, probing the CGB to the lensing confusion limit for degree-scale observations (r < 0.01) if the energy scale of Inflation is low; and (d) Surpass the instrumental sensitivity goals set forth for 2013 by the 2005 CMB Task Force recommendations. Detection of the CGB waves would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang theory. Indeed, its impact may be even broader as nuclear physics had matured enough prior to the establishment of the ""hot"" Big Bang model, while Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics: the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics, string theory, and the highest accessible energies. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science and train students."
0.154239,"Approximation defines our world. For example, the letters on this screen have smooth curves and bends. But zoom in and all you see are squares: pixels. The smaller the pixels (i.e., the finer the approximation), the smoother a curve looks. Add three colors and suddenly we can approximate a rainbow. In a sense, science is all about refining and improving approximations to reality. Take Newtonian physics, for example. It works great at medium scales, but breaks down when things are too big or too small. Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics work much better at those scales. And these theories require sophisticated mathematics. This focused research group project addresses several outstanding questions in operator algebras and their analogies in other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Operator algebras arose as a framework for quantum mechanics. Over the years many classical theories were extended to this noncommutative context: geometry, topology, probability and more. The PIs will spearhead an international effort to capitalize on recent connections between operator algebras and other areas such as dynamics, measure theory, coarse geometry and K-theory. Specifically, the PIs shall push analogies between nuclear dimension and asymptotic dimension, two notions defined via approximation and encompassing a huge swath of examples, to address K-theoretic questions such as the Universal Coefficient Theorem and the Baum-Connes and Farrell-Jones conjectures."
0.618918,"Intellectual Merit: The small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) known as U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 comprise a highly abundant class of RNA molecules that are required for pre-messenger RNA splicing in higher organisms. These snRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II with the exception of U6, which is synthesized by RNA polymerase III. Despite this difference in RNA polymerase specificity, U6 genes and the RNA polymerase II-transcribed snRNA genes utilize similar regulatory signals and overlapping sets of transcription factors for their expression. The main goal of the project is to gain an understanding of the structure-function relationships that are involved in recruiting the correct RNA polymerase to initiate synthesis of the correct snRNAs. Transcription of both classes of snRNA genes requires a unique protein factor referred to as the snRNA-activating protein complex (SNAPc). This factor recognizes an essential promoter element termed the PSE located in the DNA 40-75 base pairs (bp) upstream of the start site of RNA synthesis. In the fruit fly D. melanogaster (the model organism used in this project), DmSNAPc is composed of three subunits that together carry out sequence-specific recognition of the ~21 bp long PSEA (the fruit fly PSE). Even though a U1 PSEA and a U6 PSEA differ at only 5 of 21 nucleotide positions, this sequence difference plays a major role in determining the RNA polymerase specificity of fly snRNA genes. Furthermore, the three subunits of assume a different conformation when bound to a U6 versus a U1 PSEA. This conformational difference is believed to be responsible for the recruitment of the correct RNA polymerase. To better understand the conformational differences of DmSNAPc bound to U1 and U6 PSEAs, a novel technique developed in the PI's lab will be employed that uses site-specific protein-DNA cross-linking combined with chemical cleavage of the protein at defined sites. Contact points made between the largest DmSNAPc subunit and U6 promoter DNA will be compared with the contact points made between this subunit and U1 promoter DNA. Next, pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly on U1 and U6 promoters will be investigated, with primary emphasis on RNA polymerase II recruitment to the TATA-less U1 promoter, but analogous experiments will be performed to investigate Pol III PIC assembly on the U6 promoter. Finally, the overall contour shape of DmSNAPc bound to the U1 and U6 PSEAs will be studied by cryo-electron microscopy, and X-ray crystallography will be employed to investigate the structure of DmSNAPc and it subunits at the atomic level. The results of the research will contribute widely to the scientific community's understanding of gene expression at the level of RNA synthesis. Fruit fly U1 genes serve as a particularly tractable paradigm for investigating RNA polymerase II transcription complex assembly on TATA-less promoters, a process that is currently very poorly understood. More generally, this system serves as an excellent model for understanding how very subtle changes in macromolecular interactions and assembly can lead to significantly different biological outcomes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The research will be performed by students in satisfaction of their B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in biochemistry/molecular biology. The project will provide training for their future careers in the biotechnology industry, for advancement to graduate and professional schools, or to careers in academia as well as teaching at the community college level. San Diego State University, due to its border location and emphasis on undergraduate as well as graduate instruction, serves a large body of undergraduate students from underrepresented ethnic groups. The PI is active in undergraduate classroom teaching and has a strong track record and history of involving underrepresented students in research, from high school through the graduate level."
3.107325,"This PIRE project brings together two U.S. universities with six French and five Japanese institutions to focus on multiphase flows with technological applications. Multiphase flows are flowing streams of fluids that are mixtures of liquids with other liquids, gases, and/or solids; examples include oil and vinegar in salad dressing (liquid/liquid), water and air in soda (liquid/gas), or water and cement in concrete slurry (liquid/solid). Multiphase flows and their control play a vital role in many key technologies impacting the world economy, such as metallurgy, mineralogy, materials processing, devices for biological applications, and the automobile, pharmaceutical, aerospace, and energy industries. This project will advance materials engineering by investigating critical research challenges in multiphase flows - understanding and predicting the patterns, instabilities, and turbulence that arise - to develop and optimize materials and processes for industry. This PIRE team will integrate the results from across a related sets of experiments including: study of patterned flows and microfluidic mixing to improve micro-chip immunological assays; use of microactuators and microsensors to study instabilities and turbulence in multiphase systems; use of microgravity conditions to examine the role of fluid instabilities; experimental and computational study of dynamic flow of elongated particles/fibers; and expansion of current models of dispersed turbulent flow via large-scale simulation. <br/><br/>International collaboration is essential to advancing our understanding of multiphase flows. Complex multiphase flow research requires high speed computation and high-level laboratory experimentation in which all three PIRE partner countries have substantial complementary resources. The University of Florida is internationally recognized for its programs in multiphase thermo-fluid mechanics and flow control. Both Japan and France sustain strong research emphases in thermal-fluid mechanics with key centers of excellence in multiphase flow. Japan emphasizes technology in areas such as materials science, microgravity science, bioassays and aeropropulsion while France emphasizes technology in nuclear energy, environment, bio-sensors, and flow control. This award leverages strong existing research collaborations and reciprocated access for U.S. scientists and students to facilities and expertise not available in the U.S. The international collaboration will also help industries in all three countries to engage highly-trained personnel in fields involving applications of multiphase science and technologies.<br/><br/>The strength of this PIRE's educational program is its plan to train U.S. students as global professionals with versatility in professional abilities and attitudes that make them competitive in the global marketplace. U.S. graduate students will be supported to work in an international setting with foreign collaborators and advisors, functioning and communicating in a multi-cultural atmosphere. Unique educational opportunities include industry-relevant short courses, training in cutting-edge research, cultural awareness workshops, and international symposia and conferences. Internships in industrial research laboratories will give them access to networking opportunities with industry within an international context. Active recruitment of students from underrepresented groups will contribute to diversifying and internationalizing the body of U.S. students earning STEM graduate degrees. A certificate program in Multiphase Science and Technology will be developed and offered through online distance learning modules, thus making it available to international partners and their students, interested students at other U.S. universities, and as continuing education for industrial partners. U.S. researchers will also build skill sets needed for research in international contexts via cross-collaboration with international partners and co-advising foreign students. <br/><br/>This PIRE project is likely to have significant institutional impacts. It will strengthen and internationalize research networks that address complicated multiphase technological problems. It will help to build up an international engineering research center of excellence in complex fluids and multiphase flows with partnerships between international industry and academe that yield long-term benefit to the U.S. economy. Such partnerships will also encourage industry participation in education, international research cooperation, and student internships. The partner institutions are committed to exploring joint and dual degree programs, which would further internationalize the U.S. institutions and enrich collaborative opportunities for future students and faculty alike. Through these multifaceted initiatives and activities, this PIRE project will serve as a model for both U.S. and international partner institutions as they work to internationalize their own research and education portfolios. <br/><br/>U.S. partners include the University of Florida and Florida State University.

0.311452,"Peter Rossky from the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in research focused on understanding, at the level of atoms, the molecular arrangements and time-dependent processes that occur when chemical changes take place in liquid solutions or in unstructured solid materials. These include the changes that occur in biological materials, in semiconductor materials, and in plastics. Although computational modeling is increasingly able to describe these processes, serious challenges remain. For example, it is very important to be able to understand what happens to the energy that is deposited in molecules through the absorption of light. Such knowledge is a critical element for our understanding of the degradation of materials, of the functioning of solar cells, and of biological processes such as photosynthesis. The specific objective of the present studies is the development of new, generally applicable, theoretical and computational models and methods that can fully describe chemistry involving very light atoms and electrons, where quantum mechanics must be invoked. The algorithms being developed can be directly applied as computational tools for the design of advanced materials, pharmaceutical discovery, and nanoscale engineering. They can also impact critical practical issues, including affordable solar energy capture for sustainable energy and a sustainable climate. Outreach activities stemming from this work contribute to the future stability of the scientific workforce, as well as to the public's ability to participate in science policy.<br/><br/>The research efforts are developing new simulation algorithms for the quantum mechanical description of nuclear motion that go beyond presently available practical methods in key respects. The novel method is based on the dynamics of Wigner transform variables and is a rather direct generalization of an earlier linearized path integral (""classical Wigner"") approach. The new approach retains the ability to directly evaluate the dynamics of non-linear operators (e.g., in inelastic X-ray scattering) and describes vibrational dynamics without unphysical components associated with the simulation algorithm. Further, since the new method directly propagates the phase space points (in contrast to path-integral based approaches), there is good reason to believe that it can be integrated into a non-adiabatic electronic dynamics protocol. Applications to relatively well-characterized molecular systems are being used to test the capability of new methods. The molecular-scale insight needed to guide us to new materials with desired functions or insight into Nature's solutions will follow from the implementation of advanced computational science, coordinated with revealing experimental probes. The resulting capabilities form the basis for what may be the routine modeling methods of the future, just as the basic research of the last 50 years routinely provides for today's experimental researcher. Project efforts enhance education at all levels, including the professional development of graduate and postdoctoral students as researchers and educators with timely skills in the computational solution of physical problems."

0.466,"The propensity for bacteria to associate with surfaces in nearly all ecosystems far exceeds the tendency to persist in suspension, living freely in a planktonic state. Bacteria secrete proteins, polysaccharides, and other components to assemble a spider-web like matrix that surrounds cells to promote the formation of protective communities termed biofilms. The protective physical matrix enables bacteria to colonize and even thrive in an astonishing range of environments, in niches ranging from the harsh acidic microbial mats in Yellowstone to ship hulls and industrial oil pipelines. Improved biofilm models are crucial to understanding how they function. Across biology, chemistry, and materials research, measuring parameters of chemical, physical, and mechanical properties is key to understanding how complex assemblies function. In this project, experiments are designed to achieve breakthrough discoveries needed to transform biofilm descriptors from vague terms like ""glue"" and ""slime"" to scientific and quantitative descriptions based on chemical composition and molecular architecture by using high resolution techniques. The self-assembly of these macromolecular architectures by bacteria also inspire us to use or build such mechanically robust molecular frameworks for new functions.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will engage in broad dissemination of scientific research and educational outreach activities. She will mentor undergraduate and graduate students, including many from groups under-represented in STEM; design coursework changes to introduce more quantitative concepts into biochemistry courses; and lead comprehensive outreach activities, engaging students, teachers, and the general public. Major specific activities include: (i) developing a biochemical biofilm laboratory module for the high-school science curriculum with assistance from a high-school teacher who joins the PI's laboratory each summer, (ii) integrating exploratory-based lab modules in undergraduate laboratory courses to encourage true engagement and the hands-on ""a-ha"" moments that enhance learning; (iii) assisting in the mentoring of incoming first-generation and under-represented undergraduate students in preparation for university coursework in STEM; and (iv) sharing engineering protocols for a custom-built active-control feedback system to stabilize NMR pulse power levels over long acquisition times, enhancing the stability of NMR experiments and also of general value in spectrometer monitoring.

0.424954,"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research that will improve our understanding of how frozen ground behaves as it interacts with thermal changes in the surrounding environment. A key element in understanding soil freezing and thawing processes is the ability to predict the mass fraction and mobility of unfrozen water (that is, how much water remains liquid at below-freezing temperatures within frozen soils, and how it moves). Historically, microscale phenomena associated with unfrozen water has been challenging to measure and poorly understood. This research uses an innovative combination of state-of-the-art measurement techniques to quantify relationships among hypothesized key variables in soil freezing and thawing processes, namely unfrozen water content and mobility, soil zeta potential (a parameter related to mineral surface charge), and soil micro-fabric. Specifically, the PI will (1) measure mass and molecular mobility of unfrozen water in frozen cation-treated soils using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods; (2) correlate these with measurements of soil micro-aggregate formation and micro-fabric using X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methodologies; and (3) correlate these measurements to zeta potential of cation-treated soil particles at sub-freezing temperatures. Students recruited from the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) will participate in this CAREER research and in K-8 outreach through a hands-on geotechnical engineering module delivered to middle school-aged students.<br/><br/>The ability to accurately predict heat and mass balance of frozen soil systems, frozen soil strength, and frost heave magnitude - all of which depend on unfrozen water - will support planning for permafrost response to climate change, and will facilitate more efficient and economic engineering design for cold regions. Results from this CAREER research may be used to improve heat and mass transport models, frost heave models, and models of frozen soil creep by incorporating enhanced unfrozen water content functions, which will account for unfrozen water mobility and its dependence on soil-specific physicochemical properties. The improved models will have far-reaching effects, including: contributing to the scientific community studying methane release from degrading permafrost; serving as planning tools for Arctic communities that must relocate due to unstable permafrost; increasing the analysis accuracy of unstable slopes in frozen ground; resulting in more cost-effective designs accompanied by less structural damage and safety risks for projects such as buried chilled gas pipelines; and predicting frost heave susceptibility and magnitude more accurately, which will support design of safer, more durable roads in cold regions.<br/><br/>In terms of education, involving ANSEP students in this research will encourage underrepresented student groups to become engineering professionals with strong outreach skills, who can return to rural Alaska to inspire the next generation of engineers. Increasing the involvement of Alaskan Native students in frozen ground engineering will result in a stronger, highly-trained workforce, capable of addressing geotechnical problems unique to the Arctic, which is critical for the long-term viability of their communities and for the successful development of the Arctic, the next frontier in energy resource development. Exposing middle school-aged students to hands-on engineering activities and to problems germane to their local environment will promote an early interest in engineering that can segue into an engineering career."
0.176001,"Abstract <br/><br/>Understanding interesting physical phenomena often requires classifying potentially physical observable solutions as attractive critical points (or semi-stable long-lived orbits) of infinite dimensional dynamical systems through partial differential equation theory and numerical experiments, which provide a rich set of problems that can be accessible at all levels of research and training. Such solutions and their stability can be studied on long time scales in relation to small scale models for light in optical media in nonlinear Schrodinger and Dirac models, surface waves on a surface tension scale in the gravity-capillary equations, or molecular dynamics in terms of both large scale nonlinear diffusions of crystals through thermodynamic fluctuations as well as Lagrangian mechanics for smaller systems of electrons trapped in various nuclear potentials. They can also be studied in macroscopic systems such as interaction of surface waves and internal waves in coupled fluids models, vortex formation in fluid flow around biological objects in the Navier-Stokes equations with boundary, and dark matter formation in models from general relativity using Einstein-Scalar Field equations and their reductions as Schrdinger-Poisson models. In applications that include large systems, complicated nonlinearities, and/or interesting geometric settings, the analysis and numerics can become increasingly difficult. The quest to understand complexity in partial differential equation models has led to the development of dramatically new analytic and computational techniques to explore questions of symmetry, phase transitions, uniqueness for the attractive states, as well as generalizations of Fourier transform methods using scattering theory, spectral theory and microlocal analysis to understand their stability. These techniques can be applied for instance on spaces with curvature, boundary, metric singularities or other difficult features such as noise in a sample or trapping due to external potential wells. <br/><br/><br/>This proposal will involve research in partial differential equations directly related to optics and electronic structure with relevant boundary conditions and potentials, as well as other equations from fluid dynamics, general relativity and thermodynamic fluctuations on crystal surfaces. The PI will also work with postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates on integrated research into models, computation and experiment, especially though collaboration with members of the UNC Fluids Lab and International Mathematics Climate Network. An important aspect of that training will be to develop graduate courses and undergraduate courses in dynamics and computation to prepare trainees for a variety of careers in science. From a human resources standpoint, models like those in this proposal provide a large pool of problems that give a strong background in computation and geometry, as well as some applied statistics, which can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral, then applied in many scientific fields. In addition, the PI will continue to support the mathematics department role in the University of North Carolina Science Expo to work towards broader outreach goals of making mathematical sciences more accessible to the public."
0.263171,"Intellectual Merit: The genetic information in living organisms is stored as linear polymers of four DNA elements: guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. Chemical modifications of genomic DNA have principal roles in both natural gene regulation and DNA damage. In the cell, gene activity is regulated via enzymatic modification of cytosine (methylation). Cytosine modification rates are vital as their alteration can compromise cell function and organism survival. Unlike this modification of cytosine, which serves a regulatory role, modification of guanine (oxidation) is detrimental to the integrity of the genetic information. Left unrepaired, this common type of guanine damage (lesion) can lead to genome instability and mutations. In the human genome, there are many occurrences of cytosine and guanine being adjacent (clustered). Repair of a guanine lesion neighboring a modified cytosine is known to be compromised. Likewise, normal cytosine modification rates are altered within the sites containing a modified guanine. The chemical reasons for these adverse enzymological effects have yet to be determined. One of the missing links is the characterization of DNA with modified guanine and cytosine clustered together. To close this gap, the project aims to investigate the fundamental biophysics (stability, structure and dynamics) of DNA with a guanine lesion adjacent to a modified cytosine, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques along with molecular dynamics simulations. Such a comprehensive study of linked damage and regulatory modifications in DNA will be performed for the first time, pioneering new research in genome stability and regulation.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The project engages students at Western Washington University, a primarily undergraduate institution. Every effort is made to include students from minority and underprivileged populations. The participating students are involved in modern, inter-disciplinary academic research spanning areas of chemistry, biology, physics and computer science, a combination of principal scientific and instructional value. The project gives the students an early opportunity to experience the full scope of academic research in the lab. The students also communicate the results as co-authors, which further advances their professional development. As a benefit to a wider student body, some of the DNA samples developed during this investigation will be used for classes taught at Western Washington University.

0.225,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in next generation gas turbines where the heart of the engine, the combustor and the blade, are constructed from ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). These developments will spell a new phase of air transportation beyond the current engines that rely upon nickel-base superalloys, which have reached their maximum capability. The ceramic engines are eventually expected to be 25% more efficient. The CMCs are constructed from fibers of silicon-carbide that are spun into net shape and then infiltrated with an equally robust high temperature matrix, also made from silicon carbide-based ceramics. The fiber composites overcome the inherent brittleness of monolithic ceramics while retaining their mechanical and corrosion resistance in aggressive environments. These composites will have applications beyond gas turbines. They can become the critical breakthrough for the solar collector on Concentrated Solar Power systems, and have the potential to be used as cladding for nuclear fuels for greater safety and accident tolerance. The key innovation in this Phase I project is the development of an additive manufacturing process for creating a dense and defect free matrix from polymer precursors that convert into silicon carbide-based ceramics.<br/><br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project employs additive manufacturing to fabricate dense and defect free matrices for ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). These composites are constructed from fibers of silicon carbide (SiC). The innovation in this project lies in constructing the matrix from polymer precursors where nanoscale layers are deposited in quick succession to create the matrix. These silicon-based polymer precursors convert into ceramics when heated to ~800 oC. Nominal processing, also known as polymer-infiltration-and-pyrolysis, produces cracks in the matrix despite 24 hour curing cycles. These cracks degrade the strength of the composite. In this project nanoscale coatings are deposited in the form of thin layers of liquid and then pyrolyzed into the ceramic in just one or two seconds. The coatings are defect free and dense. The short curing time allows rapid deposition of layers. The CMC can be prepared from SiC fiber preforms in about four hours. The feasibility of the process has been demonstrated with carbon fibers under a grant from Ceramics Program at NSF. In this SBIR project, American Manufacturing LLC seeks to demonstrate the fabrication of CMCs made from silicon-carbide fibers, and demonstrate their viability for high temperature applications."
0.200299,"Technical description. <br/>The proposed International Research Experience for Students (IRES): Coupled Geomechanical Processes and Energy Technologies - Research Experience at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech - ENPC, France (?CGPET - ENPC?) aims to expose Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) undergraduate and graduate students to geomechanical research applied to energy technologies, immerse them in the academic culture of a leading European institution (ENPC), and inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to improve the sustainability and security of energy sources and production. Undergraduate and graduate students from Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (GT-CEE) will complete a two-month internship at ENPC Navier Laboratory, to work on research planned and supervised by dual ENPC and GT-CEE faculty mentors. Navier Laboratory gathers world?s experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, and has unique experimental, imaging and computational facilities especially adapted for geomechanics. Topics of study envisioned in this IRES involve fundamental research in the physics of thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical coupled processes in geomaterials, multi-scale modeling of porous networks, three-dimensional image analysis and advanced numerical simulation techniques. The ?CGPET- ENPC? program will start with five teams of dual mentors, who will work on the following subjects: (1) Clay nano-poromechanics for carbon dioxide sequestration, (2) Characterization of particulate pore structures for geological storage, (3) Micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue in salt rock for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), (4) Reactive fluid injection and withdrawal in rock, for oil and gas recovery and geothermal energy systems, and (5) Freeze/thaw cycles and sulfate attacks for improved cement-based buffers. Every year, a GT-CEE mentor will spend the last week of IRES participants? internship at ENPC, to work with his/her ENPC collaborator and supervise GT-CEE students? final research presentations; similarly the ENPC mentor will spend the week following the internship period at Georgia Tech. <br/><br/>Broader description. <br/>Fundamental understanding of soil, rock and cement-based materials is needed to address society?s most pressing needs in energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, geothermal systems), energy storage (e.g., CAES) and waste management (e.g., nuclear waste disposals, carbon capture). Through their engagement in a project aimed to improve energy geotechnologies, IRES participants will discover the responsibility of researchers towards their sponsors, their scientific community and society at large. Students selected for this CGPET ? ENPC program will have an international experience as part of a cohort through cultural and professional activities, and will contribute to build and maintain a global network of scholars through public research presentations at ENPC and GT, wikipage postings, academic publications, and mentoring of new IRES participants. Currently, most students enrolled in Civil and Environmental Engineering discover soil mechanics during their senior year, through the course of Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering. Activities planned before, during and after the ENPC internships will expose a broad population of GT students to geomechanical research, which will provide opportunities to inspire and attract more students in the pursuit of a scientific career. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students from ENPC and GT-CEE is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in energy geomechanics. This IRES will also serve a broader effort to share knowledge, expertise and resources between Europe and the United States, and to explore new ways to initiate scientific collaborations between high-ranked education and research institutions around the world."
0.163586,"As the most commonly observed objects, stars remain at the forefront of astrophysical research. Technical advances in detectors, computer processing power, networks and data storage have enabled new sky surveys. Many of these search for transient events at optical wavelengths, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS1 that probe ever-larger areas of the sky and ever-fainter sources, opening up the vast discovery space of ""time domain astronomy"". The recent Kepler and COROT space missions achieved nearly continuous monitoring of more than 100,000 stars. The stellar discoveries from these surveys include revelations about stellar evolution, rare stars, unusual explosion outcomes, and remarkably complex binary star systems. The immediate future holds tremendous promise, as both the space-based survey Gaia and the ground based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come to fruition. This tsunami of data has created a new demand for a reliable and publicly available research and education tool in computational stellar astrophysics that will reap the full scientific benefits of these discoveries while also creating a collaborative environment where theory, computation and interpretation can come together to address critical scientific issues. This demand by the stellar community led to our release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project in 2011. MESA has driven, and will continue to drive with support from this award, innovation in the stellar community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, and cosmological communities. Educators have widely deployed MESA in their undergraduate and graduate stellar evolution courses because MESA is a community platform with an active support network for leading-edge scientific investigations. Stellar astrophysics research, and all the communities that rely on stellar astrophysics, will be significantly enhanced by sustaining innovative development of MESA.<br/><br/>This award supports the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project and user community. MESA solves the 1D fully coupled structure and composition equations governing stellar evolution. It is based on an implicit finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls; state-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion, boundary conditions, and changes to the mass of the star. MESA is an open source library that employs contemporary numerical approaches, supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP, and is written with present and future multi-core and multi-thread architectures in mind. MESA combines the robust, efficient, thread-safe numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars. Innovations in MESA and its domain of applicability continues to grow, just recently extended to include giant planets, oscillations, and rotation. This project will sustain MESA as a key piece of software infrastructure for stellar astrophysics while building new scientific and educational networks."
0.144981,"Lightning strikes on Earth generate bursts of radio waves called whistlers that can travel upwards into space and scatter high-energy electrons into the atmosphere causing losses from the trapped radiation belts. When these whistlers are generated, they typically become trapped between the conducting surface of the Earth and the lower ionosphere, the Earth-ionosphere wave-guide, and can be observed thousands of kilometers away from the original lightning strikes. If they strike the ionosphere at the correct angle though, whistlers can pass though the Earth-ionosphere wave-guide and move upward. This is believed to occur mostly at high latitudes dropping in significance approaching the low-latitude ionosphere and ceasing near the magnetic equator. Whistlers moving upward from low latitudes will interact with the inner radiation belt, those moving upward at higher latitudes with the outer radiation belt. Recent observations imply that more whistlers actually enter the ionosphere at low latitudes than previously believed but the reasons are not understood. The goal of this proposal is to assess the influence of lightning-generated whistlers on the low-latitude inner radiation belt. It has recently become apparent that understanding this process and others that control radiation belt intensity is important for national security. A high-altitude nuclear explosion is estimated to enhance the radiation belts by a factor of 1,000 to 10,000 destroying satellites in low and medium Earth orbit in a matter of weeks to months and crippling critical societal infrastructures. A detailed knowledge of the radiation belts will enable the design of technologies to potentially mitigate such hostile enhancements. This project enables the training and mentoring of a graduate student at the University of Washington contributing to the creation of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The specific technological approach in the proposed work is novel. An extensive database of 3-channel electric field observations taken at +/- 26 degrees latitude by the C/NOFS satellite will be analyzed to extract information on the wave vectors, polarization and Poynting flux of the whistlers. Normally, this would require observations of both the wave electric and magnetic field vectors. However, by making the reasonable assumption of no wave electric field along the direction of the background magnetic field, this information can be extracted from the wave electric field observations alone. Once the wave vector is calculated in this way, it will be used as input to a chain of modeling tools to trace the whistler backwards from the satellite to the source lightning in the lower ionosphere and then compared to observations at that location from a ground-based lightning detection network."
0.2984,"Diatoms are microscopic aquatic organisms that are collectively responsible for approximately 20% of the photosynthetic activity on Earth. However, little is known of the response of these important organisms to changes in their environment. The primary goal of this project is to understand how these organisms sense the environment and alter their physiology to optimize their growth and productivity. This project will develop important novel tools that are anticipated to be of broad value to the research field, and will elucidate the mechanisms by which changes in the environment influence cell physiology. It will provide research opportunities for undergraduates and advance public science education.<br/><br/>This project will elucidate how simple environmental signals lead to rapid and reversible physiological responses in a model marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The signal transduction pathways that facilitate these responses are virtually unknown. The hypothesis will be tested that retrograde signals emanating from the electron transport system in the plastid are the primary means by which diatoms translate environmental signals into nuclear gene expression, leading to reversible physiological responses. Based on a bioinformatics analysis, a reverse genetics approach will initially be used to target five genes hypothesized to represent major components of the retrograde signal transduction system in diatoms. The project will utilize a rapid and robust gene-editing approach based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology, combined with a technique based on self-processing ribozyme sequences that flank the guide RNA to target the genes encoding the putative signal transduction proteins."
0.15,"Moore's Law, which predicts that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years, has been a major driver for the US economy for decades. Unfortunately, technological and fundamental challenges associated with continued device shrinking make the current rate of progress unsustainable. Recently, 3D integrated circuit technology has emerged as a leading approach to keep up with Moore's Law by stacking chips rather than by shrinking device dimensions. To achieve 3D integration, new joining technologies for interconnection and stacked bonding must be developed. Bonding by low volume solder interconnects is specially promising due to their good electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. This collaborative research award supports fundamental research to obtain the knowledge needed for the development of low volume solder interconnects. Research results will not only help realize the full potential of this new bonding technique in 3D integrated circuit packaging, but also be used to improve joining methodologies important in the aerospace and nuclear power industries and in power electronics and thermal management applications. Moreover, the project will help establish an effective collaboration between the two PIs who are both from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The small dimensions of low volume solder interconnects make it possible for the solder joints to solidify isothermally through the formation of intermetallic compounds at the expense of the liquid solders. This technique, also known as Transient Liquid Phase Bonding, allows the formation of a joint at temperatures lower than the expected operating conditions, minimizing damage to the temperature-sensitive components of the circuits from overheating. However, the small dimensions of low volume solder interconnects lead to large current densities during operation. These large current densities induce large electrical, thermal, and mechanical driving forces which give rise to complex microstructural processes. This research aims to advance the fundamental understanding of the complex microstructure processes in low volume solder interconnects, in particular about the important microscopic mechanisms governing processing-microstructure-property-performance relationships. The research team will develop an integrated multi-physics phase field modeling and perform systematic simulation studies of the microstructure formation and evolution during processing, operation, and damage of low volume solder interconnects. The simulations will be used to correlate macroscopic processing parameters and operating conditions to microscopic phenomena involving diffusion, current flow, heat transfer and stress concentration, and elucidate the mechanisms of defect formation."

0.174634,"Technical Description<br/><br/>Despite significant advances in structural materials, catastrophic beam-column joint failures in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings persist in being a problem during earthquakes. The behavior and failure mechanisms in RC joints have been extensively studied in the past and are well understood under simple (planar) loading conditions. Current practice tells us to increase the joint dimensions or the amount of reinforcing steel to enhance the capacity of the joints and prevent premature failure. However, this approach is definitely not sustainable. Additionally, as observed in recent earthquakes, this practice does not always prevent catastrophic failures in the joint region, leading to the conclusion that the behavior of joints under complex (multi-axial) loading conditions is still not well understood.<br/><br/>In this project, high-performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) will be selectively used at the beam-column joints to improve the structural performance of buildings while keeping the additional costs at a minimum. Using experimental and computational methods, a comparative damage evaluation and life-cycle cost assessment of building with RC and HPFRC joints will be conducted. Analysis of joints is a difficult task because of the complex load transfer and the behavior of materials under multi-axial loading. Therefore, two multi-axial (6 degree-of-freedom) loading units will be used to impose realistic loading and boundary conditions on the joints, and a digital-image correlation system for non-contact deformation measurements (DIC) will be used to obtain full-field 3-D strain maps to study critical deformation states that lead to the initiation of damage as well as its progression until complete failure. These research activities are anticipated to yield critical new knowledge and understanding of the behavior of RC and R-HPFRC joints, and reliable computational tools to study the RC/reinforced-HPFRC material and joint behavior.<br/><br/>Broader Significance and Importance<br/><br/>The proposed novel approach is expected to transform the design and construction of RC beam-column joints over the long-term. A direct benefit of this project to society is the improvement in public safety in response to earthquakes. An additional benefit is increased sustainability in the form of reduced direct and indirect economic losses and environmental impacts. The achievements in this project will be a large step in reaching the ultimate goal of resilient and sustainable civil infrastructures. The proposed joint concept also has broad applicability in other types of concrete construction, including offshore and nuclear structures. The data collected from these novel testing and measurement approaches will serve as benchmarks for the development of new theories for numerical modeling and engineering simulations, which could not be considered previously because of the lack of supporting experimental data.<br/><br/>Broadening Participation Activities<br/><br/>The University of Houston (UH) is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The UH student body of nearly 40,000 students is one of the most diverse in the United States. Educational modules will be developed and introduced in three courses to influence the education of more than 100 students per year. Because of the inherent campus diversity, these educational initiatives will naturally reach a diverse audience. Graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited from underrepresented groups. In collaboration with a local high school with more than 90% underrepresented students, a field trip will be organized every year for 25 students to visit the UH campus and participate in hands-on training. In addition, one high school teacher will be recruited every summer to gain exposure to research activities and help develop a course module for high school physics courses. Through the developed education activities, high school teachers, high school students, and undergraduate and graduate students will have an opportunity to interact and learn from each other. The course modules will directly derive from the research findings and be implemented in high school and college level courses, thereby naturally integrating research and education.<br/><br/>This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division."

In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.

0.266414,"The goal of this research is to develop a new procedure for nondestructive testing of built structural components. The project will quantify the multi-directional state of stress of loaded structural elements including residual stresses. The proposed approach uses nonlinear Rayleigh Waves for assessing the state of stress in normal and shear directions. The hypothesis is that acoustoelasticity describes the relationship between stress and ultrasonic waves. This approach will quantify three stress components through use of Rayleigh Waves. These waves interact with shear stress and permit three angled ultrasonic measurements to solve three unknown stress values simultaneously. The research involves analytical formulations of propagation of Rayleigh Waves; the numerical simulation will be validated with laboratory experiments. This approach has the potential of applicability to a variety of structural components of bridges, nuclear power plants and others.<br/><br/>The penetration depth of the Rayleigh wave depends on the perturbation frequency. This property will be utilized to quantify the normal and shear stress components. A range of excitation frequencies will be studied to understand the influence of shear stress on the ultrasonic waves, and quantify the nonlinearity coefficients for three directions. The basic equations of nonlinear ultrasonic will be modified to include the shear stress term; the resultant equations will be verified with the laboratory experiments. The measurement approaches to be tested in this project include piezoelectric receiver-transmitter with the coupling correction, electromagnetic transducer system and piezoelectric coupled-laser induced ultrasonic waves. The stress level resolution is targeted at 10 MPa with 90 percent confidence level."
0.299969,"Today's economy and society are highly dependent on liquid fuels for transportation. Currently, more than 90 percent of the liquid transportation fuels used in the U.S. are petroleum-based. It is imperative to develop alternative liquid fuels that are domestically produced and environmentally benign. Biofuels, derived from cellulosic biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues and dedicated energy crops, offer one of the best near- to mid-term alternatives. Size reduction of cellulosic biomass is the key step in the manufacturing of biofuels. Size reduction is an energy intensive process, and particle size dictates the energy consumption in this process. This award supports research to understand the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and biofuel yield. Successful completion of this research will build a foundation for future biofuel manufacturing technologies. This research will have a significant impact on the overall cost and energy balance of biofuel manufacturing, greatly benefiting the U.S. economy and energy security, as well as the environment and society, in general. This project will have a positive impact on engineering education. A new course accompanied by hands-on lab sessions will be created to strengthen the undergraduate engineering curricula and engage students in participating projects on renewable energy manufacturing. <br/><br/>The research objective is to test three hypotheses to explain inconsistency in the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and enzymatic hydrolysis sugar yield. In this research, it is hypothesized that the inconsistences are caused by the use of different sugar yield definitions, particle size ranges, and pretreatment methods. The prevailing biofuel manufacturing technology and the three most widely used cellulosic biomass currently in the industry, wheat straw, corn stover, and switchgrass, will be used in the research. Experimental investigations on both lab and pilot scale biofuel conversion facilities will be conducted to test the hypotheses. Additionally, structural features, morphological changes, and chemical compositions of cellulosic biomass will be characterized by using electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, UV spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography, IR spectroscopy, Simon's stain, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Based on the experimental results, a sugar yield model, incorporating all the significant structural, morphological, and chemical features, will be developed and validated. The outcome of this research will provide insights in the dynamic degradation of sugar compounds during hydrolysis. It will advance the knowledge base needed to make both strategic and operational decisions in biofuel manufacturing."
0.416307,"Even after more than a decade of great discoveries, the neutrino remains the most mysterious of the known fundamental particles. Basic questions about its properties endure; the most basic being whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle. If true, this Majorana nature of the neutrino would have profound implications to particle physics and cosmology, including an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The only feasible experimental probes of the Majorana nature of the neutrino are experiments searching for the rare nuclear process, neutrinoless double-beta decay. The current set of experiments will probe the parameter space for Majorana neutrinos in the inverted mass hierarchy. The next generation of experiments will need to push into the normal mass hierarchy which requires an order of magnitude increase in mass and background suppression. <br/><br/>Liquid scintillator detectors scale well to large masses but advances are needed to obtain increased background suppression.

A modified version of the series will also be presented at Santa Monica College. Furthermore, this grant will sponsor an additional slot in UCLA's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program."
0.3,"Jones / Hayes<br/>1403239 / 1403298 <br/>Collaborative Research: Characterizing Interactions of Carbon Dioxide with Tailored Adsorbing Materials for Capture of Carbon Dioxide from Power Plant Exhaust Gas and Ambient Air<br/><br/>Capturing CO2 from ambient air, or air capture, has significant technical challenges. The concentration of CO2 in air (~ 400 ppm) is far less than the CO2 concentrations in other applications such as post-combustion flue gas treatment. Any air capture process must use minimal amounts of energy, ideally from a distributed renewable source such as solar thermal energy. To apply air capture or conventional Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) on large scales, low cost and highly durable materials are required. <br/><br/>Tailored carbon dioxide adsorbents that combine nitrogen-bearing chemicals on solid sponge-like supports are perhaps the only class of adsorbents that might be practical for air capture applications. These materials are also important in CO2 removal from flue gases. These gas separation processes require a material to selectively removes CO2 (leaving other species behind) in the temperature range of 0-65 C, and in an environment where water is ubiquitous. Under these conditions, many types of adsorbents can be effectively ruled out. Some (physisorbents) will not effectively adsorb CO2 under these conditions because water competes with the carbon dioxide for sites within the material. Some other chemical types (chemisorbents) require high temperature operating conditions. <br/><br/>In contrast,the PIs propose to use supported amines to adsorb large volumes of CO2. The amines are also selective for CO2. Even when the carbon dioxide is fairly dilute, as in air, these materials are able to withdraw the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Thus, the proposed work here focuses on fundamental characterization of connections between CO2 and the specialized adsorbents, targeted towards conventional CCUS. <br/><br/>The purpose of the proposed work is to provide a comprehensive study of specialized solid amine adsorbents in cycles of carbon dioxide adsorption and desorption relevant to CO2 capture from industrial emissions like power plant flue gas and ambient air. The work will bring together traditional adsorption/desorption studies with structural characterization techniques applied to these materials, coupled with computational studies. A particularly innovative aspect will be the application of three different in-situ spectroscopic techniques, infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the structure of the CO2 as it adsorbs to the surface of the specialized amine adsorbent. <br/><br/>A cost-effective technology that could capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air could minimize the problems associated with transporting large volumes of CO2 from point source emitters (e.g. coal-fired power plants) to sites suitable for geological sequestration. Unlike conventional Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) from large power plant exhaust gases, which can at best slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, direct air capture, if widely adopted, can reduce the atmospheric CO2 level. This technology can impact distributed emissions sources (e.g. vehicles) that are currently beyond the reach of carbon capture technologies. The fundamental scientific investigations will provide new insights that will impact a wide array of CO2 adsorption technologies, including post-combustion CO2 capture, the direct extraction of CO2 from ambient air, purification of natural gas streams, and adsorption of CO2 on similar nitrogen-bearing materials for catalysis. <br/><br/>The collaborative project engages scientists from two disciplines, (i) chemical and biomolecular engineering and (ii) chemistry and biochemistry, with student exchanges and collaboration fostering communication across the boundaries of science and engineering. <br/><br/>The project also has significant potential to impact groups that are historically under-represented in science and engineering. PIs will actively recruit under-represented students to take part in this research, engaging Georgia Tech programs such as the Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program. Additionally, the Institute for School Partnership (ISP) at Washington University will engage secondary school teachers and teach them about CCUS."

The project will also sequence genes thought to be involved in selenium hyperaccumulation to determine if they have been subject to natural selection. This research will provide one graduate student and undergraduates with training in molecular, chemical, and bioinformatics techniques and will also supply molecular resources for population genetic studies of poorly known North American Astragalus species.<br/><br/>Twenty-five Neo-Astragalus species from two traditional taxonomic groups have been identified as selenium hyperaccumulators; however, it is not known if these groups are monophyletic. The researchers will sample these selenium hyperaccumulators and other species from across the clade and reconstruct a phylogeny using a target-enrichment approach for sequencing low-copy nuclear loci in order to infer the number of times selenium hyperaccumulation has evolved. Analytical chemistry methods will be used to survey selenium accumulation in relevant species, and phylogenetic ancestral state reconstruction will be used to characterize the number of origins of selenium hyperaccumulation from the resulting phylogeny. This approach can quantify the relative contribution of ecologically driven speciation and allopatric speciation in light of the number of origins of the cryptic trait, their phylogenetic position, and geographic ranges of the different species."
0.440126,"This project seeks to advance the scientific understanding of the effect of bombardment of surfaces in space by fast charged particles (ions) from the Sun. Such effects include erosion as well as changes in both the chemical composition and the appearance. The studies will be done in the laboratory, in conditions similar to those existing in astronomical bodies without atmosphere. Examples of these bodies are the Moon and asteroids, which are the subject of planned human space missions. The results from the studies will advance science at the fundamental level but also will be applicable to new energy technologies; ion bombardment, for example, contaminates and limits the life of nuclear fusion reactors. The project results are also relevant to the studies of advanced materials; erosion by fast ions, for example, is of practical importance in the fabrication of high-temperature oxide superconductors and in thin dielectrics for use in microelectronics and photonics. The research will involve training of students and postdoctoral researchers in a unique set of experimental techniques.<br/><br/>The study will be the most accurate to date in reproducing the effects of the wind ions on the surface of the Moon, asteroids and other airless bodies in the inner solar system. The laboratory studies will use ultrahigh vacuum, in situ chemical analysis, and mass-selected ion beams. We will examine samples of lunar soils, meteorites and simple minerals using multiple surface analysis techniques and optical spectroscopy. The basic phenomena to be studied quantitatively include sputtering (the ejection of atoms and molecules by energetic ions), changes in elemental and chemical composition, and changes in optical reflectance. The project will examine chemical reactions induced by implanted ions, including radiation-enhanced aqueous alteration, quantify the volatiles produced, and measure the magnitudes of sputter erosion and re-deposition. For the first time, the studies will use simultaneous irradiation with both protons and helium ions, to unveil synergistic effects; irradiation of samples coated with thin ice will simulate interfacial chemical reactions that may occur in asteroids; in situ examination of elemental and chemical composition, including surfaces of carbonaceous chondrites in meteoritic samples. The study on radiation-enhanced aqueous alteration is expected to aid interpretation of asteroid Ceres, a target of the current Dawn mission of NASA. The project will also involve graduate student training."
0.132941,"How is biodiversity generated and maintained? Much evidence suggests that parasites play an important role in both the origin and the maintenance of biological diversity. This project focuses on one of the most diverse groups of organisms on the planet: herbivorous insects, their parasites, and their microbes. The project targets three economically important groups of organisms: plants in the pumpkin/cucumber family, true fruit flies that attack these plants, and parasitic wasps that kill the flies. These wasps belong to a highly diverse and little studied group of species. Each wasp species can kill only one fly species; wasps attacking the ""wrong"" species of fly die. These bi-directional lethal interactions may be mediated by microbes (in wasps, flies, or both), by traits of flies' immune systems, or both. This project is designed to uncover the mechanisms (evolutionary, ecological, and immunological) affecting interactions that may help explain the diversity of life. Many species of true fruit flies are major agricultural pests; this project will greatly increase knowledge about factors contributing to their susceptibility to parasitoids. <br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses that predict that: 1) defenses of parasites and their hosts affect diversification rates; 2) mechanisms of virulence differ among lineages, and 3) selection arising from predator-prey interactions can affect rates of species-formation. To discover and identify mechanisms of diversification, participants will generate and analyze molecular 1) high-resolution genetic data, multiple nuclear loci, and mtCOI haplotypes to delineate species, and resolve deeper phylogenetic relationships; 2) microsatellites and ddRAD-seq markers to discover and quantify fine-scale genetic diversity within and among populations; 3) phylogenies and field experiments to test hypotheses about mechanisms generating and controlling diversity on ancient, recent, and contemporary timescales.

Membrane proteins perform a plethora of biological functions, yet the number of their solved structures remains relatively small. The solid-state NMR technique allows researchers to perform structure-function studies of MPs that are difficult or impossible to crystallize at nearly physiological conditions. NMR spectroscopic methods developed during this research expand capabilities of this technique to multihelical MPs.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this project is to transform solid-state NMR of oriented membrane proteins (MPs) by developing new spectroscopic tools including methods for distance measurements and assignment of crowded spectral regions.

Dynamic properties of lipid bilayers are probed including rotational diffusion of membrane-embedded proteins and the bilayer viscosity. Potential future applications include structure determination of the human Acetylcholine receptor involved in the Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. As broader impacts of this project, the highly interdisciplinary nature of this research provides versatile training for the young scientists involved.

Improving the preparation for, response to, and recovery from disasters can reduce damages, relieve human suffering, and speed up recovery. Among disasters, a multi-hazard is a sequence of disasters in which the first disaster causes the subsequent disasters, making it far more difficult for emergency response teams to handle all of them. For example, the March 11, 2011, Tohoku, Japan, earthquake triggered an unprecedented tsunami, which led to flooding at, and partial meltdown of, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. A more frequent example of multi-hazards is landslides, which can be triggered by many causes including earthquakes, rainfall, and man-made environmental changes.<br/><br/>While the detection of a single disaster usually only requires one kind of dedicated sensor, for example, seismographs can detect earthquakes reliably, multi-hazards often require a combination of various kinds of sensors for the detection of the multiple events in the sequence. Indeed, the detection of multi-events in general and multi-hazards in particular is a non-trivial problem due to the various kinds of events involved and the large number of combinations that make offline combinatorial analysis impractical. In the case of landslides, their detection is complicated further by the several possible and unrelated causes of landslides (e.g., earthquake and rainfall), each requiring a different kind of sensor.<br/><br/>In this project, the team is building a landslide detection system, called LITMUS, that integrates data from two physical sensors -- USGS Global Seismographic Network (GSN), NASA Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) -- with data from pervasive social media platforms. This integration of multiple heterogeneous sensors in LITMUS is an illustrative example of successfully applying big data software tools and analytics techniques to solve real-world problems. Specifically, the team is extending geo-tagging to relevant data items, which are filtered in several stages to reduce noise and false positives, and applying machine learning, information retrieval, and semantic web techniques to each data stream. Finally, filtered social media data are being cross-referenced with physical events from the same geo-location to generate supporting evidence for landslide detection. A LITMUS prototype has been detecting more landslides around the world than traditional landslide reporting systems: tests with live streaming data show that the combined result is a list of landslide events that has included the USGS authoritative list, plus many other confirmed landslides around the world."
1.117078,"Organisms utilize binuclear non-heme iron enzymes to facilitate a wide range of chemical reactions using O2. As examples, humans need ribonucleotide reductase to generate DNA building blocks, and classes of bacteria use soluble methane monooxygenase to convert methane (a greenhouse gas) to methanol (a usable fuel). These enzymes have been targeted for the development of anti-cancer drugs and biofuel catalysts. Understanding their chemistry at a molecular level requires elucidating structural changes of the iron active core over the catalytic reaction; however, many of these are not accessible with traditional spectroscopic techniques. Thus, this project includes the development of new spectroscopic methodologies that utilize intense magnetic fields, circularly polarized light, and third-generation synchrotron radiation. Experimental data combined with quantum mechanical calculations will define reaction mechanisms of six enzymes and related models. The molecular level insight gained from this project will promote drug discovery and biotechnology. The methods developed have impact on many areas of science and are made available through numerous national and international collaborations, which are now expanding to undergrad-only U.S. institutions. This project also includes multiple outreach efforts, including participation of high school teachers/students in summer research in our labs and other K-12 programs. The PI has trained a large number of highly successful scientists and edits major scientific publications.<br/><br/>The binuclear non-heme enzymes form expanding classes that activate O2 for H-atom abstraction, desaturation, hydroxylation, and electrophilic attack, and reduce O2 to H2O and NO to N2O. The PI has been developing spectroscopic methodologies to probe their O2 activating reduced states (variable-temperature/variable-field magnetic circular dichroism, VTVH MCD,) and their oxygen intermediates (nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy, NRVS). The focus is now on: 1) understanding the mechanism of O2 activation by 1e- reduction (myoinositol oxygenase, the prototype that activates O2 as bound superoxide); 2) developing/using NRVS/MCD to define the nature and activation of peroxo-2FeIII intermediates; 3) extending Aim 2) to the high-valent intermediates Q in soluble methane monooxygenase and X in ribonucleotide reductase; 4) defining the mechanisms of O2 and NO reduction in flavin diiron proteins and other related classes; 5) continuing to develop/use VTVH MCD and other spectroscopies to understand structure/function correlations in new classes of these enzymes. These studies over a wide range of binuclear iron enzymes establish general principles utilized by multicenter enzymes for O2 activation and in directing catalysis."
0.345,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>This project aims to gain insight into the size-dependent evolution of the melting and Debye temperatures, thermal expansion coefficient, sintering behavior and phonon density of states of supported metallic nanoparticles. As nanoparticle size decreases, it becomes progressively more difficult to produce samples with a well-defined size distribution. Small changes in size produce a large change in the fraction of atoms at free surfaces relative to those in contact with the support. Small nanoparticles are expected to be strongly affected by their local environment, such as the supporting materials and surface adsorbates. This study addresses these challenges through a combination of highly controlled sample synthesis to produce large volumes of well-defined ordered metal nanostructures through inverse micelle encapsulation and highly sensitive in situ and ex situ characterization techniques at shared user facilities (Brookhaven National Laboratory-BNL and Argonne National Laboratory) as well as in the PI's research lab. The material systems under investigation include Pt and Fe nanoparticles supported on strongly (Al2O3, SrTiO3) and weakly (SiO2) interacting substrates. The characterization techniques available for this project are: (i) atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for structural characterization, (ii) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for electronic and chemical characterization, and (iii) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS and XANES) and nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) for structural, thermodynamic and lattice-vibrational characterization. The intellectual merit of this application relies on: (i) the improvement of our current understanding of the thermal properties of metal nanoparticles < 3 nm and (ii) how these characteristics change because of particle size-effects, nanoparticle-adsorbate and nanoparticle-support interactions. This study will contribute insight into the role of the support and its pre-treatment on nanoparticle sintering phenomena, temperature-dependent atomic order-disorder transitions and structural phase transitions involving soft phonon modes. <br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Anomalous thermodynamic properties, such as superheating, negative thermal expansion and ultra-low thermal conductivities, have been reported for nanostructured metals. The origins of these effects are heavily debated. This is due in part to the scientific challenge posed by the complexity of these systems and the need to consider the influence of a number of variables simultaneously, such as the nanoparticle geometry and environment. Through this project, insight into the evolution of important characteristics, such as the melting temperature, thermal expansion coefficient and sintering behavior, of nanoparticles with decreasing size will be sought. A deeper knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of nano-metallic systems may lead to future advances in nanotechnology and materials science, including improving the thermal stability and operation regime of nanoparticles, heat generation and distribution in plasmonic nano-antennae, thermoelectric applications, and nanostructured metal-organic composites for solar cell applications. This project will contribute to the training of PhD and undergraduate students in university and national laboratory settings and will provide the first research experience to two K-12 students. The PI will work with the local Science Center in the organization of an exhibit entitled ""Art in Science, Science in Art,"" intended to draw the attention of the general public to state-of-the-art scientific research in the nanoscience area through visually appealing posters, including microscopy images from the proposed research."

The specific scientific goals are: a) to understand the role played by internal degrees of freedom in the quantum tunneling of magnetization in molecular nanomagnets, and, b) to study the nature of the light-matter interaction in SMMs in the weak and strong coupling regimes, with the goal of achieving quantum coherent control over the molecular spin in view of application in quantum information, molecular spintronics and related emerging technologies. The project goals base on an expansion of pulse EPR spectroscopy extending down to low temperatures (~100mK), achieved with the use of high-sensitivity microstrip resonators (including high quality factor superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators), is expected to enable measurements of decoherence rates with a sensitivity two orders of magnitude smaller than those attained in previous studies. Indeed, the experimental setup resulting from this project allows the investigation of the three primary sources of decoherence, e.g., dipolar, nuclear and vibronic. Diminishing and controlling sources of decoherence in molecular nanomagnets may enable the large number of gate operations demanded by quantum algorithms and quantum error correction protocols. In addition, their intrinsic magnetic molecular anisotropy makes molecular nanomagnets natural systems of interest for the emerging field of molecular spintronics. <br/>The research project is strongly integrated with a series of educational activities designed to train graduate and undergraduate students at the interface between inorganic chemistry and fundamental and applied physics, and exposed to a large, interdisciplinary and international net of collaborations that the PI has established over many years.

0.23478,"The goal of this project is to develop improved models and numerical methods that advance the state of the art for incompressible fluid flow simulation. The key ideas are the better enforcement of geometric and physical laws in the computer algorithms, building a solid mathematical framework for the models and methods developed, and the devising of algorithms that will allow for efficient implementation on supercomputers. Although the simulation of fluid flow is a critical subtask in a wide spectrum of engineering applications, current tools and techniques are often unreliable and it is not uncommon for state of the art methods to take weeks or months (or possibly never finish with an accurate solution), even with thousands of processors, to perform simulations of flows around a car, through a nuclear reactor, or around part of an airplane. The project aims to develop mathematical prediction models and numerical methods that will provide more accurate solutions in a more efficient manner than state-of-the-art methods.<br/><br/>The PIs will construct efficient methods for incompressible flow simulation by constructing models and methods that better adhere to geometric structure and physical conservation laws than modern methods. The key components are to i) construct novel methods that are efficient and can correctly account for vorticity dynamics, and energy, helicity, and mass conservation -- this will require development of efficient boundary conditions and significant analysis to build a solid mathematical framework; ii) develop more efficient algebraic solvers for these methods that can be used on thousands of processors; iii) large scale testing on benchmark problems as well as on application problems with collaborators. Broader impacts include i) developing efficient methods for simulating high speed incompressible flows, which will improve the design process for a wide spectrum of applications in environmental engineering, in cardiovascular simulations, and in atmosphere and ocean sciences; ii) training graduate and undergraduate students through research involvement; and iii) developing large scale, parallel codes to be made publicly available as part of the deal.II library."
1.512856,"There is mounting evidence that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a subnuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale at which Inflation occurred. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor-to-scalar modes, r = T/S. Many theoretically favored models of Inflation produce this ratio between 0.01 and 0.1, corresponding to average amplitude from 30 to 100 nanoKelvins for the resulting CMB B-mode polarization patterns where they peak on scales of degrees. With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and ultimately detecting the CGB polarization signature, which is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. In 2005, the Community Task Force on CMB Research identified a target sensitivity of that ratio equaling to 0.02 as an immediate goal to detect the Inflationary gravitational waves imprint in the CMB polarization that pertain to the standard cosmological model. The newly installed 'Small Polarimeter Upgrades for DASI' (SPUD) reconfigured a five- receivers telescope to the ""South Pole Inflationary Cosmology Experiment"" (SPICE) that will: (a) Complete the CGB search in CMB B-mode polarization at 150 GHz, reaching depths which based on current sensitivity performance, that will detect the Inflationary CGB for r > 0.02; (b) Prove that this signal is cosmic in origin while separately measuring the Galactic foreground contamination at its minimum; (c) Detect gravitational lensing of CMB polarization on scales of ~1 degree, probing the CGB to the lensing confusion limit for degree-scale observations (r < 0.01) if the energy scale of Inflation is low; and (d) Surpass the instrumental sensitivity goals set forth for 2013 by the 2005 CMB Task Force recommendations. Detection of the CGB waves would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang theory. Indeed, its impact may be even broader as nuclear physics had matured enough prior to the establishment of the ""hot"" Big Bang model, while Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics: the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics, string theory, and the highest accessible energies. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science and train students."

0.145846,"Sri Lanka is renowned for its diverse and unique flora, with nearly 30% of flowering plant species found nowhere else. Most of this plant diversity is concentrated in the highlands in the south of the island. The flora of Sri Lanka is assumed to have a close affinity to the flora of the Western Ghats, and together these two regions comprise a recognized global biodiversity hotspot. This project will investigate species diversity within the plant genus Polyspora (Theaceae), a relative of tea, and use the group as a model to examine plant diversification within the Sri Lanka-Western Ghats region. This study will clarify the number of recognized species of Polyspora in Sri Lanka and map their patterns of distribution within the region. Comparative methods will be used to estimate when Sri Lankan Polyspora species diversified in the past, how their patterns of distribution have changed through time, and how their patterns of distribution are predicted to change in the future. This project will strengthen international collaborations among researchers from the US, Sri Lanka and India, and will increase participation in science of students from underrepresented groups in the USA. <br/><br/>A species level phylogeny of the genus Polyspora using plastid and nuclear DNA sequences will be reconstructed and used to examine biogeographic relationships between both Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats, and within South Asia in general. Identification of the sister group and divergence time of the Sri Lankan Polyspora lineage will provide a context for diversification within Sri Lanka and address longstanding questions on the number, delimitation, and geographic distribution of genera in Thecae that will provide a framework for future floristic and taxonomic work in the family. A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis of 120 Polyspora accessions will be used to provide a fine-scale test of geographic structure within Sri Lanka.

0.395881,"This award is to study the variation in biomechanical properties of individual healthy and cancerous cells and to relate these properties to the underlying gene expression of important structural, regulatory, and invasive features of the cell. The project will use a new cell sorting device to divide healthy and cancerous cells into softer and stiffer groups. Important biological properties of the cells that predict how they could spread in the body and make new tumors will be measured and compared between the softer and stiffer cell groups. Finally the project will develop a computer model of the cell to explain how differences in which genes are active cause them to be stiff or soft. Knowledge of the biomechanical variation of cancer cells may improve the understanding of cancer metastasis and create a new predictor of a cancer?s spread. This project will provide training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students on cell mechanics, microfabrication, and cancer biology. The research activities will also promote the recruitment and mentoring of students in cutting-edge scientific techniques through outreach in the Atlanta public high schools.<br/><br/>The mechanical integrity of cells is regulated by a dynamic network of structural, cross-linking, and signaling molecules. Therefore, alterations of the mechanical properties of individual cells can reveal important insights into changes in these molecular networks. For example, invasive tumor cells typically soften mechanically, which thereby enhance their capacity to escape from a primary tumor. However, the mechanical variation within a given cell type can be substantial, which not only limits the specificity of cell mechanical measurements, but also poses an intriguing and unanswered question: why do cell mechanical properties vary between similar cells? The objective of this research is to understand how variations in gene expression can lead to variations of cellular mechanics between populations of cells as well as within populations of cells. This study will examine the correlation between cellular mechanical properties (modulus, viscous relaxation, and size) and gene expression, on a cell by cell basis. Two unique experimental measurements will be conducted. First, individual cells will be measured biomechanically with atomic force microscopy and subsequently analyzed for gene expression of mechanically relevant genes previously identified to be differentially expressed from population studies of ovarian healthy and cancer cells. Second, a biophysical cell sorting device will be used to obtain cells of stiffer and softer phenotypes. Each sorted group of cells will be examined for functional and gene expression differences. Finally, the experimental results will be used to inform a multiscale computational model of the cell to explain how biological variation (e.g. crosslinking density) can lead to biophysical variation. The study will delineate the fundamental aspects of the mechanical properties of living cells, particularly cytoskeleton crosslinking, nuclear membrane, and micromechanical changes due to dynamical processes on short time scales (e.g. cell cycle) and longer time scales (e.g. epithelial to mesenchymal transition). This project will answer questions such as whether softer subtypes of noninvasive cells can nonetheless show metastatic-like migration. Knowledge of the biophysics of metastasis of ovarian cancer cells may lead to new diagnostic and treatment approaches based upon detecting and inhibiting specific cell biophysical phenotypes. The project will continue the educational and outreach efforts to increase the number of students pursuing science and engineering. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in solving interdisciplinary problems by using state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods."

0.39,"The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism B (CSDM-B) program supports Professor Michael R. Wasielewski of Northwestern University to carry out fundamental studies on controlling the spin dynamics of complex multi-spin molecular systems that target spintronics and quantum information processing. Fast photo-initiated electron transfer within covalently-linked organic donor-acceptor molecules having specific donor-acceptor (D-A) distances and orientations results in the formation of spin-entangled electron-hole pairs (i.e. spin-correlated radical ion pairs, SCRPs) having well-defined initial spin configurations and magnetic spin-spin interactions. The project focuses on the demanding task of controlling spin coherence within organic molecular arrays using SCRPs in tailored covalent structures. The specific goals are to investigate: 1) What is the scope of spin coherence transfer by optical excitation of an SCRP? 2) What factors determine coherence dephasing in SCRPs? 3) Can coherent spin states be transported (""teleported"") over long distances using SCRPs? 4) Can nuclear spins be used to store and retrieve coherent electron spin states produced by an SCRP? <br/><br/>Developing a fundamental understanding of how to control charge and spin transport through organized arrays of organic molecules is critical to the development of new electronics and spintronics especially with regard to their potential impact on computers and information processing.

0.155138,"The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest existing ice shelf in Antarctica, and is currently stabilizing significant portions of the land ice atop the Antarctic continent. An ice shelf begins where the land ice goes afloat on the ocean, and as such, the Ross Ice Shelf interacts with the ocean and seafloor below, and the land ice behind. Currently, the Ross Ice Shelf slows down, or buttresses, the fast flowing ice streams of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), a marine-based ice sheet, which if melted, would raise global sea level by 3-4 meters. The Ross Ice Shelf average ice thickness is approximately 350 meters, and it covers approximately 487,000 square kilometers, an area slightly larger than the state of California. The Ross Ice Shelf has disappeared during prior interglacial periods, suggesting in the future it may disappear again. Understanding the dynamics, stability and future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet therefore requires in-depth knowledge of the Ross Ice Shelf. The ROSETTA-ICE project brings together scientists from 4 US institutions and from the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences Limited, known as GNS Science, New Zealand. The ROSETTA-ICE data on the ice shelf, the water beneath the ice shelf, and the underlying rocks, will allow better predictions of how the Ross Ice Shelf will respond to changing climate, and therefore how the WAIS will behave in the future. The interdisciplinary ROSETTA-ICE team will train undergraduate and high school students in cutting edge research techniques, and will also work to educate the public via a series of vignettes integrating ROSETTA-ICE science with the scientific and human history of Antarctic research.<br/><br/>The ROSETTA-ICE survey will acquire gravity and magnetics data to determine the water depth beneath the ice shelf. Radar, LIDAR and imagery systems will be used to map the Ross Ice Shelf thickness and fine structure, crevasses, channels, debris, surface accumulation and distribution of marine ice. The high resolution aerogeophysical data over the Ross Ice Shelf region in Antarctica will be acquired using the IcePod sensor suite mounted externally on an LC-130 aircraft operating from McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Field activities will include ~36 flights on LC-130 aircraft over two field seasons in Antarctica. The IcePod instrument suite leverages the unique experience of the New York Air National Guard operating in Antarctica for NSF scientific research as well as infrastructure and logistics. The project will answer questions about the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf in future climate, and the geotectonic evolution of the Ross Ice Shelf Region, a key component of the West Antarctic Rift system. The comprehensive benchmark data sets acquired will enable broad, interdisciplinary analyses and modeling, which will also be performed as part of the project. ROSETTA-ICE will illuminate Ross ice sheet-ice shelf-ocean dynamics as the system nears a critical juncture but still is intact.

0.080786,"The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest existing ice shelf in Antarctica, and is currently stabilizing significant portions of the land ice atop the Antarctic continent. An ice shelf begins where the land ice goes afloat on the ocean, and as such, the Ross Ice Shelf interacts with the ocean and seafloor below, and the land ice behind. Currently, the Ross Ice Shelf slows down, or buttresses, the fast flowing ice streams of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), a marine-based ice sheet, which if melted, would raise global sea level by 3-4 meters. The Ross Ice Shelf average ice thickness is approximately 350 meters, and it covers approximately 487,000 square kilometers, an area slightly larger than the state of California. The Ross Ice Shelf has disappeared during prior interglacial periods, suggesting in the future it may disappear again. Understanding the dynamics, stability and future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet therefore requires in-depth knowledge of the Ross Ice Shelf. The ROSETTA-ICE project brings together scientists from 4 US institutions and from the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences Limited, known as GNS Science, New Zealand. The ROSETTA-ICE data on the ice shelf, the water beneath the ice shelf, and the underlying rocks, will allow better predictions of how the Ross Ice Shelf will respond to changing climate, and therefore how the WAIS will behave in the future. The interdisciplinary ROSETTA-ICE team will train undergraduate and high school students in cutting edge research techniques, and will also work to educate the public via a series of vignettes integrating ROSETTA-ICE science with the scientific and human history of Antarctic research.<br/><br/>The ROSETTA-ICE survey will acquire gravity and magnetics data to determine the water depth beneath the ice shelf. Radar, LIDAR and imagery systems will be used to map the Ross Ice Shelf thickness and fine structure, crevasses, channels, debris, surface accumulation and distribution of marine ice. The high resolution aerogeophysical data over the Ross Ice Shelf region in Antarctica will be acquired using the IcePod sensor suite mounted externally on an LC-130 aircraft operating from McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Field activities will include ~36 flights on LC-130 aircraft over two field seasons in Antarctica. The IcePod instrument suite leverages the unique experience of the New York Air National Guard operating in Antarctica for NSF scientific research as well as infrastructure and logistics. The project will answer questions about the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf in future climate, and the geotectonic evolution of the Ross Ice Shelf Region, a key component of the West Antarctic Rift system. The comprehensive benchmark data sets acquired will enable broad, interdisciplinary analyses and modeling, which will also be performed as part of the project.

0.403115,"A major difficulty in experimental studies of protein folding is the inability to probe local structure and dynamics at the level of an individual residue in a non-perturbing fashion. Genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) significantly enhances the ability to study local environments of large proteins, since defined spectroscopic labels can be incorporated site-specifically into proteins in vivo. The research goal of this proposal is the synthesis, characterization, and application of isotopically labeled UAAs, such as isotopic variants of 4-cyano-L-phenylalanine and 4-ethynyl-L-phenylalanine, to serve as sensitive spectroscopic probes of protein structure and dynamics with site-specificity in a relatively non-perturbing fashion. These UAAs will be paired with infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and/or fluorescence spectroscopy to examine different local protein environments present in several protein systems including the dematin headpiece subdomain (DHP) and superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP).<br/><br/>The educational goal of this proposal is the integration of the proposed research into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Franklin & Marshall College and to mentor undergraduate research students investigating protein structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics. Aspects of the proposed research will be incorporated into both the general chemistry and physical chemistry courses. For instance, the ability to probe protein structure and unfolding with a variety of spectroscopic techniques will be explored in the Physical Chemistry 1 (Thermodynamics and Kinetics) course. At least ten undergraduate students will be involved in the research. Undergraduate research provides the opportunity for personalized teaching that greatly aids the intellectual development of the students. The training of undergraduate research students will position them for success in their future endeavors such as graduate school, medical school, or other career paths."

The focus of the REU program is to convey to the student participants the full range of activities involved in the research process. The core of the program's activities consists of a 10-week research project under the supervision of a UCLA faculty member.

0.085575,"We will quantify the black carbon contents at six sites of the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network in an effort to understand the landscape-level distribution of black carbon in different environments reaching from Alaska to Florida. In addition, we will measure black carbon contents in a large number of samples collected by the United States Geological Survey in a 40-kilometer grid and generate a map of its distribution for several regions in the United States. This information will be fed into a data base for the National Soil Carbon Network (http://www.fluxdata.org/nscn/SitePages/Home.aspx) to develop a learning tool for assessing soil carbon changes. The data obtained by hydropyrolysis will be compared with those obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and UV-oxidation procedures. We will develop a conversion tool to calculate black carbon contents using mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy that is the most rapid tool to quantify carbon forms in soil. <br/><br/>During forest and savanna fires, large quantities of char may be produced and this so-called black carbon is found to be ubiquitous. Whether this material accumulates in soil or is exported by erosion, leaching or decomposition, is largely unknown. Black carbon itself is very recalcitrant and may also constitute a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. A better knowledge of the global distribution of black carbon will help answer several important questions about the global carbon cycles, about the relevance of black carbon in soil productivity and in which way soil organic matter will change with warming as a result of climate change or with cultivation as a result of land use changes. Several methods are available for measurement of soil black carbon content, but most of them only measure part of the continuum of chemical substances that make up black carbon. Hydropyrolysis offers the potential for an inexpensive and rapid analysis method with the same accuracy as the best currently available methodology, and would therefore make a large number of analyses possible. The ability to quantify isotopes through the separation procedure in hydropyrolysis affords the opportunity to quantify turnover times. The versatility of this analytical tool will aid in refining quantification and separation to accommodate different research objectives by recognizing that black carbon is a continuum of carbon forms."
0.316711,"1264874 Sholl<br/><br/>Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are at an emerging stage in their development as a large class of nanoporous materials for new applications especially in separations and catalysis. The central theme of this project is to create a systematic computational and experimental framework for understanding the interactions of MOF materials with hydrogen-bonding (polar) molecules. The PIs propose a synergistic experimental and modeling effort to quantitatively measure the adsorption and diffusion properties of water and alcohols (methanol and ethanol) in MOFs. Molecular adsorption and diffusion will be measured directly using state-of-the-art vapor phase gravimetry and high-gradient-strength pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) methods with a series of MOFs chosen to systematically vary pore size and functionality. These measurements will significantly expand the scope of quantitative experimental information that is available about hydrogen-bonding molecule transport and adsorption in MOFs. By directly comparing our experimental results with a careful series of molecular simulations, the PIs expect to understand the key features of hydrogen-bonded adsorption and diffusion in MOFs and assess the capability of force fields for describing such species. In addition to extensive proposed work with established MOFs, the PIs will also study the performance of hybrid zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIFs), a class of MOF materials developed recently at Georgia Tech. Hybrid ZIFs can be made with continuously tunable pore characteristics and create new opportunities for optimizing material performance in separations. The PIs will examine the possibility of using this fine tuning property to develop high performance membranes for water-alcohol separations.<br/>Broader Impacts. The emergence of a rational framework for evaluating MOFs in liquid-phase separations will have long-term impact in the pursuit of applications for MOFs in biofuel processing and biorefinery operations. A nearer-term technological impact could be in the successful selection and use of robust MOFs/ZIFs to create high-performance membranes for water-alcohol separations relevant in biofuel processing. At a more fundamental level, this work will advance the shared goals of the separations, porous materials, and computational chemical engineering communities in overcoming basic challenges inherent in high-throughput discovery of advanced materials for separations. This works is potentially transformative in helping to enhance the role of porous materials in chemical separations through rational design methods. The PIs will pursue these desired impacts by creating a positive and measurable impact on the careers of young and prospective engineers and scientists. The PIs will mentor a diverse group of 6-8 researchers at graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels via carefully designed and assessed learning experiences over periods of 1-3 years. This will encompass PhD thesis projects, undergraduate research projects, and extended high-school student internships in collaboration with a STEM-focused charter school. The transfer of research findings into the PIs? elective courses on nanoscale chemical engineering and molecular modeling will have a significant educational impact."
0.5,"Electric motors and generators, or more generally ""electric machines,"" are a fundamental building block of modern society. Over 99% of all the electricity on the planet originates from an electric generator regardless of how it is spun (wind, coal, nuclear, etc.) and roughly 2/3 of that energy goes on to power electric motors. There is a worldwide market of $73.2 billion annually for electric machines. As electric energy consumption steadily increases annually, these ubiquitous workhorses continue to be mass-produced for performing the pumping, heating, cooling, drilling, pressing, cutting, grinding, and moving that occurs every minute of every day. Traditional electric motors rely on magnetism to function, and are made of steel, copper wire windings, and permanent magnets. These materials are mostly sourced from abroad, especially copper for the windings and rare earth elements for the magnets. These elements are expensive and have a volatile market. This project focuses on overcoming technical barriers in order to create motors that use electric fields, rather than magnetism, to operate. Electric fields would allow other materials, e.g. aluminum and plastic, to be used which are lighter weight and lower cost than materials for magnetism based motors. These materials could be domestically sourced, in addition to being more easily recycled. <br/><br/>The educational aspects of the project are focused on increasing the scientific and engineering literacy of pre-college and college students as well as the general public. Hands-on science and engineering demonstrations for pre-college students will stimulate STEM education and entice students to pursue STEM fields in their careers. College courses will be reworked to allow students to gain skills as effective researchers. Science Cafs held for the general public will serve as grass roots discussions on relevant energy science and engineering topics to increase science literacy in the general public. <br/><br/>Motors utilizing an electric field as the torque-producing mechanism (E-field Motors) can have significant materials, manufacturing, and operational advantages over their magnetic counterparts. To realize the potential of E-field machines the project will develop analytical E-field machine models encompassing electrostatics, fluid mechanics, and dielectric materials to form a multiphysics analytical model/methodology for E-field machine development. These models will be applied to reduce the mechanical gap between rotors and stators of the E-field motor via hydrodynamic bearing action with a dielectric fluid. The gap reduction will drive up the operational electric field and electrostatic shear stress simultaneously. This approach will be validated by multiphysics finite element simulations, bench scale experiments and E-field machine prototypes based on the multiphysics analytical design. Performance of the prototypes will be compared to traditional magnetism based motor designs. By exceeding the performance of magnetic motors, the project will transform the life cycle of electric motors by making them more recyclable through reducing the raw materials they require. Since E-field systems use electric fields to produce torque, rare earth magnets and silicon steel would no longer be required, and copper could be be replaced with aluminum."
0.468634,"This award will support an ambitious high time resolution survey of the entire sky visible with the Green Bank Telescope. The primary science driver for this experiment is to discover millisecond pulsars to add to the NANOGrav (North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves) pulsar timing array for gravitational wave detection. The survey will also discover exotic binary systems, transient pulsars, and other classes of transient sources. Roughly 20% of the sky has already been covered in the first phase of this survey, with 11 new pulsars discovered through processing 5% of these data. Simulations suggest that the full survey will discover 50?100 millisecond pulsars and about 200 normal pulsars.<br/><br/>The direct detection of gravitational waves is one of the foremost goals of modern physics and may offer unique insights into galaxy formation, the early stages of the universe, and even cosmic strings. Finding new, high-precision millisecond pulsars to add to pulsar timing arrays will facilitate the principal goals of this project. The survey will likely detect pulsars in exotic binary systems which will provide tests of general relativity and probe extreme density nuclear physics. The survey will be sensitive to transient signals that will permit exploration of the full range of pulsar intermittency and discover completely new astrophysical phenomena. Furthermore, all of the new pulsars discovered will be useful for improving our understanding of the properties of the nearby, local pulsar population. With support from this award, this group will create undergraduate fellowship programs at West Virginia University and the University of Virginia that will allow students to participate in survey observations, processing, and follow-up. These programs are expected to increase retention of students in science and engineering majors and offer both undergraduate and graduate students peer-mentoring opportunities."
0.489996,"Currently, the high-performance computing (HPC) community is focused on achieving exaflop performance, which is about a 30-fold improvement from the performance of the best supercomputer in the world today. Because of practical, financial, and environmental concerns, the Department of Energy is setting a power limit for achieving an exaflop at 20 megawatts. As today's top machines generally consume between five and 20 megawatts---and yet are an order of magnitude or more away from the exaflop performance target, significant hardware and software advances in HPC systems are necessary. One way to improve hardware is to use overprovisioned systems, which contain more machines than can be fully powered simultaneously. While overprovisioned systems have the potential to significantly improve power and performance, software will need to be redesigned to support such systems.<br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is to design and implement software infrastructure that will support overprovisioned systems. The key advance in the infrastructure is support of system-wide optimizations, i.e., optimizations that span multiple applications. This is in stark contrast to the current focus in HPC systems of optimizing on a per-application basis. The developed software will consist of a job profiler, a scheduler that performs analysis on multiple jobs at a time, and a cluster-wide run-time system that jointly optimizes multiple applications based on the output of the scheduler analysis.<br/><br/>Achieving exascale computing is an important national priority and will impact many critical application domains, such as climate/weather, renewable energy, nuclear energy, materials science, and national security. The work described here will improve whole-system performance on power-constrained HPC systems, which is one important step towards the exascale goal. The project plans to transfer technology resulting from this research in the form of the proposed software stack via longstanding collaborations with several national laboratories."
0.159185,"In this project, Professors David Rovnyak and Timothy Strein of Bucknell University are funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, to conduct a wide ranging study of bile acid aggregation using multiple techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fluorescence and electrophoresis. Bile acids are cholesterol-derived amphiphilic molecules in the liver which facilitate lipid and cholesterol transport. Predominant in aqueous solution as their salts (a.k.a. bile salts), fundamental physico-chemical properties of these important molecules are not well understood. Indeed it has been difficult to achieve consensus on bile aggregation, namely, the intermolecular interactions and dynamics that give rise to properties such as critical micelle concentration(s), aggregation number(s), gel formation, and guest-host interactions, beyond Small's model of bile aggregation proposed ca. 1968. Also, the capacity of bile aggregates to differentially solubilize the enantiomers of certain chiral compounds has not been characterized at a molecular level. This project will use the various techniques to detect and validate behaviors that have the potential to help explain seemingly disparate reports in the literature. For example, preliminary work has shown that NMR methods unambiguously delineate separate early and primary micellization stages that have not been clearly observed before. Further, planar fluorescent probes that exhibit strong solvatochromism are used to detect and characterize the presence of hydrophobic regions of the bile micelles. Micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis will be used as a sensitive probe of aggregation stages and of guest-host interactions. Through the use of these complementary techniques, we a better understanding of the complicated intermolecular chemistry of bile salts will emerge. <br/><br/>Bile acids are fascinating naturally produced molecules whose complex properties have challenged scientists for decades. Bile acids can interact strongly with certain classes of oils, form gels with desirable properties such as the capacity to promote topical drug delivery, and most recently are being found to play much wider roles in the maintenance of human health than previously understood. Bile acids can also help distinguish among isomers of compounds that would be difficult to separate by other means. Yet there is a need to explain bile acid properties and behaviors on the molecular scale. With deeper insights into the molecular scale behaviors of bile acids, there is the possibility to tap into greater potential for new applications of bile acids, and for better understanding of their broader roles in human biology. The undergraduate students working on these projects will be involved in all aspects of this project. They will acquire hands-on experience in the design of multifaceted experiments, the use of sophisticated spectroscopic instrumentation, and in analyzing and interpreting data collected using those instruments. This experience provides students preparation for further study or future employment."

About 98% of all stars - including our Sun - will end their lives as white dwarfs. The proposal team consists of senior researchers at three institutions, and they have a vast combined experience in observational studies of white dwarfs. Their study of these stars will provide critical insights about the history of the Milky Way galaxy. The project to measure the properties of all white dwarf stars in our solar neighborhood will produce results that are of fundamental importance in several areas of stellar astrophysics. They will also enhance the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs, which has been a primary resource for the astronomical community (both professional and amateur) for four decades. PI Holberg has authored a popular science book and is working on two more, including one about White Dwarfs. CoPI Oswalt will share results from this program as an American Astronomical Society Shapley Visiting Lecturer. This award will provide training opportunities for a University of Arizona graduate student and for undergraduate students from Villanova University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.<br/><br/>The proposal team will compile and characterize a volume-limited sample of the local white dwarf population within 50 parsecs. This will increase the number of well-studied, nearby white dwarfs by an order of magnitude, and it will enable us to address questions such as the relative distribution of different white dwarf types, the binary fraction of white dwarfs, the local mass distribution and chemical evolution of the galaxy, white dwarf spectral evolution, and many others. It will also provide a reference sample for the vast numbers of more distant white dwarfs likely to be discovered with future survey missions like Gaia and LSST.

Herzog, Leonardo Rastelli, Martin Rocek, Robert Shrock, Warren Siegel and George Sterman at Stony Brook University.<br/><br/>These research activities span a wide range of topics in theoretical physics, largely based on quantum field theory and string theory. Recent years have seen a renaissance of engagement between theory and experiment in particle physics, with new and exciting data from the Large Hadron Collider, from neutrino observatories and from cosmic ray satellites. These new sources of information about our universe enable theorists to test long-standing ideas against evolving data, and to develop new theoretical methods to guide experiment. At the same time, novel applications of quantum field and string theory have been developed in and beyond particle physics, opening unexpected avenues of research into nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum information, sometimes with applications in pure mathematics. As active participants in these historic developments, the senior personnel of this award will continue and develop their work in high energy collider physics, neutrino and astroparticle physics, applications of gauge-gravity duality, extensions of the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking, leptogenesis, superstrings, the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories, and the theory of the strong interactions. <br/><br/>By advancing our knowledge of the laws of nature and by contributing to a better understanding of the physical universe, this research has significant broader impacts and implications for our world view. Indeed, many of the topics under study by the senior participants are frequently discussed in the media, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson, the role of neutrinos in the Universe, string theory and the quark-gluon plasma. The research outlined in this proposal will also serve in the training of graduate students and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows. The faculty on this proposal conduct their research with graduate students, and share their experience and expertise with undergraduates and community members, in and beyond the classroom."
0.186211,"The project aims to find a powerful new route towards exfoliated clay/polymer nanocomposites at high clay loading. A recently discovered self-organizing process is able to disintegrate (exfoliate) clay particles into their individual thin sheets (leaves) when being gently mixed into a suitable polymer. The phenomenon is called self-exfoliation, since no external energy input is required. In the resulting nanocomposite, the clay leaves were found to distribute uniformly throughout the polymer matrix (i.e., random leaves), which can be beneficial for many applications that require high connectivity (mechanical, electrical, and thermal). While such self-exfoliation has great potential as a novel nanocomposite synthesis process, it has not yet been applied due to the lack of a better understanding of the self-exfoliation mechanism. <br/><br/>The planned research has the objective of explaining the origins of the self-exfoliation so that it can be utilized systematically as a new path for creating novel polymer nanocomposites at high loadings of random leaves including graphene. The synergistic expertise of the PI and co-PI will allow a full characterization of the nanocomposite formation. Diverse experimental methods will probe the four relevant length scales of this system. The macro-scale bulk properties and their mechanical evolution during exfoliation, which are most relevant industrially, will be studied through rheology. Rheology will also provide the time scales of the exfoliation dynamics and will guide the other experiments in this way. The micron-scale will be probed with optical microscopy to observe aggregate swelling and the homogeneity and randomness of the final exfoliated state. The nano-scale structure/dynamics will be observed with SAXS (small angle x-ray scattering), USAXS (ultra-SAXS), and SANS (small angle neutron scattering) to monitor clay gallery spacing and a polymer conformation anchored to a clay leaf, and AFM (atomic force microscopy) to test for the presence of an entropic-pulling force from the tethered polymer chains. The bonding at the atomic scale will be probed with NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy to confirm the presence of hydrogen bonds and determine if hydrogen bonds form on the face and/or sides of a clay leaf. The initial part of the research will be guided by hypothesizing two possible self-exfoliation mechanisms and by following up with experiments on several different self-exfoliating clay/polymer systems. <br/><br/>Based on these research findings, other self-exfoliating material combinations (graphene instead of clay; semicrystalline polymers instead of amorphous polymers) and their processing conditions will be explored. Research results from the two research groups will feed into each other and lead to a broad education of graduate and undergraduate students of the two research groups. This includes the co-PI's SAXS/WAXS beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source, which will provide undergraduate/graduate students with an unusually broad perspective on scientific research."
0.781263,"This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics--Experiment Program in the Physics (PHY) Division in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics--Theory Program in PHY/MPS, and the Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology--Theory Program in PHY/MPS, and the Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology Program in the Astronomy (AST) Division of MPS, and the Science, Technology, and Society Program in the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE), and the Division of Graduate Education (DGE) in the Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR),and the Office of Integrative Activities and the Office of International Science and Engineering. For nearly a century, physicists have used quantum mechanics to understand many properties of the physical world, from the behavior of atoms and molecules to the nuclear forces that govern sub-atomic particles. Predictions from the theory have matched experimental observations to impeccable accuracy. Conceptually, however, the theory includes some strikingly strange features. Among the most curious is known as ""quantum entanglement."" According to quantum mechanics, particles that have been prepared in a special way can retain a connection, even after they have moved arbitrarily far apart from each other--a property which Albert Einstein dubbed ""spooky actions at a distance."" Nowadays entanglement is at the heart of many cutting-edge technologies, including quantum encryption and quantum computing. Yet every experimental test of quantum entanglement to date has been subject to various loopholes: alternative explanations, different than quantum theory, that might account for the long-distance correlations in the particles' behavior. In this project, the principal investigators aim to address the most stubborn, and least studied, of these loopholes, known as the ""setting independence loophole."" To shield against any unintended coordination between the particles and the measurement apparatus--coordination that could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics--the selection of which properties of the particles to be measured will be determined by real-time observation of some of the oldest light in our universe: light that was emitted from astronomical objects so far away from Earth and from each other that neither object would have been able to receive any signals from each other prior to the moment they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. The new series of experiments will thus test entanglement on an entirely new scale. If, as expected, the results match the predictions from quantum mechanics, then any alternatives will be ruled out or severely constrained, and new technologies such as quantum encryption will be placed on the strongest possible footing. If, on the other hand, the experiment finds novel departures from predictions, that could point toward profoundly new physics. This project also has an informal education component that will take place through exhibits and programs at the MIT Museum; these will connect the public to the experiment as it evolves in real time, and will be evaluated and widely disseminated. <br/><br/>Experimental tests of Bell's inequality have been subject to several loopholes which hold out the possibility, however slim, that individual particles could possess simultaneously sharp values for noncommuting variables. Such behavior would be at odds with quantum mechanics, and would subject quantum-encryption protocols to new vulnerabilities. The most subtle loophole is known as ""setting independence."" In any test of entanglement, one must select detector settings on each side of the experimental apparatus, choosing to measure, for example, a particle's spin along the x-axis, the y-axis, or some intermediate angle. The usual assumption is that no third party, acting in the shared causal past of the entangled particles and the measurement apparatus, has affected the joint probability distribution for detector settings. Yet even a tiny coordination among detector settings and the entangled particles could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics. In this series of experiments, the principal investigators aim to address the setting-independence loophole using real-time observations of distant astronomical sources, such as quasars--sources that were causally isolated from each other and from the worldline of the Earth at the time they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. Any non-quantum-mechanical coordination among elements of the experiment would thereby be pushed back billions of years, in some scenarios back to the big bang itself, an improvement of 20 orders of magnitude over current constraints."
0.45,"Non-technical Abstract:<br/>Robots have the potential for wide-ranging positive impacts on society in complex or dangerous applications such as disaster relief, elder care and the reshoring of manufacturing jobs. However, existing robots have had limited success is these domains, mainly because the planning and control algorithms are not robust to misconceptions in the robot's ""understanding"" of its environment nor to small imperfections in the robot's ability to execute the required actions. The overall goal of this project is to develop the sensing, planning, and control algorithms necessary to overcome these problems, and hence necessary to allow robots to work productively in complex domains shared with humans.<br/><br/>The key activities of this project are the development of new ways of representing uncertainty in the state of the world that support efficient planning for robots. These new representations and algorithms provide principled and practical methods of integrating perception and action in complex domains. The resulting algorithms are tested in the context of a real robot performing household tasks in a kitchen environment.<br/><br/>The project also involves a thorough integration of research and education. Graduate and undergraduate students are involved in all aspects of the research. Furthermore, the research in this project forms the basis of an undergraduate subject on robot planning algorithms under development at MIT.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop the estimation, planning, and control techniques necessary to enable robots to perform robustly and intelligently in complex uncertain domains. Robots operating in complex, unknown environments have to deal explicitly with uncertainty. Sensing is increasingly reliable, but still inescapably local: robots cannot see, immediately, inside cupboards, under collapsed walls, or into nuclear containment vessels. Planning, whether in household and disaster-relief domains, requires explicit consideration of uncertainty and the selection of actions at both the task and motion levels to support gathering information.<br/><br/>In order to explicitly consider the effects of uncertainty and to generate actions that gain information, it is necessary to plan in belief space: that is, the space of the robot's beliefs about the state of its environment, which we will represent as probability distributions over states of the environment. For planning purposes, the initial state is a belief state and the goal is a set of belief states: for example, a goal might be for the robot to believe with probability greater than 0.99 that all of the groceries are put away in acceptable locations, or that there are no survivors remaining in the rubble.<br/><br/>This project is developing a systematic, integrated approach to finding plans efficiently in high-dimensional uncertain domains. By factoring the belief space and exploiting a decoupling between geometric and probabilistic reasoning, this approach can employ constraint satisfaction methods to generate good solutions relatively efficiently. This program of basic research provides conceptual, formal, algorithmic, and software results that are of use in mobile manipulation robotics, as well as artificial intelligence more generally, including applications from medical diagnosis and treatment to electronic commerce to managing energy production and distribution systems."

The new microscope provides advanced technical capabilities to USU's researchers that currently are not available at the institution. <br/><br/>The acquisition of the microscope will provide a transformative improvement in the materials characterization infrastructure at USU, increase the quality and productivity of faculty research, and directly impact funded research in processing and manufacturing of biomaterials, nanomaterials, and energy materials for a number of researchers. Specifically, the enabled research includes characterizing nanoparticles for antimicrobial applications and biofuel production, bioplastics, and food microstructures; nanoscale-composition analysis for nanotubes, nanowires, nanoporous materials, nuclear materials, and charging effects in insulators; and microscale-composition analysis for geothermal and earthquake studies, soil, and leaf morphology correlated to climate. Overall, the equipment will be integrated into the USU Microscopy Core Facility that serves the research needs of faculty from at least six departments in three colleges of the university. The microscope also will be used extensively for educational outreach and training at USU and will be integrated into a new course on electron microscopy to help train students using the new microscope. Approximately 60 graduate and undergraduate students are expected to utilize this microscope in their research. Additionally, the microscope's remote operations will allow the microscope to be used for classes and research at USU branch campuses across the state of Utah. Additionally, K-12 students visiting the USU campus will take advantage of the unique capabilities of the instruments during visits to the university."
0.33,"Fluid-structure interaction is ubiquitous across a range of engineering applications, from flutter and divergence in aerodynamics, to vibration of fuel rods in nuclear power reactors, tension legs in offshore platforms, wind turbine towers, and hydrokinetic energy harvesting. A major aim of this work is to demonstrate that using intentionally designed nonlinear oscillators inside a bluff body it is possible to passively suppress vortex induced vibrations - VIVs, partially stabilize the wake past the body, and reduce the drag force exerted by the surrounding fluid without any external modification. This research can have broad and significant impact in diverse fields. For example, the reduction of the drag forces on a bluff body through the action of internal nonlinear oscillators might significantly affect the design of future air vehicles and boats by enhancing their performance, enlarging their range of operation and decreasing fuel consumption. Also, enhanced and economical hydrodynamic vibration energy harvesting could be achieved by appropriate design and optimization of internal nonlinear oscillators inside a body undergoing VIVs.<br/><br/>In this research, the dynamic interactions of a strongly nonlinear finite-dimensional oscillator with an infinite-dimensional fluid flow will be studied. This is important in understanding not only fluid-structure interaction in a variety of contexts, but also, in a broader sense, because it serves as a testbed for understanding the nonlinear dynamical behavior of a variety of other mechanical (and nonmechanical) systems involving nonlinear interactions of coupled finite- and infinite-dimensional parts. The fundamental importance of dealing with an intermediate-to-high range of Reynolds number -- Re -- lies in the fact that our preliminary results show that the dimension of the attractor in the two-dimensional laminar case is less than four, while in the turbulent case, it is expected to grow as Re to the 9/4 power. This system thus provides a unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of fluid-structure interaction, where the dimension of the attractor varies from one (for periodic response) to much larger values. We will also study the heretofore unexplored role of angular momentum in VIV. Finally, the capacity of strongly nonlinear internal oscillating elements to drastically modify the wake of a bluff body and reduce its drag coefficient at both intermediate and higher Re will be explored. The research will be performed using slow/fast dynamical decompositions, invariant slow manifold considerations, nonlinear system identification, and reduced-order modeling techniques. High-fidelity fluid-structure interaction computations will be performed in the laminar, transition, and turbulent regimes."
1.32,"This award funds the research activities of Professors David Gross, Joseph Polchinski, Mark Srednicki, Robert Sugar, and Anthony Zee at the University of California at Santa Barbara.<br/><br/>This award will support research aimed at understanding the basic building blocks of matter and the fundamental laws underlying nature by a variety of approaches: theoretical, computational, and by building models of the properties of elementary particles. Gross and Polchinski are largely focused on the construction of a unified theory of gravity and the particle interactions, based on string theory and related ideas. Particular approaches are the study of the quantum mechanical properties of black holes, the emergence of space-time from a more fundamental theory, and the understanding of higher symmetries that appear in these theories. Sugar studies the properties of the strong nuclear interaction using large-scale computation, directed at testing the existing Standard Model of particle properties and the search for new physics. Srednicki and Zee study models of known and new particles, including neutrinos, supersymmetric particles, and dark matter. These are all areas where a host of experiments will continue to report new results, from the LHC and Fermilab to a variety of deep-mine and space-based observations. The members of the group are broad in their interests and work on other areas as well, including nonequilibrium dynamics, quantum chaos and its connections with mathematics and physics, new methods and applications in quantum field theory (the basic mathematical framework for quantum physics), and the understanding of the cosmological constant, which drives the accelerating expansion of the universe.<br/><br/>The training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows is a major activity of this grant. The broad range of research topics covered by this award, and the strong scientific base at UCSB and the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, provide an excellent environment for the education of young scientists. The PIs are also active in communicating science to the public, through lectures, writings, and interactions with the scientific press and the media, and several have written widely used textbooks. Part of the effort in lattice gauge theory is aimed at developing large-scale computational infrastructure for the entire U.S. lattice gauge theory community. The approach being taken has broad possibilities for application to computationally-intensive problems in many areas of science and engineering."
0.018941,"Although plant adaptations to aridity have been well studied in a few groups, such as cacti, relatively little is known about the diversification of most plants in deserts and other drylands. A group of milkweeds (Matelea subg. Chthamalia) inhabits dry or seasonally dry habitats in Mexico and the southwestern United States, providing a useful system for investigating adaptive diversification in arid bioregions. This group is part of a large, mostly tropical clade of milkweed vines (Gonolobinae) and most exhibit apparent adaptations to aridity. Many have lost their ability to twine (with stems spreading flat on the ground), have small, bell-shaped flowers, or are covered by an abundance of hairs. This research will use the most powerful available techniques to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Chthamalia and to analyze the evolution of adaptations to aridity. Next generation DNA sequencing employing a ?genome skimming? approach will be used to obtain complete chloroplast genomes, partial mitochondrial genomes, and complete nuclear ribosomal gene sequences to robustly estimate phylogenetic relationships, which will serve as a framework for evolutionary analyses of morphological adaptations.<br/><br/>This project will resolve the classification of little-known plants that have been taxonomically controversial. Several species of Chthamalia are exceedingly rare; resolving taxonomic questions and greater knowledge of their evolution will contribute to future conservation efforts of species and habitats. Integration of traditional systematic approaches with new molecular methods is critical to address hypotheses about evolution, adaptation, and speciation. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain laboratory and bioinformatic training as well as the opportunity to present research results at national meetings."
0.380127,"Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This project aims to construct a new class of materials, ""roto-electrics"", in which crystalline materials, normally thought of as composed of rigidly bound atoms, also contain molecular components that are free to rotate. Of particular interest are cases where the rotating components carry a permanent electric dipole moment. These materials have long been predicted but appear not to exist in nature and provide an opportunity to learn how to build new and potentially useful materials by design. Roto-electric phases are special examples of ferroelectric phases and ferroelectrics find application in such areas as memory sticks, high frequency filters in cell phones, and for controlling light polarization in displays. Roto-electrics offer the opportunity to miniaturize such components and to make them operate faster. The project supports the education of a graduate student, who receives Ph.D.-level training in the design of dipolar materials, in a wide variety of experimental spectroscopy techniques, and in the underlying materials theory. The project looks to involve under-represented minorities in nano-engineering research. It further leverages the training of future engineers in both nano-scale modeling and experiment, by the integrating the research results into materials science and engineering curricula. Project results and materials design insights are further distributed through physics, engineering, and educational websites.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The research team builds crystalline arrays of nearly-freely rotating dipolar molecules with a host / guest molecular-engineering approach. The present host systems are crystals, thin-films, and crystalline powders of the well-documented tris (o-phenylenedioxy) cyclotriphosphazene (TPP) material, which forms a hexagonal structure with open channels directed along the hexagonal c-axis. The channels are known to accept a large variety of guest molecules. The team investigates the dielectric phases that result from placing specially synthesized dipolar molecules, specifically designed to allow for nearly free rotation of the dipolar components, in the bulk of the TPP channels (3-dimensional materials) or at TPP surfaces (2-dimensional materials). These compounds are studied using a combination of radio-frequency dielectric spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, bulk and micro-Raman spectroscopy, and, for surface-localized and thin-film materials, with atomic force microscopy. Other probes, especially neutron diffraction and tip-enhanced Raman are investigated via collaborations. The new roto-electric materials are predicted to have ferroelectric waves that propagate at speeds far below those of traditional ferroelectrics, allowing e.g., for miniaturized surface acoustic wave devices. This research makes contributions to the assembly of molecular systems of nearly-freely rotating molecular components, and in demonstrating ordered dielectric phases in such materials. The project works to provide new insights into the construction of dipolar phases of matter, and has the potential to provide new useful materials."
0.02171,"The first international workshop on ctenophore biology will be held at the Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience in St. Augustine, FL on March 14-15, 2016. This meeting will bring together researchers studying the biology of ctenophores. Ctenophores, also known as comb jellies, are a group of animals found in nearly all marine environments (coastal and oceanic, deep sea as well as surface waters). Most species are planktonic and move by the beating of eight ciliary bands, which is the distinct morphological character uniting the group. Recent biogeographic and evolutionary findings, as well as published genomic resources and access to deep water have brought a great deal of attention to these animals, resulting in a revived research activity. The purpose of this international ctenophore workshop is to bring together the burgeoning community of ctenophore biologists, foster cross-disciplinary collaborations, discuss improvements and expansion of community resources, and share expertise relating to field, experimental, and culture techniques. Furthermore, the workshop has been designed to foster interactions between junior scientists (undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) and senior researchers to inspire the next generation of ctenophore biologists to identify and take on the big open questions that can only be answered by studying ctenophores. The recent influx of interest in these fascinating and important animals presents an opportunity to explore future directions and address some of the challenges for expansion of ctenophore research. This will be the first meeting completely dedicated to studying ctenophores, and the results will be published in an open-access journal to facilitate the broadest possible distribution of ideas generated during this workshop.<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that ctenophores are the sister group to all other animals and as such, are a critical group for understanding the biology of the last common ancestor of all animals. These findings have been corroborated by analyses of the complete nuclear genomes of two ctenophores. The availability of these data and the implications of the phylogenetic position (e.g., independent origin or loss of neural cell types within animals) have captured the attention of a wide audience, and research on these animals has grown. Although interest in ctenophores continues to grow, these animals remain relatively poorly studied and often misrepresented. Thus, it is important to identify ways to improve and expand community resources, as well as share expertise relating to culturing and experimental techniques. The workshop will bring together researchers from a variety of fields (e.g., taxonomy, ecology, neurobiology, evodevo, and behavior) to identify ways to improve resources, to foster collaborations, and to promote cross-disciplinary approaches to studying these unique creatures."
0.994315,"This is a research project on the physics and astrophysics of gravitational wave sources, partially in support of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO); it will be carried out by the Caltech Relativity Theory (CaRT) group, led by Yanbei Chen (PI), Christian Ott and Mark Scheel (Co-PIs). Through numerical simulations and analytical studies, this project will not only provide more accurate models for LIGO sources, but will also lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of space-time geometry and matter under extreme conditions - near black holes, neutron stars, especially when these extreme objects collide with each other. These more accurate models and deeper theoretical insight will also be applied to the analysis of LIGO gravitational-wave data. This project will serve as a training ground for young physicists and astrophysicists, by teaching them a wide variety of research techniques. Members of the CaRT will also pursue a wide range of activities that reach out to the broader scientific community and the general public.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will consists of three directions:<br/> (A) By combining analytical techniques and numerical simulations (using the Spectral Einstein Code [SpEC]): (i) Increasingly accurate gravitational waveforms for binary black hole coalescence will be generated and used to produce numerical template banks for LIGO; (ii) The geometrodynamics of highly curved spacetimes will be visualized and explored.<br/> (B) SpEC will be applied to the study of gravitational wave (GW) sources with matter (neutron-star binaries, neutron-star/black-hole binaries), contributing to a deeper understanding of: (i) their GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic emissions, as well as (ii) their use in constraining the nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Newly developed higher-order hydrodynamics methods will be incorporated into SpEC. With these, ultra-long inspiral simulations will be carried out and compared to post-Newtonian theory. Recently discovered EOS-dependence of NSNS post-merger oscillations will also be investigated in full general relativity.<br/> (C) The CaRT group will contribute to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration's (LSC) efforts to detect GWs and extract information from detected signals. They will (i) lead the effort to infer physics from future GW observations of core-collapse supernovae; (ii) participate in searches for GWs from distant core-collapse supernovae; (iii) improve methods for the detection of GWs from continuous sources such as pulsars."
0.194361,"Little is known about three-dimensional structures in the deep earth whose size is less than 100 km. These small-scale deep structures are important to understanding the historical and future evolution of earth's composition and its surface tectonics. They affect the shapes and amplitudes of seismic waves used to forecast the size of earthquake ground motions and to predict the differences between the seismic signatures of earthquakes and underground nuclear tests. Such small-scale structures cannot be imaged by conventiional seismic tomography, which processes travel times of seismic waves with methods similar to medical CAT scanning. Instead, this project employs a technique using seiismic recordings by many, closely spaced, seismometers to retrieve a characterisitic spectrum of scale lengths of small-scale structures. This specturm constrains the sizes, shapes, and composition of the heterogeneities. The project also trains graduate students in seismic data retrieval, processing, imaging, and computer programming. These are skills important in resource exploration and remediation of contaminated groundwater. Results will be incorporated in undergraduate courses in the physical sciences to enhance recruitment and training in both academic and industrial applications of geophysical research.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The characterization of small-scale heterogeneity (<100 km) is important to understand the surface sampling of Earth's mantle chemistry and the time history and nature of chemical mixing controlled by convection and plate tectonics. Directionally dependent scattering of seismic waves by small-scale heterogeneity can affect estimates of viscoelastic attenuation and anisotropy, which in turn are important for estimating temperature, mineral composition, and mineral phase. Amplitude and phase coherences of body waves recorded by dense arrays of seismic stations will be inverted to image statistical realizations of small-scale heterogeneity. This process of stochastic tomography will determine the characteristic lenth scales and seismic velocity perturbatons of the small-scale chemical and thermal heterogeneity of the earth that cannot be resolved by conventional tomography. The resullts will and test fundamental assumptions of convective miixing predicted from geodynamic models."
0.47,"The porosity and permeability of rocks is impacted heavily by reactions between minerals and through-going fluids. The resulting dissolution of minerals that are unstable at the temperature, pressure, and chemical conditions at which the fluids and rocks are interacting and the precipitation of more stable mineral species in the pores, fractures, and grain boundaries between minerals controls where and how much porosity a rock has and how easily fluids can flow through it. This research uses novel, flow-through, hydrothermal, reactor vessels where changes in the porosity and permeability of rocks and the precipitation and dissolution of minerals can be observed and measured in real time. Results of these experiments will be analyzed using a mathematical technique (i.e., Lattice-Boltzmann approach) that provides a better simulation of the fine-scale processes than mathematical techniques presently used in water-rock interaction studies that depend solely on continuum conditions. Intact cores of classic seafloor peridotites, rocks that commonly host or are the source of sulfide-rich, hydrothermal deposits on the seafloor, will be used in the experiments; and alteration of the original mineralogy will be tracked using the stable isotopes of Ca, Mg, and Si, which will document reactions and reaction rates of carbonate and silicate minerals. Broader impacts of the work include improving infrastructure for science by developing new experimental and mathematical methods to advance studies of water-rock interaction and how the porosity and permeability of geological materials change as rocks and sediments react with waters flowing through them. The research has significant potential applications in improving our understanding of the behavior of carbon sequestration reservoirs, the migration of pollutants, and the conditions of nuclear waste disposal. The project also involves undergraduate students from the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF-REU) program in cutting-edge science; trains a graduate student and a postdoc; and helps to develop and verify theoretical and model simulations use to predict the chemical and physical property evolution of natural rocks and fluids.<br/><br/>This research focuses on understanding the hydrolysis and carbonation of mantle peridotite by through-going aqueous fluids, an important process affecting the geochemical and geophysical properties of the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges and in subduction zones. Reactions will be examined using coupled experimental, analytical, and theoretical approaches that emphasize the time series monitoring of the chemical and physical evolution of peridotite-fluid systems using a novel flow-through hydrothermal reactor and transparent reaction cells that are coupled to an X-ray Computed Tomography instrument that allows changes in mineral dissolution and precipitation processes to be examined in real time and in high resolution. This allows direct investigation of changes in the 3D architecture of the rock on a fine scale during water-rock interaction. Chemical tracers using non-traditional stable isotopes (Si, Mg and Ca) will be used to constrain mineral dissolution and precipitation rates and indicate changes in mineral surface area. The experiments and their results will be modeled using a Lattice-Boltzmann multicomponent, multiphase, fluid flow and solute transport computer code with the results being used to develop more accurate reservoir-scale modeling approaches using continuum-scale simulators. Goals of the research are to investigate the feedback between fluid-mineral reactions and associated pore-space geometry changes in peridotites that result from processes like fluid flow, advection of chemical species, and reaction locations and reaction rates. Samples will consist of cores of seafloor peridotite."
0.2921,"With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Diana Cermak from Knox College and colleagues Katherine Adelsberger, Helen Hoyt and Mark Shroyer will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students at Knox College, Monmouth and Illinois Central College.<br/><br/>The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesis and characterization of camphor-sulfonyl derivatives and new phosphonates; (b) studying redox-activity of supporting ligands; (c) characterizing inorganic iron complexes, organic reaction products and organic ligands; (d) identifying phosphorus species and quantifying plant-available phosphorus within soils at Knox's biological field station; (e) studying solution phase magnetism and singlet-triplet splitting for Cu(II) carboxylate dinuclear species; and (f) studying lignans and peptides."
0.138707,"It is well known that a significant number of catastrophic disasters involving airplanes, bridges, and damns, for example, were due to the inability to identify impending fatigue damage of certain critical components. Therefore, in order to improve the safety, reliability, cost, and performance of structures and components, it is necessary to develop techniques that are capable of characterizing and quantifying the amount of material damage induced by cyclic loading. To meet this need, a suite of new ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques have been proposed. These new techniques will have the unique capability of detecting localized fatigue damage in metallic materials with dramatically improved accuracy, resolution and selectivity over existing ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques. Such capabilities are critical in many engineering applications including aircraft, automotive vehicles, nuclear power plants and civil infrastructures. The nonlinear wave mixing technique developed in this project will add one more tool to the existing toolbox for safe and sustainable operation of aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering systems. <br/><br/>Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques have been used extensively during the last half century. The vast majority of these techniques utilize only the linear behavior of the ultrasound. These linear techniques are effective in detecting discontinuities in the materials such as cracks, voids, interfaces, inclusions, etc. However, for ductile materials such as metals, it is the accumulation of fatigue damage that leads to crack initiation and eventual failure of the component. Unfortunately, linear ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation techniques are incapable of characterizing or quantifying such damage. To overcome this critical shortcoming of the existing technologies, new techniques based on nonlinear ultrasound will be developed in this project. Specifically, the project will develop the fundamental theories for the wave mixing phenomena in nonlinear elastic solids, and the measurement techniques for nondestructive evaluation of localized fatigue damage in metallic materials by utilizing the nonlinear wave mixing phenomena. The project consists of two tasks. Task 1 focuses on advancing knowledge of wave mechanics by developing mathematical models and conducting numerical simulations of the mixing of various types of waves in nonlinear solids. Based on the knowledge gained from Task 1, Task 2 will develop novel nonlinear wave mixing techniques for nondestructive evaluation of localized fatigue damage in metallic materials and structural components."

So, asymptotics may help mitigate some of the statistical error issue, but unfortunately, they carry an unmeasurable error and often lose important information. iii) Efficient Monte Carlo has a controlled error by sampling, but it still assumes a model in place and could lead to incorrect conclusions in case the model is incorrect. iv) Optimization techniques might help mitigate the problem of model uncertainty by computing bounds for the probabilities of interest, optimizing over the selection of models that cover the truth with high confidence. However, these might be too loose to be practical or the optimization problem could be too complex, thus the need from 1) to 3).

0.75,"This project will evaluate how mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial-nuclear interaction contribute to evolution across three levels of biological organization - molecular-genetic, cellular, and organismal. The PIs will study evolutionary process within the context of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Evolution experiments using ETC-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes will be combined with whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatics and mitochondrial phenotyping to study the genetic bases of maladaptive and compensatory adaptive evolution - the process whereby natural selection favors changes at loci that compensate for the deleterious effects of a mutant allele. The ETC is crucial for eukaryotic life and its proper functioning relies on the maintenance of favorable mitonuclear interactions; it is thus ideal for studying the patterns and functional bases of both forms of evolution and the role of mutation in shaping mitonuclear genome integration. Further, ETC dysfunction is a proposed cause of variation in genome-wide spontaneous mutation rates. This work will reveal the effects of different forms of ETC damage on nuclear and mitochondrial genome stability and concomitant changes in mitochondrial function and organismal fitness. Because few studies have addressed the population-level consequences of compensatory mutation or the genetic mechanisms of compensatory evolution in eukaryotic systems, and because mitochondrial metabolism and ETC function are highly evolutionarily conserved, findings are expected to be of broad interest and relevant to other eukaryotes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The project will train students in cutting-edge genomics research, provide important data and resources to the scientific community, and expand both PIs' educational and outreach activities.

The program will immerse undergraduates in courses and group projects relating to mathematical computation and data analysis, and promote faculty professional development through participation in workshops on computational science education. Students will be exposed to computational issues in multidisciplinary situations, including in industrial settings. The program includes the development of new courses and enhancements of existing ones that will permanently enrich the Computational and Data Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) curriculum at NJIT. Some of the enhancements are in courses that are taken by students in a wide variety of majors, and the changes will impact their careers in science and technology. The group research projects will use and develop fast and accurate algorithms to study problems in medicine, fluid dynamics, acoustics, climate modelling, and risk assessment. Many of the projects will lead to improvements in computational techniques for data analysis such as dimension reduction, data assimilation, and Monte Carlo methods. Valuable information will be gained and disseminated on effective ways to educate students in these computational techniques.<br/><br/>Computational tools are increasingly important in a broad number of areas in science and technology. For example, computer algorithms are used to predict the spread of an oil spill, investigate the properties of DNA, process and sharpen radar images, and assess the risks of investment portfolios and nuclear power plants. In many fields, extremely large data sets are being collected or generated, posing significant challenges to modeling, computer simulation, and data analysis. This five year EXTREEMS program will significantly enhance the exposure of undergraduate mathematical science students at NJIT to topics in CDS&E. This exposure will come from the broad infusion of CDS&E topics into the curriculum and a rigorous interdisciplinary research program that will introduce students to computational tools for the analysis of large data sets and modeling and simulation of complex systems. An important component of our program is the group nature of the proposed activities, including team projects supervised by multiple faculty, and participation of industrial partners. With expertise in scientific computation and data analysis and their honed leadership and communication skills, EXTREEMS students will emerge from this program with unique interdisciplinary skills and are expected to become future leaders in the mathematical sciences both in industry and in the nation's graduate programs.

0.341923,"CBET 1404591/1404655<br/>Li/Qian<br/><br/><br/>Solar energy supply is renewable, abundant, and environmentally benign. It is relatively free of problems associated with fossil fuels or nuclear energy, such as increasing fuel costs, waste disposal, heat dissipation, safety concerns, and the release of greenhouse gases. The solar cell is the key component of photovoltaic systems, which can directly convert the solar energy into electricity. While solar electricity generation technologies of today are dominated by silicon based materials, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost in fabrication, and their potential to be deployed in flexible structures. However, the energy efficiency of OSCs has thus far been impeded due to limited understanding of charge transport behaviors across length scales of OSCs; yet, such transport is crucial for device efficiency. The current try-and-error approach for optimization of OSC often fails due to nearly-infinite number of material combinations and processing conditions. The objective of this collaborative research is thus to develop a multiscale simulation and optimization methodology for OSCs that directly links the basic materials properties(electronic and optical), nanoscale morphology and their dependency on processing conditions (e.g. temperature and time), bulk material properties (e.g. bulk mobility), and device designs, to device efficiency. Successful completion of this research will pave a viable pathway for commercializing organic electronics in energy conversion, which can generate both green electricity and jobs throughout the United States. <br/><br/>The proposed research aims to merge simulation tools across multiple time and length scales using successive integration steps. The resulting tools would enable a holistic design approach where the design space will be systematically explored to dramatically improve the performance of OSC devices. Such a holistic approach integrates experimental validations to refine the simulations at each scale (micro, meso, and macro) and ultimately to verify the optimization results. More specifically, the research will verify the multiscale simulation by characterizing nanoscale morphology, measuring bulk mobility, and testing the devices. The PIs will then optimize the designs and fabrication processes of OSCs for high efficiency through surrogate modeling and sensitivity analysis of the multiscale models. Successful completion of this research will fill a critical knowledge gap in organic electronics research and will form a new simulation paradigm for organic electronics by accounting for multiscale coupling in charge transport and material properties and by experimental validation at each scale. The scheme to bridge the micro and macro scales in this project will set an example for multiscale simulation and optimization of other type of solar cells and energy devices such as super-capacitors and batteries. The results of these models and simulations will lead to more rational designs and greater potential for significant technological advances in OSCs."
0.389999,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical and computational research and education to advance first principles electronic structure theory. To calculate the ground-state nuclear framework, energy, and electron spin densities of an atom, molecule, biomolecule, solid, surface, or nanostructure within Kohn-Sham density functional theory, it is only necessary to solve self-consistent quantum mechanical one-electron equations. The results would be exact if the employed exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the electron density were exact. <br/><br/>The exact functional is not computable in practice, but practical approximations to it are improvable by adding additional semilocal or nonlocal ingredients to the exchange-correlation energy density to satisfy more exact constraints. Meta-generalized gradient approximations can enable accurate calculation of the properties of many material systems at or near equilibrium. However, they can surprisingly fail to predict accurate structural energy differences and transition pressures for solids as simple as silicon and silicon dioxide. The PI will develop a new meta-generalized gradient approximation which satisfies all possible exact constraints while recovering more of the intermediate-range van der Waals interaction, and test it for these and other problems. <br/><br/>For the description of stretched bonds over which electrons are shared, and thus of the 'strongly correlated' transition-metal oxides and lanthanides, hybrid functionals that employ a nonlocal exact-exchange ingredient have been surprisingly successful. However, these functionals typically rely on one or more empirical parameters, and can fail to satisfy basic exact constraints that even semilocal functionals satisfy. The PI will use a conjectured long-range limit to develop a nonempirical hybrid model for the correlation hole, for use with exact exchange. A byproduct will be a needed nonlocal correction to the random phase approximation.<br/><br/>An early self-interaction correction to the local spin density approximation has had some success for strongly-correlated systems, although its description of the equilibrium properties of more normal molecules and solids is disappointing and does not much improve with improvement of the underlying semilocal functional. The PI aims to fix these problems by eliminating the nodes of the self-interaction correction orbital densities through the use of complex orbitals, and by applying the self-interaction correction to the PI's improved new meta-generalized gradient approximation, which will have an improved description of compact one-electron densities. <br/><br/>A major recent development is the incorporation of long-range van der Waals interaction which is important for soft and biological matter, into density functional theory. The PI plans two different ways to add these effects to the best semi-local and nonlocal functionals that omit them. One involves the accurate calculation of van der Waals coefficients of all orders, with a summation of the infinite series and a short-range cutoff, and the other involves the extraction of the long-range part of a nonlocal van der Waals correlation energy functional. <br/><br/>Kohn-Sham density functional theory is widely used in chemistry and materials, and is increasingly used in engineering and geophysics. The improved functionals that result from this research will facilitate the computer design of new molecules and materials with desired properties. This award also supports educating postdoctoral fellows and students at all levels from high-school through graduate school.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The Chemistry Division and Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. It supports theoretical and computational research and education to advance the ability to compute the properties of materials accurately. Ordinary matter (atoms, molecules, and solids) is made up of electrons and nuclei. To predict its properties on the computer, and to design new materials with desired properties, we need to find the energy and spatially varying density of the electrons, including the effects of quantum mechanics and electrostatic repulsion. <br/><br/>Kohn-Sham density functional theory is a widely used method to calculate these properties. <br/>The energy and density can be found by minimizing a functional or rule for the energy in terms of the density. Reasonable approximations to this functional are known, and usefully describe the formation of atoms and the binding of atoms to form molecules and solids. The aim of this project is to use the knowledge we have about the exact functional to construct approximations that are more accurate but still computationally efficient. Better approximations for ""nature's glue"" that binds atoms to form molecules and solids leads to more accurate predictions of materials properties from the identity of the constituent atoms and the potential to design materials with desired properties.<br/><br/>New functionals that result from this research could be applied with good results in chemistry, biochemistry, nanoscience, materials science, condensed matter physics, and other fields. This award also supports education for postdoctoral fellows and students at all levels from high-school through graduate school."
0.061522,"This project concerns new research in the theory of reputation in repeated games, a branch of noncooperative game theory that has a wide range of applications in Economics, including to analysis of monopolistic practices, commitment in monetary policy, reputation in debt markets, credibility in information transmission and breakdown in credence good markets. The PI and his collaborator develop a new method to study reputation effects in two-player repeated games with equally patient players, imperfect monitoring and one-sided incomplete information.<br/><br/>Recall that the reputation effect is the phenomenon that the patient limit of the set of equilibrium payoffs of a repeated game changes dramatically when the game is perturbed by small amounts of incomplete information in the form of an ex ante small probability that one of the players is committed to a given strategy. In the benchmark case in which a long-run player faces a sequence of myopic short-run players, it is well known that reputation effects select the Stackelberg payoff in the patient limit under fairly general conditions. This provides a foundation for the intuitive idea that ""reputation substitutes for commitment."" The case where both players are forward looking and comparably patient, while clearly important, is not nearly as well understood. Existing results show that reputation effects are elusive when players have equal discount factors and monitoring is perfect. The investigator and a collaborator propose a methodology to study the case in which there is imperfect public monitoring, that is, the players observe a noisy public signal about their actions. The methods are used to show that, unlike the perfect monitoring case, when the informed player is imperfectly monitored and the stage game has common interests (a class of games that includes well known models of nuclear disarmament and currency attacks), reputation effects select the Stackelberg payoff in the limit as the common discount factor tends to one."
0.086495,"Computational methods allow the simulation of experiments that are too costly, too dangerous, or otherwise infeasible to perform in physical situations. Examples include evaluating the safety and efficiency of designs for nuclear reactors, predicting the frequency of breakdowns in power grids, and assessing the risks and rewards of financial investments. This research project will develop new ways of computing surrogate models for time-consuming simulations. These new surrogate models will be quicker to compute, avoid catastrophic computer error, and more faithfully represent the processes that they are designed to model. More clever ways of exploring future scenarios will be developed to decrease the computational time required to find the average, or the worst possible, behavior of complex systems such as those mentioned. The new algorithms arising from this research will be made publicly available for other researchers and practitioners. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in developing these algorithms will be better prepared for scientific careers.<br/><br/>Function approximation and integration are two fundamental problems in computational mathematics. This research project will construct algorithms for function approximation and integration that are computationally stable, avoiding catastrophic round-off error. These algorithms will be adaptive, determining the algorithm parameters based on function data to meet the user-specified error tolerance with rigorous justification. The algorithms will also be asymptotically efficient, requiring essentially the same computational effort as the best possible algorithms. Function approximation algorithms will be based on the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD decomposition that the investigators have developed for kernel methods. Integration algorithms will be developed that adaptively determine the sample size required. The investigators will continue to mentor students as well as post-doctoral scholars and will establish the usefulness of the algorithms under development through collaborations with domain specialists."
1.780366,"This collaborative research group will develop tools to help decision makers address energy and other environmentally related decision problems; develop and demonstrate new theory and interdisciplinary methods; and conduct highly interdisciplinary research that merges behavioral and decision science with engineering and other technical analysis. To mitigate the negative consequences of environmental change, such as extreme events, the energy system will have to be fundamentally transformed from its current carbon-intensive form. The research will address challenges and potential solutions for a cost-effective transition of the energy system and the likely consequences of different pathways for the future of that system. This collaborative group is based at Carnegie Mellon University and includes researchers from eleven other institutions. The collaborative group will (1) publish results in leading scientific and engineering journals; (2) brief and otherwise assist a wide range of energy and environmentally-related decision makers; and (3) educate interdisciplinary PhD students. In addition, the investigators will use the final year of the project to prepare a book that summarizes results that have been obtained by this collaborative group.<br/><br/>A first part of the proposed work will explore public understanding of air pollution and greenhouse gases. It also will explore public understanding of what is involved in making the transition to a future energy system composed of a broad portfolio of technologies and strategies. Research on public understanding and the development of strategies to improve fact-based communication will build upon ""mental model"" methods. A second part of the proposed work will involve the assessment of technologies and strategies that could: (1) facilitate or impede the transition of the energy system; (2) develop more sources of energy that are safe, clean, affordable, and secure; (3) increase the security and efficiency of the energy system; and (4) facilitate innovation in both technology and in organizations, regulation, and public policy. Strategies pursued in the short term in the name of transforming the energy system could be detrimental to longer-term progress (for example, shutting down clean nuclear power plants because, at the moment, natural gas is inexpensive, or developing an overreliance on natural gas). Activities undertaken in the third part of the proposed work will identify such potential problems and explore strategies to minimize the chances of getting stuck in future situations that block continued progress. Analysis of technical and regulatory issues associated with facilitating a more efficient and cost-effective transformation of the energy system will build upon a range of tools in engineering-economic and policy assessment.

1.2222,"Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis and the defining organelle of green plants. They have the essential role of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is ultimately the source of food and feed stocks. They are also involved in the synthesis of many nutrients and specialized chemicals useful to humans, as well as playing a role in sensing changes in the environment. Most of the functions of chloroplasts (and other plastids) are carried out by proteins encoded in the nucleus, the products of the Plastid-targeted Nuclear Genes (PNGs). This project, through an integration of computational and experimental approaches, will provide a mechanistic understanding of how PNGs are regulated transcriptionally in the model plant Arabidopsis, identify what the putative roles of the PNGs are, and define how various chloroplast functions are connected. Functions of PNGs implicated in amino acid metabolic networks will be experimentally verified. These studies will lead to a better understanding of plastid biology and will also broadly inform systems approaches to biology.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: In addition to enhancing our understanding of regulatory and metabolic networks in plastid function, this project will continue to make use of and disseminate the findings through a publicly available phenotype database (www.plastid.msu.edu ) that is of value to the scientific community in many contexts, including research and development for genetically-engineered crop plants. In addition to providing interdisciplinary training to postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, the project will integrate research and education as part of a successful summer internship program (www.plantgenomics.msu.edu). Junior and senior undergraduate students will work in participating laboratories each summer performing research related to the project. This program will have a strong emphasis on the recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities and women."
0.7,"Single-celled organisms, such as protists and bacteria, inhabit fluctuating environments where nutrient availability isn't always guaranteed. To cope with this ""feast or famine"" uncertainty, cells have evolved processes that allow them to respond appropriately by growing and dividing when nutrients are present (proliferation), or by becoming dormant and adopting an energy-conserving state when starved (quiescence). This project utilizes a single-celled reference organism, the green alga Chlamydomonas, to investigate how molecular switches that govern proliferation and quiescence are controlled and how they are coordinated to ensure that they don't interfere with each other. Microorganisms like these can accumulate large quantities of valuable compounds, e.g. oils, but only when starved. It is anticipated that knowledge about the molecular switches governing transitions between the states of proliferation and quiescence will allow predictions about how these states can be controlled and engineered. Thus, newly discovered details about these molecular switches provide potential engineering strategies to uncouple high yields of valuable compounds from starvation responses. Students and postdoctoral fellows from the two research locations will collaborate to identify and model the interactions between key regulators of quiescence and proliferation that have counterparts in many other species including plants and animals. The diversity of approaches and quantitative training components prepare the trainees for science careers in industry or academia. <br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to gain a predictive understanding of how nutrient and metabolic cues are integrated into coherent decisions that control life cycle state transitions. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two nuclear protein complexes, CHT7-C and RB-C, have been identified that govern the transitions between nutrient-deprivation induced quiescence, cell growth, and commitment to cell division. It is hypothesized that the quiescence regulator CHT7-C, and the cell cycle commitment regulator RB-C form an interlocking transcriptional network that coordinately controls cell growth and division responses to nutrient or metabolic cues. The objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize purified CHT7-C and RB-C complexes in order to define their subunit composition and modifications under different life cycle states; (2) Identify CHT7-C and RB-C target genes followed by generation of a transcriptional network model to observe common nodes that functionally couple the two complexes; (3) combine mutations affecting different components of the two complexes into isogenic lines to obtain synthetic phenotypes that provide insights into function and interrelation of the two complexes in vivo; and (4) build a testable logic switch model and develop quantitative markers to test and revise the model. The collaborative approach taken for studying the interactions between quiescence and cell proliferation regulators is aimed at transforming the understanding of the networks that establish and maintain coordinated global responses to metabolic and nutritional cues."
1.0,"Light is an important stimulus that triggers gene expression in biological organisms. The light dependent gene expression needs to be coordinated in different parts of the plant for efficient light harvesting and plant development. In this project, investigators will investigate how the proteins that perceive light (photoreceptors) in plants control a number of light dependent growth and development responses that occur in different parts of individual plant cells. The investigators will use bioinformatic, genetic and molecular approaches to examine different mechanisms of light triggered control of gene expression. In addition to training undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, broader impacts of the research include contributing to the understanding of how plants use light-dependent photoreceptors to tune chloroplast function to changes in the external environment. Such understanding is a prerequisite to allowing targeted regulation of plant photosynthetic efficiency and tuning of productivity. The project also includes structured mentoring in hands-on research of undergraduates from groups underrepresented in the sciences. <br/><br/>The theory that plant photoreceptors provide quantitative and qualitative control over distinct anterograde signaling networks from the nucleus to plastid to tune plastid protein-pigment content and plastid function to the external environment will be tested. The specific mechanisms by which phytochromes influence expression of nuclear-encoded sigma factors to match expression of nuclear and plastid genomes will be explored using bioinformatic analyses together with network modeling to build and test a signaling network responsible for phytochrome regulation of chloroplast development, tuning of photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis. Additionally, sigma factor-dependent effectors will be identified through transcriptomic and gene discovery approaches and characterized through plant phenotyping. In addition to the essential training of students and postdoctoral scholars, broader impacts of the research include investigating quantitative phytochrome-regulated processes to allow targeted regulation of phytochrome-mediated plant responses. A training component of the research is designed to develop the ability of undergraduate science majors and students from underrepresented groups, including women and underrepresented participants, to think analytically and critically through the participation in hands-on research. The project will include participation as a host lab for the Michigan State University Plant Genomics Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates, a program for visiting undergraduates from underrepresented groups and small and/or research-limited institutions."
0.08998,"The goal of this project is to develop improved models and numerical methods that advance the state of the art for incompressible fluid flow simulation. The key ideas are the better enforcement of geometric and physical laws in the computer algorithms, building a solid mathematical framework for the models and methods developed, and the devising of algorithms that will allow for efficient implementation on supercomputers. Although the simulation of fluid flow is a critical subtask in a wide spectrum of engineering applications, current tools and techniques are often unreliable and it is not uncommon for state of the art methods to take weeks or months (or possibly never finish with an accurate solution), even with thousands of processors, to perform simulations of flows around a car, through a nuclear reactor, or around part of an airplane. The project aims to develop mathematical prediction models and numerical methods that will provide more accurate solutions in a more efficient manner than state-of-the-art methods.<br/><br/>The PIs will construct efficient methods for incompressible flow simulation by constructing models and methods that better adhere to geometric structure and physical conservation laws than modern methods. The key components are to i) construct novel methods that are efficient and can correctly account for vorticity dynamics, and energy, helicity, and mass conservation -- this will require development of efficient boundary conditions and significant analysis to build a solid mathematical framework; ii) develop more efficient algebraic solvers for these methods that can be used on thousands of processors; iii) large scale testing on benchmark problems as well as on application problems with collaborators. Broader impacts include i) developing efficient methods for simulating high speed incompressible flows, which will improve the design process for a wide spectrum of applications in environmental engineering, in cardiovascular simulations, and in atmosphere and ocean sciences; ii) training graduate and undergraduate students through research involvement; and iii) developing large scale, parallel codes to be made publicly available as part of the deal.II library."
0.039772,"This award facilitates scientific research using the large new computational resource named Blue Waters scheduled to be deployed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the principal investigators at Purdue University, the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical team.<br/><br/>Chip design faces a crisis. The 40 year process of transistor downscaling has led to atomic-scale features, making devices subject to unavoidable manufacturing irregularities at the atomic scale and to heat densities comparable to a nuclear reactor. A new approach to design that embraces the atomistic, quantum mechanical nature of the constituent materials is necessary to develop more powerful yet low energy devices.<br/><br/>Electronic device engineering and material science must meet at the atomic scale to design new switching concepts. This demands the solution of quantum non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in systems in excess of 100 million complex degrees of freedom. Computations of this magnitude have been impossible, due to the lack of sufficiently powerful computers. Petascale computing creates an opportunity to pursue a multi-scale design approach that fuses nano scale (atomic) to the macro scale (wire), which will make possible new kinds of device designs that were previously unimaginable. The team is developing a general-purpose simulation engine. It will model electron transport in realistically extended devices using fully quantum mechanical (QM) models in an atomistic material description containing millions of atoms. Designers will be able to directly address questions of quantization and spin, tunneling, phonon interactions, and heat generation."
0.0317,"How is biodiversity generated and maintained? Much evidence suggests that parasites play an important role in both the origin and the maintenance of biological diversity. This project focuses on one of the most diverse groups of organisms on the planet: herbivorous insects, their parasites, and their microbes. The project targets three economically important groups of organisms: plants in the pumpkin/cucumber family, true fruit flies that attack these plants, and parasitic wasps that kill the flies. These wasps belong to a highly diverse and little studied group of species. Each wasp species can kill only one fly species; wasps attacking the ""wrong"" species of fly die. These bi-directional lethal interactions may be mediated by microbes (in wasps, flies, or both), by traits of flies' immune systems, or both. This project is designed to uncover the mechanisms (evolutionary, ecological, and immunological) affecting interactions that may help explain the diversity of life. Many species of true fruit flies are major agricultural pests; this project will greatly increase knowledge about factors contributing to their susceptibility to parasitoids. <br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses that predict that: 1) defenses of parasites and their hosts affect diversification rates; 2) mechanisms of virulence differ among lineages, and 3) selection arising from predator-prey interactions can affect rates of species-formation. To discover and identify mechanisms of diversification, participants will generate and analyze molecular 1) high-resolution genetic data, multiple nuclear loci, and mtCOI haplotypes to delineate species, and resolve deeper phylogenetic relationships; 2) microsatellites and ddRAD-seq markers to discover and quantify fine-scale genetic diversity within and among populations; 3) phylogenies and field experiments to test hypotheses about mechanisms generating and controlling diversity on ancient, recent, and contemporary timescales. Undergraduate students from all participating colleges and universities will participate in the research."
0.289,"With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Vassar College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The instrument will allow research in different areas including the synthesis of materials of potential commercial interest such as of carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and small molecules which are potential precursors to pharmaceuticals. Areas of biochemical interest such as the biosynthesis of lipids will be investigated. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by students at Vassar College, Marist College, SUNY New Platz and other undergraduate institutions in the area. <br/><br/>The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as (a) characterizing glycerophospholipid structures; (b) investigating titanium-mediated asymmetric imine alkylation; (c) charactering pyrrolidine substituted fullerenes; (d) developing biodegradable polyanhydride materials; and (e) studying C-Shaped diastereomers containing cofacial thiophene-substituted quinoxaline rings."
0.61,"Electrons have the fundamental property of ""spin,"" which is analogous to that of a spinning toy top, and is associated with their angular momentum. This project studies collisions between polarized electrons, which have their spins aligned in one direction, and so-called ""chiral"", or ""handed"" molecules (such molecules, of which DNA is an example, are characterized by a spiral, or helical geometry). These experiments address physics questions about the dynamics of electron-chiral molecule scattering, particularly with regard to the role played by the electron spins. They will also provide important clues about the origins of biological homochirality--the fact that all naturally-occurring DNA spirals in the same direction. Atoms of zinc are also being used as targets, to check the results of an experiment done recently by an Australian group in which zinc atoms excited by polarized electrons emitted light in a way that is forbidden by all known theories of atomic collisions. If the Australian result is reproduced, much of our basic theoretical knowledge on this topic will be shown to be in error. Improved sources of polarized electrons are also being developed, with the goal of ""turnkey"" ease of use. This project focuses on two particular ways to make polarized electrons: the first involves electron collisions with rubidium atoms in which spin is transferred from the rubidium to the free electrons. The second uses multiphoton ionization of semiconductors such as gallium arsenide to give the electrons a preferential spin direction. This research done to develop polarized electron technology holds the promise of providing new analytical tools that can be used for biological and materials research, and for industry. <br/><br/>The experiments involving collisions between polarized electrons and chiral molecules will extend previous work that showed chiral sensitivity in both quasi-elastic and reactive scattering with halocamphor targets. Now that such sensitivity has been observed, our goal is to demonstrate such effects in molecules that have biological significance, such as cysteine, and to study the effect of the maximum target nuclear charge and location of the target's chiral center on the chiral asymmetries we observe. The goal in the zinc experiments is to check whether the rather large value of canted linear polarization (polarization fraction P2) observed in fluorescence from excited zinc atoms is reproducible. No extant theory of electron-atom scattering, including the state-of-the-art ""R-matrix with pseudostates"" approach, has been able to confirm this result, even though they make quantitatively accurate predictions of other collision parameters for this system. Source development work will be based on the successfully demonstrated ""rubidium spin-filter"" design by our group, in which optically-pumped rubidium undergoes spin-exchange collisions with an incident unpolarized beam of electrons. This project will focus on improving the vacuum system, the rubidium target reliability, and the optical pumping protocol. It will also study a variety of buffer gases to understand the complex physics of the interaction between the electron beam and the rubidium vapor. In the gallium arsenide experiment, unamplified pulses from a femtosecond titanium-sapphire oscillator are used to photo-emit electrons. First experiments will investigate the intensity and polarization of the electrons emitted from bulk gallium arsenide and tip-like gallium arsenide shards. Then targets of gallium arsenide cusp arrays will be considered."
0.15,"The goal of this project is to advance the development of compact, next-generation light sources and other laser-based accelerators. Laser-plasma acceleration is a key enabling technology for a new generation of compact particle and radiation sources, but the existing theoretical understanding of the processes governing electron beam formation in such accelerators is incomplete. Further advances require development of computational tools with high physical fidelity, which is the expected outcome of this project. The project will aid in workforce development at all levels by providing training in the basic physics underlying advanced accelerator technologies. The research is expected to benefit society as a whole primarily through advancement of accelerator technologies based on plasma physics. Knowledge gained in this project will aid the effort to realize the technological promise of various laser-plasma accelerators with a wide range of applications from high-energy physics, astrophysics, and nuclear science to medicine, biology, and chemistry.<br/><br/>This project will result in the development of improved numerical models suitable for understanding the physics of electron beam formation and evolution in a large class of laser-plasma accelerators. This includes the development of a new two-dimensional Eulerian Vlasov-Maxwell simulation code. Comparisons of results from the new Vlasov-Maxwell solver and predictions of various particle methods will be used to identify regions of validity of the particle methods and to determine the key physical processes involved in electron beam formation and the origins of dark current in laser-plasma accelerators. The project will focus on studying electron beam formation in the bubble (or blow-out) regime.

0.28,"The capability to precisely control the dynamics of quantum systems constitutes a significant step in the advancement of quantum science and technology. State-of-the-art quantum technology can be used to trap and experiment with individual atoms (quantum optics), image brains and hearts (magnetic resonance imaging), generate structural and dynamical information of biological macromolecules (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), and process information and computation (quantum information and computation). All of these applications are enabled by the application of a single electromagnetic pulse or multiple pulse sequences. A typical problem is to engineer time-varying pulses that simultaneously steer a large ensemble (e.g., billions) of identical quantum systems from an initial state to a desired target state, or as close as possible, in a permissible amount of time. Such pulse design tasks are challenging because individual quantum systems in an ensemble have slightly different dynamics, such as different frequencies, but they need to be controlled by the use of a common control input. This project will develop a unified control-theoretic framework for systematically and effectively design pulses that optimally control the time evolution of quantum systems. This highly transdisciplinary research will not only result in innovative and significant contributions to systems theory and control engineering, but also generate promising contributions to biochemistry and medical physics. For example, this research will enhance resolution in medical imaging for precise medical diagnosis. The project will also support new initiatives to promote interdisciplinary education for students, in particular for those from traditionally underserved populations through the creation of summer research opportunities for students from local high schools in the city of St. Louis, MO.<br/><br/>By bridging ensemble systems theory with geometry and computational optimal control, general and versatile frameworks for quantum control will be formulated. Specifically, a dynamic mapping between nonlinear quantum spin systems and linear harmonic oscillators under optimal forcing will be constructed, which enables the derivation of undiscovered analytical broadband pulses, and an intuitive and elegant geometric connection of the evolution of a quantum spin ensemble with a helix on the Frenet frame will be established. In addition, an iterative algorithm based on the singular value decomposition and a universal optimization procedure integrating multidimensional pseudospectral discretizations and constraint partitioning techniques for designing unconstrained and constrained optimal pulses will be devised. In collaboration with experimental quantum control groups at different institutions in the United States and overseas, the developed methods will be employed to design practical pulses for protein NMR spectroscopy and MRI, as well as low-complexity pulses for portable medical imaging devices. These pulses will be experimentally realized and verified."
0.32,"Most flows in nature and in engineering applications are complex and disordered (turbulent). Dissipation of kinetic energy by turbulent flow around airplanes, ships, and submarines increases resistance to their motion (drag); about half of the fuel required to maintain the aircraft at cruise conditions is used to overcome the drag force imposed by the turbulent flow. Similarly, in wind farms, turbulence reduces the aerodynamic efficiency of the blades, thereby decreasing the energy capture. Understanding and controlling turbulent fluid flows plays an important role in these applications, and may critically impact US economy, national security, and the environment. The broader impacts of this award range from economic and environmental benefits to improved performance of wind farms, transporting pipes, and vehicles. The Principle Investigators (PIs) plan to organize a workshop on modeling and control of fluids at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications. This workshop will be aimed at showcasing utility of control engineering and systems theory to an interdisciplinary audience of students, researchers, and professionals from the engineering, mathematics, and physics communities.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project's effort lies in the novelty and interdisciplinary nature of the research. Second-order statistics of turbulent flows can be obtained either experimentally or via numerical simulations. The statistics are relevant in understanding fundamentals of flow physics and for the development of low-complexity models. Such models will be used for control design in order to suppress turbulence. Due to experimental or numerical limitations it is often the case that only certain spatio-temporal correlations between a limited numbers of flow field components are available. Thus, it is of interest to complete the statistical signature of the flow field in a way that is consistent with the known dynamics. The approach to this inverse problem relies on a model governed by stochastically forced linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Here, the statistics of forcing are unknown and sought to explain the given correlations. Identifying suitable stochastic forcing will allow the PIs to complete the correlation data of the velocity field. While the system dynamics impose a linear constraint on the admissible correlations, such an inverse problem admits many solutions for the forcing correlations. The PIs will use nuclear norm minimization to obtain correlation structures of low complexity. This complexity translates into dimensionality of spatio-temporal filters that will be used to generate the identified forcing statistics."
0.426,"Hydrogen is an ideal fuel for vehicles and other portable applications because it burns cleanly in air and the only byproduct is water. It also has a very high energy density, almost three times higher than gasoline. The main challenges to using hydrogen as a fuel, however, are its clean production and storage. Storing hydrogen as a gas requires large cylinders, and storing it as a liquid requires high pressures and very low temperatures. Both methods also present safety challenges. Dr. Prieto is exploring the use of solid compounds as storage materials for hydrogen. This approach offers small storage volumes at reasonable pressures. Light metal hydrides, such as magnesium metal, can store a lot of hydrogen per unit mass, but the drawbacks are that putting the hydrogen into magnesium requires high temperatures and pressures, and removing the hydrogen requires high temperatures and low pressures. Both processes are very slow. Dr. Prieto and her students have designed a method of making very small particles of magnesium that display much faster rates for storing hydrogen. The goal of her work is to determine whether the addition of small amounts of other metals to the surface of the magnesium can further increase the rates of adding or removing the hydrogen from the metal particles. She uses techniques such as X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray absorption experiments to help model the rates of the hydrogenation reactions and to provide data that aid in developing kinetic models to describe these reactions. Dr. Prieto involves students ranging from high school to graduate levels in her research, and the practical applications of this work serve as a useful recruiting tool to attract talented students and train them in research aimed at improving energy sustainability. Prof. Prieto communicates her knowledge of hydrogen storage and energy sustainability to the general public through her role as a board member of the Colorado Clean Energy Cluster, which is directly impacting policy in Colorado for economic development and projects related to clean energy production, storage, and transportation. This project is used as an example of basic research that can be easily linked to an application interesting to a wide audience, that of clean energy production and storage. <br/><br/>Hydrogen is an ideal fuel for portable applications because it burns cleanly in air to produce water, and it has a very high energy density. Magnesium (Mg), doped Mg, and Mg alloys are promising materials for hydrogen storage due to their high theoretical hydrogen storage capacities (e.g. 7.6 weight% for MgH2). However, bulk Mg is less than ideal as a hydrogen storage material due to the slow kinetics and high temperatures required for hydrogen absorption and desorption. Dr. Prieto is synthesizing nanoparticles of hydrogen storage materials in which the reduced size results in significantly enhanced kinetics for hydrogen storage. She is determining the relative roles of kinetics and thermodynamics on the hydrogen sorption and desorption of these particles, particularly upon addition of small amounts of transition metals to the surface. Although faster hydrogenation rates have been observed for nanoscale metal hydrides, very little is known about the roles of increased surface area versus impurities and defects. The targets Dr. Prieto is studying are earth abundant elements that are light and store large amounts of hydrogen, albeit sluggishly in the bulk. With control over the particle size and additive type and position, she can dramatically increase the slow hydrogenation rates observed in the bulk and, ultimately, be able to lower the temperature required for hydrogenation of these materials. This research results in recruiting and retaining a talented, diverse group of students."
0.699998,"The high-power laser systems currently used in various industries (automotive, aerospace, defense, nuclear and fusion energy, gas/oil, etc.) suffer from a lack of agile/intelligent control of high-power laser beam characteristics. They use the brute force of kW-class laser power to melt or evaporate materials without real-time process monitoring and intelligent feedback control. With the increasing demand for processing and joining a variety of novel material types and emerging development of additive manufacturing techniques, the high-power laser energy source technology must meet stricter fit-form-function requirements for excellent beam quality and precise spatial and temporal control of energy flux. This project is focused on development of a high-energy continuous wave (CW) Adaptive Phased Fiber-Array (APFA) laser system that is designed to fulfill these requirements, leading to yet unexplored opportunities for significant advances in laser material processing. Multi-kW power laser systems with excellent beam quality and adaptive beam control capabilities are also required in diverse, directed energy applications, such as long-distance battery recharging and optical power transfer, remote demolition of infrastructure elements in a contaminated area, future photon-assisted propulsion of spacecraft, and distant interrogation of asteroids.<br/><br/>Emerging from recent technology breakthroughs in high-power fiber-lasers and adaptive beam control, the APFA laser instrument includes: (a) a multi-kW CW laser energy source comprised of a seven-channel high-power fiber amplifier system, (b) a high-power adaptive fiber-array laser head with an advanced water-cooling system, (c) integrated sensors for adaptive mitigation of mechanical jitter and optical aberrations resulting from laser beam interaction with the material, and (d) a hybrid (feedback/programmable) control system for real-time manipulation of the high-power energy flux spatial and temporal characteristics. The proposed instrumentation combines in a novel single laser energy source the most highly desired characteristics and capabilities in laser material processing and directed energy applications including: excellent (M^2<1.15) beam quality at 10 kW power level, precise (submicron accuracy) electronic beam pointing and stabilization, wide-range focal spot steering and adaptive refocusing, adaptive compensation for mechanical jitter and heat-induced aberrations, programmable control of laser beam polarization, spatial and temporal coherence, and intelligent control of energy flux spatial distribution. The APFA laser energy source will substantially broaden research and provide an excellent opportunity for education and training in the burgeoning areas of fiber-laser technology, laser material processing and manufacturing, and advanced control, enhancing careers in these multiple scientific fields. The availability of the new laser system to both industrial researchers and University programs also helps the local area economy in its transitioning to high-tech industry."
0.249735,"The research objective of this collaborative study is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of modeling and control of Friction Surfacing-based Additive Manufacturing by creating a functionally graded, multi-layered weld transition joint between chrome moly steel (T91) and austenitic stainless steel (AISI316). The research approach will be to apply various nickel based alloy layers by friction surfacing, creating a smooth and gradual transition in physical and metallurgical properties to improve their creep life. The experimental program involves stress rupture and creep-fatigue tests to assess the creep behavior of the transition joints. The research approach for in-situ finite element modeling involves development of fine-scale crystal plasticity and homogenized anisotropic continuum plasticity models, which will help in obtaining the optimized process parameters for the fabrication of components using Friction Surfacing-based Additive Manufacturing. <br/><br/>If successful, this research will aid the accelerated deployment of T91 and AISI316 weld transitional joints for structures in emerging initiatives including boiler, nuclear and clean energy concepts. Through the finite element model development, not only can T91/316 joints be made, but a basic modeling and manufacturing infrastructure will be developed that can be applied to any application where transitional joints are needed between hard-to-process materials and/or materials where fusion welding produces undesirable intermetallic formation. The successful completion of this research will enable higher-temperature power plants to generate power 1) at lower cost 2) with lower greenhouse gas emissions and 3) in larger quantities resulting in a better quality of life. The results will also help make it possible to manufacture better performing and optimized components in a host of other engineering industries. The educational objectives of the proposal will focus on training of post-doctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students. Advanced Surface Technology course will be developed which will expose the students to the state-of-the-art advances in manufacturing technologies."
0.908,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of large backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. However, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the galaxy, yielding a day-night modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. Of current searches with directional detectors, the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment is a leader, having a decade of experience. The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFT's unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. <br/><br/>These advances in background rejection, combined with the fact that further limit setting capabilities are hampered by the small volume of DRIFT-II, suggest that DRIFT should scale-up. This award will enable the collaboration to continue running DRIFT-II in the Boulby mine in England. In addition to running DRIFT-IId, these funds will provide hardware for a second detector, DRIFT-IIe.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of hardware and software experience. Finally, the DRIFT detector technology has promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments."
0.12,"The main focus of this project is on dynamical systems. Probably the most important example is the time evolution of a physical system. Given complete information about its state at a particular time, one should be able to predict the state at any later time. If the dynamics is ""reversible"" (such as in Newtonian mechanics), one can also determine the state at any previous time. If there are no outside influences on the system, the new state depends only on the beginning state and how long the system was allowed to run, not on the particular time at which it started. (If you plant a seed in the fall, the result six months later will be different from the result if you plant it in the spring. However, if the climate were the same year round, the result six months later would be the same regardless of when you plant.) This setup is an example of an action of the group of real numbers: the set of possible lengths of time the system is allowed to run. Actions of other groups are also important. The group of integers corresponds to taking time in discrete steps, which is sometimes appropriate and is mathematically simpler. Other groups arise from symmetry in a system or from entirely different considerations. One main goal of this project is to better understand certain kinds of dynamical systems, at this stage primarily discrete ones but for which the groups can be otherwise complicated. One direction is to understand the relation between the system and a particular algebraic object, the so-called crossed product, constructed from the system. Another direction is the complete description in a special case (in which the collection of objects of the system is very complicated but the group is actually finite) of all possible systems.<br/><br/>The largest component of this project involves relating the properties of a minimal and essentially free action of a countable amenable group on a compact metric space to the structure of its crossed product. The plan is to push forward the boundaries of our knowledge in two two particular directions: (1) relating the mean dimension of a minimal homeomorphism to the radius of comparison of the crossed product (simplest group, namely, the integers, and most complicated space) and (2) proving regularity properties when the group is arbitrary but the space is the Cantor set (simplest space, most complicated group). It is also hoped that related methods will help with actions on simple C*-algebras when the action has the tracial Rokhlin property. The next component is the classification of pointwise outer actions of finite groups on purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebras, a much larger class of actions than the ones already classified (those with the Rokhlin property). The third component is the study of operator algebras on Lebesgue spaces with exponent different from two. This is a new field which turns out to be unexpectedly rich."
0.43,"In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr. Alexander Angerhofer, from the University of Florida, will study the molecular mechanisms by which the bacterial enzyme oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) and specific site-directed mutants catalyze the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond in oxalic acid. This enzyme may have important applications in the control of oxalic acid which is one of the most common naturally occurring toxins and the main ingredient in kidney stones. Advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques will be used to study the electronic structure and local coordination environment of two Mn ions in the protein subunit where catalysis takes place. Spin trapping will be used to investigate free radicals that are released from the protein during enzymatic turnover. Binding of substrate and various inhibitors to the enzyme will be studied with high-field EPR. These experiments will yield important kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural information about binding of substrate and inhibitors to the enzyme, and will test the current working hypothesis in which Mn and an associated bound oxygen molecule act as redox shuttles in the breaking of the oxalate C-C bond. The possible existence of a long-range electron transfer chain in the protein and its role in the catalytic process will also be investigated. While OxDC is of interest in its own right and may lead to future treatments of various oxalate-related pathologies (hyperoxaluria, kidney stones, etc.), the enzyme will also serve as an example of how a protein can control reactive radical intermediates. Site-directed mutants have been generated that have decreased oxalate decarboxylase but increased oxalate oxidase activites. Work with these mutants will help to elucidate how the structure of the active site can guide the chemistry and switch between decarboxylase and oxidase activities. <br/><br/>This project is tightly integrated into Howard Hughes Medical Institute ""Science for Life"" initiative at the University of Florida, which serves its undergraduate student population by bringing them into research labs early on. Each year on average two of the most promising undergraduate science majors will be directly supported in this project in the summer of their sophomore or junior years. They will have additional volunteer opportunities and perform research for credit toward their degrees which allows them to write an honors thesis during their senior year. These students will receive intensive mentoring by Dr. Angerhofer and his collaborators and will be given the opportunity to perform cutting-edge research, which will not only enrich their education but also provide them a perspective for a future career in the natural sciences. They will also have the opportunity to present their research at local, regional, and national scientific conferences. Dr. Angerhofer will make every effort to recruit students from groups that are underrepresented in the STEM disciplines."
0.45,"This project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, supports Valeria Kleiman from the University of Florida to investigate energy migration in conjugated model systems, the material of choice for organic solar cells. The scientific goals will be achieved through the combination of phase sensitive transient techniques with computational tools to investigate excited state electronic coupling in conjunction with nuclear motion. Materials under investigation will include building blocks for conjugated macromolecules and chemically modified dendritic structures with variable band gap energies which can be used for solar energy conversion. A broad impact in the community is expected through a strong educational effort intended to yield highly educated scientists, well versed on the latest tools of state of the art spectroscopy and theoretical calculations regarding light harvesting materials.<br/><br/>Solar energy conversion has the potential to provide enough energy to fuel the planet, but it requires an understanding of the fundamental properties to be able to create efficient and economic solar energy conversion devices.

0.450474,"Title: SHF: Small: Relational Parametricity for Program Verification<br/><br/>The software market is currently estimated at $500 billion per year, and this figure is likely to grow significantly in real terms as software becomes ever more ubiquitous. One crucial aspect of software is that it be correct, i.e., that software does what's intended and does not go wrong. Even failures of everyday devices like iPods and mobile phones are inconvenient and frustrating, but software leaking credit card details or voting records, causing an airplane to crash, launching nuclear weapons without authorization, or compromising the global financial sector can lead to unprecedented and clearly unacceptable global uncertainties. The ever-growing size and sophistication of programs makes formal verification methods --- which use mathematical techniques to ensure that programs actually perform the computations they are designed to carry out and do not perform unintended ones --- increasingly critical for building truly secure and reliable software. The broader impact of this research is to make possible the development of better and more widely applicable formal program verification methods, and, thereby, to help ensure that even large and sophisticated software systems are provably correct.<br/><br/>Relational parametricity is a key technique for formally verifying properties of software systems. Logical relations, upon which relational parametricity is based, provide a means of proving properties of a software system directly from the system itself. Logical relations have by now been developed for core fragments of many modern programming languages and verification systems. However, this has been accomplished by way of an enormous constellation of complicated and non-reusable logical relations, rather than by appealing to their uniform construction and transferrable development from fundamental principles. This research aims to improve the current state-of-the-art by providing an axiomatic framework for the construction of logical relations. The framework is principled, conceptually simple, comprehensive, uniform, and predictive. The intellectual merit of this research lies in its exposition and use of essential structures from category theory (""fibrations"") to address the significant technical problems of constructing logical relations, and conceptualizing relational parametricity in sophisticated settings. It also lies in the novel and uniform formulation of parametricity to which this research will lead, and the application of this new framework to specific state-of-the-art computational problems. To ensure its uptake, a logic and tool support for the new framework will be provided. While the tool will permit users to experiment with the framework, the feedback from their practical experiences will further fortify the new foundations for parametricity."
0.398651,"1336983<br/>Wood<br/><br/>The primary objective of the proposed research is to examine fast (high Reynolds number) flows in porous media. A unified approach is proposed, which integrates three research elements (1) upscaling theory (the method of volume-averaging ) with closure, (2) direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow in porous media, and (3) PIV experimental studies of flows in porous media. The study will cover a broad range of Reynolds numbers [Re ~O(100-4000)]. The overall goal of this work is to provide a cohesive theory (with extensive experimental validation) to describe rather high velocity flows in a packed bed in a way that is consistent with the widely-used empirical expression known as the Darcy-Ergun-Forchheimer equation.<br/><br/><br/>The wide range of applications of high Re flows in porous media includes gas adsorption, filtration, catalyst reactions, combustion, heat transport and other processes in fixed bed reactors, nuclear reactors and subsurface groundwater remediation. Due to the complex and irregular flow geometry within the pore space, the confining aspects of the flow, and the variable length scales, it is difficult to properly define the mean flow structure and associated turbulence of high Re flows in porous materials. These same complexities make experimental observations and numerical simulations extremely difficult. To date there exist few detailed PIV or DNS data for turbulent flows in randomly packed porous media, and none that cross validate among DNS and experiment. The proposed research brings together unique and complementary expertise and capabilities in experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches. Combined experiments and simulation data will be used to enhance our understanding of the flow physics in porous materials. The upscaling approach, which will focus on providing a consistent theory, has the potential to transform modeling approaches for heat or scalar transport in densely packed porous media. The experiments will involve pore-scale velocity field data for both simple cubic packing and randomly packed porous beads using three-component time-resolved particle image velocimetry. The DNS work will focus on high-fidelity, fully resolved direct numerical simulations of steady/unsteady inertial, transitional and turbulent flows. The detailed data from both sources will elucidate the complex flow structures and turbulence characteristics needed to form a theoretical basis for the development of a predictive tool for macroscopic flow and transport properties in porous media. Specifically, the data will facilitate direct evaluation of non-linear, closure terms due to unresolved, sub-grid scales of motion in the model.<br/><br/><br/>The research plan will become the basis for training students and helping them appreciate the need for the integrated analysis necessary for complex problems. The PIs have a track record of involving underrepresented groups in their laboratories, both graduate and undergraduates (such as Textronic Scholars [available to first-year women] and University Honors Students. This project will reach out to developing engineers to provide a learning opportunity through the OSU-SMILE mentoring program for middle school students (which targets underrepresented groups). International exposure through collaborations with Insitut de Mecanique des Fluides de Toulouse will also be available to students. In addition the graduate students will be supported through the proposed grant and departmental funds to present their work at international and national conferences. The investigators will plan two special sessions at international conferences (such as AGU) during the final year.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Fluid Dynamics and Particulate and Multiphase Processes Programs in Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division."
0.329618,"Convex optimization methods are important in control, signal processing, machine learning, and many other fields of engineering and applied science. Advances in algorithms for convex optimization over the last twenty-five years have resulted in reliable and user-friendly software tools that are widely used in academic research and industry. The most popular software packages are based on a separation between a modeling front-end and a general-purpose solver for semidefinite optimization (a matrix extension of classical linear programming, and a special case of conic linear optimization). The task of the modeling front-end is to translate the optimization problem into the canonical form required by the semidefinite optimization solver. The techniques used in this translation step are the outcome of extensive research on how to represent nonlinear convex constraints in the semidefinite optimization format. The algorithms used in the solvers are primal-dual interior-point methods for semidefinite optimization, which reached a high level of maturity in the early 2000s. Each of these two layers brings a limit on scalability. The reduction to semidefinite optimization in the modeling step often requires the introduction of auxiliary variables and constraints, which can increase the size of the optimization problem considerably. In addition, the semidefinite optimization algorithms that are commonly used in convex optimization solvers are second-order methods and require in each iteration the solution of large, often dense, sets of linear equations. This further limits the size of the problems that can be solved. This proposal is motivated by the increasing demand for large-scale convex optimization algorithms in control, signal processing, and system identification. The project focuses on developing specialized methods for two types of constraints that underlie some of the most important convex optimization applications in these areas, and that have recently found new applications in statistical signal processing and machine learning. <br/><br/>The first class of problems consists of convex optimization problems involving convex cones of nonnegative Popov functions. This includes nonnegative matrix polynomials and trigonometric polynomials, and is of fundamental importance in linear system theory, control, and signal processing. The second class includes system identification methods based on minimizing the nuclear norm (trace norm) of structured matrices. The focus on these two problem classes is motivated by several reasons: first, their central position in system theory and signal processing; second, well-known difficulties in solving them using general-purpose semidefinite optimization software; and, third, their importance in recently discovered techniques that extend 1-norm optimization methods for sparse signal recovery to sparse signal recovery problems over continuous domains and to matrix rank minimization problems. Two algorithmic approaches will be considered for each of the two problem classes: interior-point methods for non-symmetric conic optimization, that handle the constraints directly without embedding them in a much larger semidefinite optimization problem, and first-order proximal algorithms based on operator splitting and decomposition techniques."
0.600016,"This CAREER proposal, co-funded by two Divisions in the Directorate of Geosciences (Earth Sciences and Atmospheric and Geospatial Sciences), is constructed around a plan for improving our knowledge of the source physics and atmospheric propagation effects that take place during volcanic eruptions while training students and international participants in these novel techniques. When volcanoes erupt they impinge upon the atmosphere and produce high-amplitude acoustic radiation. These volcano sounds are comprised of both high frequency (i.e., audible) and sub-sonic energy (i.e., low frequency, or infrasonic) components, which are directly relatable to the style and intensity of an eruption. Volcano acoustics is thus an important tool for both remotely tracking an eruption, which is vital to volcano monitoring endeavors, and for quantifying material fluxes, which is fundamentally important for studies of eruption dynamics. Moreover, because low frequency volcano sounds are often exceptionally intense they are generally detectable at distances ranging from tens to thousands of kilometers from the volcano. This allows for implementation of acoustic remote sensing networks for continuous surveillance of restless volcanoes and to probe the intervening atmosphere to track changeable winds and temperatures, which influence sound propagation.<br/><br/>Toward the improved understanding of eruption source physics and atmospheric propagation effects, PI Jeffrey Johnson and colleagues, along with a team of graduate students, will investigate volcano acoustic sources and the evolution of these signals as they are transmitted through the atmosphere. During proposed field work the research team will utilize dense networks of specialized broadband microphones to record the intense (and often continuous) acoustic signals produced by a spectrum of active volcanoes in Latin America. Together with conjoint optical, multi-spectral, and meteorological observations they will develop and test models of sound generation and atmospheric sound transmission. Acoustic source physics and propagation modeling have vital impacts for the burgeoning fields of atmospheric infrasound studies, which encompass disciplines as varied as nuclear test ban monitoring, explosion physics, urban noise pollution, microbarom climatology, atmospheric tomography, and geophysical investigation of phenomena such as thunder, bolides, and earthquakes. Broader impacts of the proposed volcano dynamical studies are also expected to lead to development of improved surveillance techniques for monitoring hazardous volcanoes, which can ultimately lead to better forecasting and mitigation of volcanic hazards. The international nature of this work will foster collaboration between scientists in the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, and Chile."
0.75,"In the human body, approximately half of all proteins are decorated with sugars. These hybrid structures are known as glycoproteins. Glycoproteins can be found inside cells, attached to their external surfaces (cell membranes) or in the extracellular space. There is increasing appreciation that the sugar component of these glycoproteins plays a crucial role in human health and disease, for example, in bacterial and viral infection, cancer, immunity, and diabetes. Efforts to understand these cellular processes depend upon knowledge of the chemical structures of the sugars on the protein, that is, what sugars are present, how they behave in three dimensions, and how their shapes change over time. This project will develop new analytical tools to investigate and assign sugar structure in solution. Students will be cross-trained in both experimental and theoretical methods ranging from chemical synthesis of sugars to advanced computational methods used to predict their molecular structures. The work aims to provide new crosstalk between experiment and theory, with the intent of refining both into more powerful tools to understand glycoprotein structure.<br/><br/>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division and the Computational and Data-Enabled Sciences and Engineering Program is funding Drs. Anthony Serianni and Ian Carmichael of the University of Notre Dame, and Dr. Robert Woods of the University of Georgia, to develop new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and computational tools to predict the three-dimensional structures and dynamics of the high-mannose and complex-type N-glycans of human glycoproteins. This research group will use redundant NMR J-couplings to experimentally determine conformational populations about the rotatable bonds comprising the O-glycosidic linkages in these N-glycans. To achieve this goal, computational methods (density functional theory) will be used to derive new equations that relate the magnitudes of specific J-couplings to specific torsion angles in the linkages. Armed with new experimental data on conformational populations, comparisons will be made between the experimental findings and theoretical conformational populations obtained from solvated molecular dynamics simulations, in an effort to validate the MD predictions or justify modifications in the equations underlying the MD method. The long-term goal is to determine the detailed structural properties of biologically important complex oligosaccharides, either free in solution or bound to proteins or lipids. This knowledge will prove valuable in understanding how N-glycans exert their myriad biological functions."

0.440142,"In order to carry out any detailed study of nature on large scales, we often require a precise understanding of the microscopic processes that govern our universe. One of these, called opacity, measures the precise way that electromagnetic radiation (light, in all of its forms) interacts with atoms, molecules, and free-floating subatomic particles. Recent results from studies of the Sun's interior indicate that previous calculations of the relative abundance of the elements are off by an uncomfortable amount. The PI and his collaborators are world leaders in the field of laboratory astrophysics. They will improve the accuracy of opacity calculations guided by results from computer models of stellar interiors, by recent experimental physics results, and by including effects that were previously omitted. While it is primarily theoretical, this work has a very broad range of practical applications in and beyond astrophysics. These include nuclear fusion and medical physics. The PI is active in several programs promoting collaborative US-India efforts in STEM education. This project will involve specialized training of a postdoctoral fellow in this multi-disciplinary research.<br/><br/>The PI will lead an effort to properly account for bound-free autoionization resonances and calculate mean opacities for a variety of compositions using improved atomic data and a new high-precision version of the Opacity Project codes. Recent helioseismology results, results from the Z-pinch inertial fusion device at Sandia National Laboratory, and re-examination of current opacities all suggest that true opacities are significantly higher than current models. This work could lead to the solution of the ""solar abundance problem"", and it is all but guaranteed to lead to improvements in fundamental atomic physics, the equation of state appropriate for stellar interiors that incorporates opacities of elements produced in r-process nucleosynthesis, and improved Rosseland and Planck mean opacities. It is a continuation and extension of prior successful work by the PI and his collaborators, guided by recent measurements and by improvements in computational techniques. Results will be made available to the physics, chemistry, and astrophysics communities via electronic databases."

Rare astrophysical events predicted to occur in both 2014 and 2018 will be observed, perhaps offering an indirect study of gravity around the SMBH. The central region of our galaxy provides a unique laboratory for understanding how SMBHs are formed and why they are so common in galactic nuclei, and it provides a laboratory to test our fundamental notions of gravity.

0.42,"Haobin Wang, of New Mexico State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational method in the Chemistry Division and the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) program to develop and apply computational approaches to study electron transfer processes in several technologically-important materials and devices such as dye sensitized solar cells, molecular junction devices, and new electronic/magnetic materials. Because electrons are very small objects, they obey the laws of quantum mechanics. To get a sufficiently accurate description of many of these systems, quantum mechanical methods must be applied to both the electrons and the atomic nuclei. Professor Wang and his colleagues have developed an accurate and efficient quantum mechanical approach that is designed for this purpose called the multilayer-multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) theory. The fundamental understanding resulting from this research contributes to the rational design of new materials such as for solar energy conversion and molecular electronics. The numerical techniques and software developed in this project have potential applications to a broad range of problems in science and engineering, e.g., numerical methods, signal compression, and parallel computation. Both undergraduate and graduate students contribute to this research. <br/><br/>With the extension of ML-MCTDH to the second quantization representation for treating identical particles, the theory is formally complete. The purpose of the current research is: (i) to investigate as many important physical models as possible that can be treated accurately via the current ML-MCTDH implementation; and (ii) to develop new algorithms within the ML-MCTDH framework to treat more general models. Specifically, the principal investigator and his coworkers apply the current theory to a variety of important and challenging problems in physics and chemistry, e.g., heterogeneous electron transfer using the Anderson-News model, spin relaxation where the electronic and nuclear spins are treated on equal footing, and the Kondo effect using the Anderson impurity model. Beyond those straightforward applications the current implementation of the ML-MCTDH theory is being extended to more general forms of potential energy functions. Further goals are to improve the relevant ML-MCTDH algorithms, e.g., using multilayer improved relaxation to generate the initial density matrix at low temperatures, grouping and streamlined evaluation of a series of operators, and modifying ML-MCTDH equations of motion that remove the regularization of the numerical singularities. The software developed in this research will be made freely available to the research community."

Scott<br/>Proposal Number: 1512228<br/><br/><br/>The sustainable production of important chemicals and fuels at large scale can be achieved by using renewable resources such as non-food biomass. The selective conversion of biomass-derived carbohydrates to specific chemicals in liquid water using porous solid catalysts is controlled in part by the molecular movement of biomass derived carbohydrate molecules into the porous structure of the catalyst, as well as the movement of products out of the porous structure. This project will study the fundamental science underlying the interactions between water, catalyst pore structure, carbohydrates, and products using high resolution measurement techniques which probe the molecular interactions of these materials. The outcomes of the research may suggest ways to adjust the catalysis process to achieve higher yield and selectivity of products in shorter times. Through this research, students will be given opportunities for advanced training at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to understand the interactions between water, biomass-derived carbohydrates, and furan-based products within porous catalysts. The use of lignocellulosic biomass on the scale required for significant production of carbon-based fuels and chemicals will likely involve continuous liquid-phase processing with heterogeneous catalysts in many of the chemical conversion steps. Various components of the reaction medium, including solvent, reactants, intermediates and products, will partition within the porous catalyst material. Differential absorption of molecules into the pores and their specific adsorption onto the pore walls are hypothesized to have profound consequences for selectivity, based on observations of dramatic effects in mixed solvent systems where an organic solvent is combined with water. To elucidate the nature of the interface confinement at the molecular level and to quantify the extent of these interactions, the research will use ex-situ and in-situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitoring of solid-liquid interfaces, via the use of specially designed high temperature-high pressure magic-angle-spinning probes, to assess local structures of carbohydrate-derived molecules and their rates of transformations in porous materials such as zeolites, mesoporous silicas and organosilicas, and carbons. This information will be combined with calorimetric measurements that probe the thermodynamics of absorption/adsorption phenomena, and gravimetric measurements to probe their kinetics. As part of this research, students will be trained on advanced NMR techniques through the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Knowledge gained on the behavior of interface-confined species will identify pore structures that select for reactants, promote desired reactions and expel specific desired products, such as furanics."
0.024615,"Astronomical observations are now probing the early stages of the universe, in which galaxies developed and merged, and the formation of the structures in the universe at the present era was set in motion. An important part of this story is the chemical evolution of galaxies. The formation of the elements in the first stars and their subsequent dispersal are powerful tracers of structure formation and evolution in the early universe. The elements are synthesized deep in the interiors of stars well beyond the reach of direct observation. For this reason, understanding their synthesis and the environment which enables it is clearly in the realm of theory. Although stellar evolution theory is one of the oldest branches of computational science, it has only recently become possible to accurately simulate<br/>some of the key events and processes inside stars that give rise to the heavy elements that are injected back into the interstellar environment rather than being swallowed up in collapsed objects. These events can be quite brief in some cases, lasting only years, days, or even seconds in the case of explosive phenomena. The brevity of these events makes it possible for us now to simulate them in full 3-D detail. This project aims to build a new and powerful capability to simulate these events by coupling together 3-D simulations that cover brief time intervals with 1-D simulations spanning much longer times.<br/><br/>This project will simulate processes deep inside stars of the early universe that involve hydrogen ingestion events caused by mixing of material across the boundaries of convection zones. In 1-D stellar evolution simulations, these give rise to rapid hydrogen burning, with enormous energy release and causing nucleosynthesis by neutron capture from neutron fluxes intermediate between the slow (s) and rapid (r) processes. This is the intermediate, or i-process nucleosynthesis that is targeted in this study. Accurate treatment of the convective boundary mixing that drives this i-process requires full 3-D simulation. In some cases that will be addressed, it is possible to simulate the entire event in 3-D. In others, the 3-D simulations performed at intervals as part of a coupled 1-D and 3-D stellar evolution calculation will serve to recalibrate the coefficients in approximate 1-D models for dynamic mixing processes. Such coupled calculations will use these periodic model recalibrations to validate the use of the models as the calculation progresses. When unacceptably large revisions of model ""constants"" are indicated, a recomputation with 3-D recalibrations taken at shorter time intervals will result. This new process called autocorrecting modeling involves periodic generation of large amounts of 3-D data from simulation codes. This data generation is followed by a detailed analysis of the data in terms of 1-D models. The results of this analysis are then fed back into the 1-D stellar evolution computation. In the process of carrying out the simulations a large database of results from 3-D simulations of convective boundary mixing in stellar interiors will be generated. This database will be organized so that the simulation codes can mine it automatically, comparing it to a variety of potentially useful 1-D models of the mixing process. This database, together with the tools that mine it, analyze it, and display results, will be unique. It will represent a significant investment, not only in our time developing the simulation codes and data analysis and visualization tools, but also in computer time on one of the most powerful computing systems in the world. A broad impact of this project will therefore be this database and tools that make it useful in stellar evolution research. The project will result in the development of new, automated techniques for data-enabled science but in addition to these techniques an important outcome will be the data itself which will be made available to the community on-line in a useful format. The hydrodynamics simulations will enable the clarification of the nucleosynthetic yields of the i-process in early generations of stars. The PI will work with the NuGrid collaboration to see that the results become incorporated into data sets that are available to the community for chemical evolution simulations of galaxies and structures in the early universe. The PI is also collaborating with the scientists at NSF?s Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA). A further impact of this work will be to perform the detailed simulations that allow the assessment of the impact of these new rate measurements on nucleosynthesis, so that it can be compared with observables such as spectra of metal-poor stars in globular clusters and isotopic compositions of pre-solar grains."
0.6,"This CAREER award will enable the PI, Patricia Vahle, Assistant Professor of Physics at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, to participate in the commissioning and operation of the NOvA Integration Prototype Near Detector (IPND). This CAREER program describes a plan of research with realistic potential for broader impact which takes good advantage of the PI's experience and expertise and positions the PI to make a significant contribution to NOvA in the areas of calibration and data analysis, areas which are obviously important too for future particle physics experiments. The IPND will be installed on the surface at Fermilab starting in the summer of 2010, providing a test bed for the NOvA detector design and systems integration. After a year of running on the surface, the detector will be disassembled and reinstalled underground, becoming the NOvA near detector. The neutrino data collected with the detector allow for the development of detector calibration techniques, signal versus background separation algorithms, and tests of the simulation of nuclear hadronization and reinteraction processes, all of which are crucial to the success of the experiment. Within the broader impact, the project will be a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc. The IPND program offers ample short term hardware and analysis projects, ideally suited to an undergraduate summer research experience. To ensure a vibrant scientific program into the future, one needs to capture the imagination of students well before they enter college. To that end, Vahle proposes providing local high school and middle school teachers the opportunity to participate in summer research projects on site at Fermilab. In the summers she is in Williamsburg, she would exploit the relationship developed between the W&M neutrino group and the local school teachers by employing a teacher for several weeks over the summer to help develop, then implement, science events."
0.357,"In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jochen Autschbach of the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, and his research team will develop theoretical models for the calculation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, and for optical activity such as circular dichroism and optical rotation. Approximations made in density functional theory (DFT) and their impact on NMR and optical activity calculations will also be investigated. This work will advance our understanding of structure-specific NMR parameters, of NMR relaxation phenomena, and the structural and electronic origins of natural optical activity. In addition, the influence of the chemical and physical environment on these molecular properties will be explored.<br/><br/>This research will not only advance our understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and measured spectroscopic and optical properties of molecules, but also our general understanding of the interaction of light and matter. Theoretical methods and software developed during this investigation will be made available to the larger community of scientists. In addition, this research project will be a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students. The student experience will be enhanced by the collaborative nature of the project; while the work within the Autschbach group is computational, it will be done in the context of collaborations with experimentalists from a variety of fields, including materials science and catalysis."
0.299519,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project is developing a new type of material consisting of a mixture of two different materials that are forced together. Naturally these two materials would not mix; however, if mixed artificially, the mixture exhibits unique properties because a small external stimulus can lead to a large change in the material structure. The unique properties anticipated for this material include a strong deformation when applying a voltage or a magnetic field. For example such a material is useful for building a new type of frequency filter, which would increase the data rate of mobile devices by ten to hundred times. These new properties may facilitate a whole range of transformative applications, including, for example, magnetically driven micro-switches for biomedical implants, emergency valves in nuclear power plants that operate without any external power source or communication pathway, tough and resilient coatings that remain functional despite frequent temperature cycling (for possible application in high-temperature fuel-efficient jet engines).<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project is developing an understanding of structural instabilities in ternary nitrides ABN where AN and BN form different equilibrium crystal structures. The key idea is that single-phase solid solutions of such ternaries with an intermediate composition exhibit a structural instability that leads to anomalous physical properties, including a reversible plastic deformation or a diverging piezoelectric response. Ternary nitride layers are deposited by reactive sputtering. Epitaxial constraints, composition variations, and ion-surface interactions are used to control the emerging phases, microstructure, texture, strain, and possible phase separation. The structural instabilities of single-phase solid-solution ternary nitrides at elevated temperature and pressure are studied to determine the structure-strain-energy landscape, using in situ x-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopies. Emerging anomalous properties are measured and an understanding of how the structural instability leads to a reversible plastic deformation, an anisotropic effective Poisson's ratio, a divergence in the piezoelectric response, a magneto-mechanical coupling, and a reversible stress-induced shear transformation are developed. The project includes training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art materials synthesis and characterization, as well as involvement in major outreach efforts to encourage girls to consider a career in science and engineering."
0.460079,"The matter in the universe is composed overwhelmingly of hydrogen and helium, which were the only elements made in substantial quantities by the big bang. All the heavier elements, which astronomers refer to generically as ""metals,"" were made by nuclear reactions in the cores of stars, ejected at the ends of the lives of those stars, and then recycled into a next generation of stars and planets. We understand reasonably well how metals are made and ejected from stars, but relatively little about the path they take post-ejection. The goal of this proposal is to greatly improve our knowledge of this process, and thereby to understand the life cycles of the elements that make up our planet and our bodies. The project will involve computer simulations of the flows of metals through and potentially out of the disk of a galaxy. Within the scientific community, the results generated by this project will be of use to people studying both stars and cosmology, and the project itself will help train a new generation of scientists. The broader impact of the work involves a volunteer organization which teaches math and science to inmates in Santa Cruz County Jails.<br/><br/><br/>To address the question of how metals are transported through galactic disks, the PI, his collaborators, and students will carry out a campaign of simulations of both isolated shearing boxes and entire galaxies, including a variety of mechanisms for generating instability and transport. They will also conduct simulations of the launching of galactic winds by supernovae, in order to understand how supernova ejecta are or are not mixed with the ambient ISM on their way into a wind. The simulations will use either Athena or PENCIL for the isolated boxes, and ENZO for the whole galaxy and galactic wind calculations. The results of the simulations will be incorporated into a 1D galaxy evolution code in order to study the long-term radial distribution of metals, and both the 1D and full 3D results will be compared with observations. The simulation result will be expressed in the form of parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficients) suitable for other groups to use in semi-analytic models or full cosmological simulations that lack the resolution to model metal diffusion processes self-consistently, and thus must rely on subgrid models. The 1D galaxy evolution code is also open source, and is available for use by the community. The broader impact of the work involves a volunteer organization which teaches math and science to inmates in Santa Cruz County Jails."
0.4,"The investigator will study combinatorial models that arise in connection with certain structures on two-dimensional lattices, such as domino tilings, Young tableaux and alternating-sign matrices. One focus of the research will be enumeration questions, where the goal is to derive exact formulas for the number of combinatorial objects satisfying certain properties. Another emphasis will be on a probabilistic analysis of random combinatorial objects, and in particular their limit shapes, which are geometric shapes that arise in the asymptotic limit when the size of the model becomes large. More generally, the study of combinatorial models in a probabilistic setting raises many fascinating questions, for example questions about limiting fluctuations and about connections to random matrix theory. The technical toolbox of techniques that the investigator hopes to employ to attack such problems is very varied and involves both algebraic methods (e.g. generating functions, linear algebra), analytic methods (for example the calculus of variations) and general probabilistic techniques.<br/><br/>The scientific and educational value of the project is manifold. The combinatorial objects of interest have delighted pure mathematicians for many years for their inherent beauty and elegant structure. But also, amazingly, such seemingly ""useless"" mathematics has turned out to have deep connections to branches of physics and to some very applied mathematical disciplines like probability theory and random matrix theory. Thus, for example, alternating-sign matrices are related to ""square ice"", a simplified model for an ice crystal studied by statistical physicists, while at the same time appearing in the study of an algorithm for computing matrix determinants, which are a ubiquituous concept used in practically all the sciences and engineering disciplines. And Young tableaux, which originated with the mathematical study of symmetry, have been found to be related to random matrix theory, an important mathematical theory which has its origins in attempts by nuclear physicists to model the complex interactions in the nuclei of heavy elements. The combination of theoretical elegance and applied utility makes these research topics highly attractive from a scientific standpoint, and also very suitable as the focus for educational activities planned by the investigator, which would have as their goals to attract promising students to mathematics and the sciences and to promote public appreciation of the value of scientific research."
0.25,"Due to its many successes in science and applications, superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) has become an enabling technology for the accelerator-based sciences such as particle physics, nuclear physics and the materials sciences. Nevertheless, there remain technical and scientific challenges to the full realization of the potential of this technology. This award to Cornell will provide support for the study of in situ plasma cleaning of SRF cavities as an effective method to recover and/or improve the medium field Q0 of cavities and to systematically study how thermal cycling of a cavity increases its intrinsic quality factor. The group will use temperature mapping systems and existing single and 9-cell cavities for these studies. Broader impacts of the program are extensive, including impacts across accelerator and materials sciences and student research at the graduate level."
0.45,"Non-technical: <br/><br/>This project elucidates the fundamental properties of solid matter at extreme conditions, such as low dimensions and extremely high magnetic fields. The scientific understanding of the fundamental properties of these materials is crucial for the next generation of electronic devices and a 21st century economy. The project also leads to efficient training of undergraduate and graduate students who will be future leaders in scientific discovery in academia, national labs, and industry. In particular, students are trained on electronic materials, laser science and applications, and high magnetic fields. Minority middle school students in Florida and Alabama are exposed to cutting edge scientific research. <br/><br/>Technical: <br/><br/>This research project will focus on the joint investigation by researchers at the USF and the UAB to elucidate the coherence lifetimes in high mobility modulation doped GaAs\AlGaAs systems. The USF team will perform two-dimensional Fourier transform (2DFT) experiments, which are an enhanced form of coherent four-wave mixing measurements that are similar to the extension of nuclear magnetic resonance to two dimensions. The UAB team will develop a new terahertz frequency spectrometer that will employ well-established techniques to generate high peak power terahertz pulses using nonlinear difference frequency generation in the tilted wavefront configuration and a multiple pulse technique similar to the near infrared 2DFT techniques. Both experiments will use the new Split Helix magnet to perform measurements at 25 T, which was custom-designed by National High Magnetic Field Lab researchers to enable next generation optical measurements. This new magnet will enable the USF-UAB collaboration to study quantum coherence in high mobility electron gases in field ranges that were inaccessible to ultrafast-laser source based experiments.<br/>This project will contribute to our understanding of decoherence mechanisms and both inter- and intra-Landau level coherence, which is critical to their utilization in next generation electronics. The research team is committed to the broad dissemination of the results of this research project through presentations, internationally-attended research conferences, and publication of our results in high impact, peer-reviewed journals. Both USF and UAB researchers are strongly committed to fostering the education of the next generation of condensed matter and high magnetic field researchers. To contribute to these NSF goals, we will directly involve undergraduate, summer REU students, and our graduate students in the design, planning, experiments, data analysis and the from traditionally underrepresented groups from our diverse student bodies."
0.300175,"All of the elements other than hydrogen and helium are created inside of stars by ""nucleosynthesis"" processes. The origin of the material that makes planets - and people - is thus intimately tied to the detailed process that take place within stars. The PI and his collaborators will use novel computational techniques and the most powerful computing resources available to simulate conditions inside the earliest stars in the universe. These simulations will be used to evaluate a postulated, but unexplored, nucleosynthesis mechanism they call the ""i-process"". Graduate students will be trained in cutting-edge stellar modeling and computational astrophysics by one of the world leaders in this field. The potential for probing new forms of nucleosynthesis are of interest to the nuclear physics field as well as to astrophysics. Advanced techniques developed in this program could have applications in other areas of computational science.<br/><br/>The goal of this investigation is to simulate convection and nucleosynthesis processes inside the kind of stars that were present early in the universe. They will develop novel ""autocorrecting"" techniques to couple a 3-D treatment of convection with 1-D stellar evolution models, and they will generate a large database of results and tools to mine this database. These results will be accessible to the larger stellar modeling community, and they will chart new territory in computational astrophysics. These simulations should allow a probe of postulated nucleosynthesis processes that are driven by neutron capture at rates intermediate between the s- and r-processes.<br/><br/>This award is supported jointly by the Computational Physics Program in the Division of Physics and the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences."

The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at Keene State College but also at Saint Anselm College and other neighboring institutions and local industrial partners."
0.115,"An isolated neutron lives for about fifteen minutes before disintegrating into three lighter particles. This fundamental process plays a significant role in cosmology, and its study complements current efforts to discover new physics. Two laboratory techniques exist to determine the lifetime of a neutron with high precision, but they disagree significantly in their reported values. This discrepancy must be addressed in order to realize the potential of these techniques to help probe new physics. The research conducted with this award directly supports that effort by examining the behavior of very low energy (or ""ultracold"") neutrons which are magnetically confined in order to determine the neutron lifetime. The research involves a broad set of ideas and skills appropriate for undergraduate involvement and will be used to form the kernel for an interdisciplinary undergraduate research training, mentoring, and outreach program at Tennessee Technological University. <br/><br/>Research activities will be carried out in conjunction with the UCNtau collaboration, which has constructed a magneto-gravitational ultracold neutron trap with a long intrinsic neutron storage time and demonstrated a detection strategy capable of making multiple high-precision measurements in a single accelerator cycle at the Los Alamos National Laboratory ultracold neutron source. Losses due to spin evolution in this trap will be empirically characterized by developing a high-fidelity spin-tracking Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment which, when combined with measurements of the mean trap lifetime as a function of the polarization-preserving ambient magnetic field magnitude, will be used to characterize indirectly the loss rate associated with spin evolution in the trap, sufficient for completing measurement of the neutron lifetime to an accuracy of one second. Measurements in a dedicated test cell will provide information necessary to assess directly the effect of spin evolution in a very high-precision (well below 0.1%) magnetic trap measurement of the free neutron lifetime."
0.37,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. The proposed research is for two experiments to make precise measurements of an elementary particle called the muon, which is similar to the electron but with larger mass. One experiment at tha Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, called g-2, will measure the magnetic moment of the muon to an accuracy of better than a part-per-million, which will provide a test of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that explains the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the Universe. The other experiment, called MuSun, at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will measure the lifetime of an atom comprised of a muon and a deuteron (a nucleus made from one proton and one neutron). This experiment will further the knowledge of the reaction of thermonuclear hydrogen burning which powers the sun, as well as helping to understand neutrino interactions with matter.<br/><br/>The muon g-2 experiment will measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment to 140 parts-per-billion, a four-fold improvement over the previous experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), known as E821. The measurement will address the longstanding 3 standard deviation discrepancy between the same measurement from E821 and the Standard Model prediction. It represents a key test of the Standard Model and has broad sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model. The muon g-2 project has involved the relocation of the muon storage ring from Brookhaven National Laboratory to Fermilab as well as new detector, electronics and acquisition systems. The PI and his group are responsible for the 8 GByte/sec calorimeter readout, using multi-teraflop GPU-based data processing, and distributed event building for the data acquisition system. The MuSun experiment will measure the mu- d to n n neutrino doublet capture rate to an accuracy of 1.5%. The measurement addresses a longstanding discrepancy among earlier measurements of mu d capture. It will provide a five-fold improvement in our knowledge of the two-body weak axial currents that plays a role in pp thermonuclear fusion, cross sections for neutrino experiments, and ordinary and double beta-decay."

0.31284,"The award includes three projects at Jefferson Lab (JLab): (a) developing a new experiment to measure the proton charge radius with a sub-percent precision; (b) extracting the lifetime of the pi-zero meson with an unprecedented 1.4% precision from the PrimEx-II data set; and (c) developing and preparing the approved experiment to measure the lifetime of the eta meson in the newly developing Hall D. As one of the most fundamental quantities, accurate knowledge of the proton size was always important in physics. Very recently, a new result from a muonic-hydrogen experiment, with its unprecedented less than 0.1% precision, stated that the proton size is up to 7 standard deviations smaller than it was previously known to be. This experimental fact triggered the well-known ""proton radius crisis"" in physics. To address this crisis, a collaboration led by the PI of this award developed a uniquely designed electron-scattering experiment that was approved by PAC38 at JLab with the major condition of developing a new windowless gas hydrogen target. Precision measurements of the light pseudo-scalar meson lifetimes continue to be an important part of this award. The PrimEx collaboration performed the first measurement (PrimEx-I) of the pi-zero meson lifetime with the best precision up to date (2.8% in total). The results have been published and included in the Particle Data Group average. To reach the projected unprecedented 1.4% precision, our collaboration upgraded the experimental setup and performed the second (PrimEx-II) experiment in the fall of 2010. Under this award, the analysis process will be completed, and the results published. Under the leadership of the PI, a award to measure the eta meson lifetime with the best up to now precision (3%) was developed and approved to run in Hall D at JLab. We will prepare this experiment to run for the next few years.<br/><br/>Precise knowledge of the proton size is critically important for understanding of the structure of hadronic matter. In addition, it is very important for atomic physics, in particular, the spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen. The currently developed experimental situation with the proton size limits the determination of the Rydberg constant, one of the basic and the most precisely known constant in physics up to now. The proposed experiment, with its independent novel approach and projected precision, has a direct potential to either significantly shift the current value of the Rydberg constant (if it confirms recent muonic-hydrogen result) or question the sufficiency of the basic theory calculations in muonic-hydrogen system. In the latter case, it may also indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. The lifetimes of the light pseudo-scalar mesons carry direct information about the symmetries, and in particular, their partial breaking effects in the theory of interaction in physics. Therefore, the precise knowledge of these important quantities will serve as benchmark tests to our understanding of Nature. In particular, the anticipated high precision measurement of the eta lifetime will significantly improve the ratio of light quark masses in a direct and most model independent way in physics. The quark masses and their ratios are input into the contemporary particle physics from the experiment. This project will provide advanced and highest scientific training for African-American students in a field where they are currently under-represented."
0.449195,"Strong forces are responsible for the formation of matter as we know it, but the detailed understanding of the underlying mechanism remains a challenge in the physics of hadrons, elementary particles most susceptible to the strong force. The origin of mass and the patterns of resonance phenomena within hadrons can be addressed in principle using ab-initio simulations of the strong force. Yet the connection between simulation data and the physical world represents a major conceptual problem. In this context, this project will develop and apply theoretical and computational methods intended to support the experimental program at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and close the gap between observed phenomena and their explanation from first principles. The PI will also develop a computer programming workshop for local high schools and will develop a course at the George Washington University to provide undergraduates with the skills necessary to analyze data in physics and other disciplines.<br/><br/>The underlying theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), can be simulated using Lattice QCD methods on supercomputers. However, the small volumes probed in these calculations lead to numerical artefacts generally referred to as finite-volume effects. For the three particles case, these effects are not understood. As such, this project aims to develop three-body methods to enable the extrapolation of Lattice QCD results to the physical world and to help answer the fundamental question regarding the QCD predictions for the properties of excited mesons and baryons. The PI and his students will use the Faddeev formalism in the isobar approximation to addresses conceptual challenges such as three-body unitarity. Widely usable analysis tools, designed for minimal model dependence, will be developed and will be applied to the study of systems of high current interest, such as exotics, the X(3872), and the Roper resonance that exhibits notorious problems in QCD simulations."
0.15,"It is well known that nuclei are made from protons and neutrons. In heavy nuclei, there are more neutrons than protons, and this gives rise to the theoretical prediction that heavy nuclei have an outer ""skin"" of neutrons. Measurements of the neutron excess in heavy nuclei also have applications to astrophysics, where objects called neutron stars are known to exist. The thickness of the neutron skin for heavy nuclei bears directly on the theoretical calculations of neutron matter and hence the composition of neutron stars. This award will support research on an experiment that will directly measure the neutron skin thickness, which is poorly known today, with high enough precision to test different theoretical models of neutron matter. A significant fraction of the research will involve undergraduate students from the Temple University community, accompanied by a recruitment effort that seeks to attract students who wish to remain in the city as science teachers. <br/><br/>This experiment relies on a large collaboration of physicists from a number of universities, as well as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Each group plays its part for a successful measurement, and this award supports a specific effort to precisely measure the polarization of the electron beam. This is the fraction of electrons, given one beam setting or another, with spins pointed in one direction as opposed to the other. The goal is to determine the polarization to about 1% accuracy, and this requires careful attention to a number of different details. For example, the technique involves precision determinations of magnetization of thin iron foils in high magnetic fields."
0.55,"The PI will extend extensive studies in numerical linear algebra to the numerical multilinear algebra setting, which complements and enriches the underlying linear framework. The PI's prior work has laid foundations for this new subject via (1) mapping the boundary between the possible and impossible, the computable and non-computable; and (2) extending several matrix notions to tensors (e.g. eigenvalues, singular values, Schatten, Ky Fan norms, Perron-Frobeniuis theorem). This project takes the next step -- developing the requisite algorithms for problems that sit within these boundaries. While almost all 'algorithms' currently in use for tensor problems lack correctness and convergence guarantees, the ones developed for this project strive to be algorithms in the true sense of the word, i.e. meeting the basic requirement of convergence to a true solution and not just a stationary or fixed point. This is in general not possible but the PI will (i) identify large classes of interesting cases for which efficient, provably convergent algorithms exist; and (ii) exploit multilinearity and tap the existing rich collection of linear techniques. These design principles and goals will be applied to algorithmic development of all following problems: (a) Low rank tensor approximations; (b) eigenvalues and singular values for tensors; (c) systems of multilinear equations in the exact and least-squares sense. The PI will also demonstrate the utility of numerical multilinear algebra by proposing several new tools in telecommunications, bioinformatics, and neuroimaging.<br/><br/>Almost all engineering, scientific, and statistical computing problems may ultimately be reduced to a handful of standard problems in linear algebra. <br/>Therefore one may argue that computational linear algebra is the workhorse of computations in science and engineering. This project is about expanding this fundamental arsenal of tools by going from ""linear"" to ""multilinear"". To achieve this, one must first realize that while there are natural extensions of the aforementioned handful of linear problems, there are also subtle difficulties and even impossibilities associated with these multilinear analogues. The crux of the project is to carve out a substantial tractable subclass of problems that are nevertheless still useful in applications. The project would also examine three concrete applications to brain imaging, cellular phone communication, and analytical chemistry."
0.2,"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the microscopic theory of the strong interactions and allows us to understand how hadrons, such as the proton, neutron and pion, are formed through partons, the building blocks of QCD. High-energy scattering processes can be used to explore how partons (quarks and gluons) that come out of a high-energy scattering make a transition into hadrons. While various aspects of these processes are well understood, many striking puzzles remain. Transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) represent one such puzzle. Early QCD calculations predicted basically vanishing effects, but experiments revealed huge SSAs up to 40%. Despite decades of research, the detailed understanding of single-spin asymmetries in QCD is still missing. In this context, this project will explore the role played by the fragmentation of partons for different single-spin asymmetries. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will be involved in this very active field at the frontier of current hadronic physics.<br/><br/>This project will make possible extensive numerical studies of transverse SSAs for single-hadron production in proton-proton collisions, where one of the incoming protons is polarized perpendicular to the reaction plane. These studies will make use of existing analytical results that were developed previously by the investigator and one of his graduate students. Not only is this investigation expected to clarify if parton fragmentation can indeed explain the huge SSAs observed experimentally, but also whether a simultaneous description of SSAs in hadronic collisions and in lepton-induced processes can be obtained. This project is closely related to experiments conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and other accelerator facilities worldwide."
0.208959,"The Standard Model (SM) is a theory that describes fundamental particles in nature and the interactions between them. While the SM has been successful in explaining many phenomena observed in the laboratory to date, it offers no insight into experimental facts such as the dominance of matter over anti-matter, nor the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which are associated with the rotation curves of the galaxies and the accelerated expansion of the universe. Searching for physics beyond the Standard Model is therefore a well-motivated and important task for physicists. A good way to search for new physics is through tests of fundamental symmetries in different interactions.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test fundamental symmetries in the electromagnetic and strong interactions via precision measurements on the properties of neutral particles: neutral pion and eta. The radiative decay width of the neutral pion plays a key role that bridges chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking and our understanding of QCD (a theory describing the strong interaction). On the other hand, the measurement of the eta radiative decay width will reveal the effect of explicit symmetry breakings of chiral symmetry, isospin, and SU(3) by the light-quark masses. In addition, the measurements of branching ratios or upper limits for various rare and forbidden decays of the eta will provide sensitive probes to test the violations of charge conjugation C, parity P, and time reversal T, as well as CP symmetries, and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The results of this project will provide clues to some important questions, such as: ""why is our observed universe dominated by matter over anti-matter?"", and ""what are the masses of the light quarks?""<br/><br/>This project will engage undergraduate students as key contributors. It will create a research-enriched learning environment, explore new approaches to recruiting prospective students, and develop new courses which are research related. Students working in an international collaboration will enhance their international experience and gain global perspectives."
0.43,"It is a well-established fact that protons and neutrons are made up of smaller constituents called quarks and gluons. In collisions using two beams of heavy nuclei, a new state of matter is formed, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This project will answer fundamental questions about the QGP, such as how matter is transformed from a collection of protons and neutrons to a free state where quarks and gluons can travel through space unhindered, much like they did in the primordial soup of matter following the Big Bang. Experiments will be carried out at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located in Geneva, Switzerland. In order to look for signatures of how the transition to the QGP phase has occurred for a given beam energy, the Ohio State group will study the numbers of particles produced in the collisions along with the distribution and correlations of particle momenta. <br/><br/>The goals for the high-energy program are three-fold. Firstly, to study the space-time properties of this extremely dense matter created in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. The second is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory of the Strong interaction between quarks and gluons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies, to probe the transition(s) between confined and deconfined matter. In particular, the group will perform a novel analysis as a function of the collision energy, measuring coordinate-space anisotropies and dynamics. Thirdly, they will take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions, and apply them to proton- proton collisions at similar energies. They will look particularly for collective behavior (flow) in these collisions. If the initial reports of such flow in high-energy p+p collisions are confirmed at higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial self-interacting state, itself. In addition, there are broader impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education, technology and computing."
0.664305,"CAREER: Ultracold molecular ions prepared via sympathetic cooling : a new frontier for quantum interactions and fundamental physics<br/>Eric R. Hudson, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports the development of techniques to open and explore a new frontier in physics: ultracold polar molecular ions. Recent work has shown that by spatially overlapping a cloud of ultracold calcium atoms with a molecular ion trap, it is now possible to produce samples of cooled polar molecular ions. It is expected that samples such as these will lead to significant technological and fundamental advancements, including the study and possible control of chemistry in the quantum regime, the implementation of a scalable quantum computer, new probes of quantum matter and charge transport, understanding the formation of interstellar clouds, and precision measurement of molecular structure for test of fundamental physics. Thus, the main research objective and intellectual merit of this project is to further optimize the methods of cold polar molecular production and begin developing the techniques necessary to enable the expected technological and fundamental advancements.<br/><br/>In concert with this research effort, this CAREER award also supports an effort to increase the broader impact of the work by partnering with the UCLA Graduate School of Education's Center X Science Project to develop a series of inquiry-based, hands-on experiments to help local K-12 schools meet the Science Content Standards for California Public Schools. Center X partners with well over 100 local schools, helping them to improve their curriculum and teaching strategies, but currently needs help in developing relevant, inquiry-based physics experiments. Since research shows that when coursework is coupled with hands-on experience, students learn more effectively, retain knowledge longer, and develop higher-order skills with the added benefit of reaching a diversity of students, this lack of curriculum must be addressed. To combat this deficiency, work under this CAREER award will develop a hands-on laboratory curriculum for high schools students closely tied to the research performed in our laboratory."
0.425,"According to the fundamental theory of how protons and neutrons form atomic nuclei, these particles are expected to melt into a soup of quarks and gluons known as the quark gluon plasma (QGP) at the high densities and temperatures that are created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a new phase of matter has been discovered. With its unprecedented reach in energy, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) explores new regions of this phase transition and will reveal its signatures. The PI's research investigates the properties of this new state of matter at high density and temperature in a quantitative manner through a study of internal probes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>Jets are collimated sprays of decay products of hard-scattered quarks and gluons. Because their expected yields are calculable using the well understood theory of strong interactions, they provide calibrated probes of QGP. Since their propagation through the QGP is affected by strong interactions, an energy loss measurement of jets is an ideal probe to study the key features of this new state of matter. The PI's research group at Rutgers will determine the fundamental properties of this dense and hot matter via various complimentary jet measurements by utilizing the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at LHC. <br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>The PI proposes a three-tiered approach to cultivate a diverse and competitive work force via integration of active research and education. She will encourage female middle and high school students to pursue university education in STEM fields by bringing them to Rutgers for full-day sessions of demos and experiments, recruit undergraduate physics majors by incorporating cutting-edge LHC research into her introductory physics courses and by organizing Women in Physics Conferences at Rutgers, and mentor women and minority students and include them in all phases of research."
1.26,"This award is primarily to carry out experiments with relativistic heavy ion collisions. The principal investigators are T. J. Humanic and M. A. Lisa, of the Department of Physics at The Ohio State University. Our goals for the high-energy program are threefold. Firstly, we will study the space-time properties of the extremely dense matter created at in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. It is believed that this matter is a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), characterized by colored degrees of freedom at the microscopic scale. The second activity is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory of the Strong interaction between partons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies, to probe the transition(s) between confined and deconfined matter. In particular, we plan to perform a novel analysis as a function of the collision energy, measuring coordinate-space anisotropies and dynamics. Thirdly, we will take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions, and apply them to hadronic(p+p) collisions at similar energies. We will look particularly for collective behaviour(flow) in hadronic collisions. If our initial reports of such flow in ultrarelativistic p+p collisions are confirmed at higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial self-interacting state, itself. In the present grant ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions will be studied with Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and with Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. RHIC started delivering Au-Au collisions in Summer 2000, and the LHC, which is the highest energy heavy ion accelerator now in operation, began delivering Pb-Pb collisions at the end of 2010. In order to look for signatures that a phase transition to Quark Matter has taken place, one must study the properties of the particles produced in the collisions, such as particle momenta and multiplicities of each type that can be detected (e.g. pions, kaons, protons, and more exotic particles). This will be done at both RHIC and the LHC using the large acceptance detectors available in the STAR and ALICE experiments, respectively, which can sample most of the interesting particles per collision. The information obtained in this way can be used to determine, for example, the physical size of the interaction region (using two-particle interferometry), the temperatures reached in the collisions (from particle momentum distributions) and exotic particle production such as strange baryons.<br/><br/>Besides the intellectual merit described above, there are broader impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education, technology and computing. Since undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will play key roles in this project, training will be provided to these groups in how to carry out research in large collaborations and in general problem solving skills. Since this research requires large-scale computing in order to acquire and analyze data on the teraflop and terabyte scale, new methods in information science, such as computing grid systems, will be developed, which can enhance the computing power of society as a whole."

The main physics program supported by this award is directed at the study of the quark structure of nucleons and the nuclei that are made up of these nucleons. Research will be carried out at the Fermilab Laboratory near Chicago as part of a collaboration called SeaQuest. This collaboration is focused on the production of pairs of particles called muons, which are like electrons but more massive, used as a probe of the anti-quark distributions in the nucleon (and whether these distributions are modified in nuclei). This information will provide direct input to theoretical models of the proton, and shed light on the origin of the proton's spin. A related study, using a polarized proton beam, will provide new information on symmetries of the quark distributions based on predictions from the fundamental theory of Quantum Chromodynamics. In addition, the Michigan group will lead the operation of the low-temperature hydrogen targets at the SeaQuest experiment, and participate in the development of a polarized hydrogen target for a next-generation experiment. Education and training of both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as outreach aimed at the general public, is an important aspect of this research program.<br/><br/>The SeaQuest experiment at the Fermilab Laboratory near Chicago will provide a better understanding how light anti-quarks are distributed in nucleons and nuclei, on the physical mechanism that generates the sea of the nucleon, and how orbital angular momentum might contribute to the nucleon spin. A smaller, but very important effort will be spent on developing a polarized Drell-Yan program at Fermilab that is complementary to the spin physics programs at Brookhaven National Lab and Jefferson Lab. This program builds on the expertise the group has gained, and is a natural extension of the group's work over the past years. It allows them to play a major role in the Drell-Yan experiment at Fermilab now, and to lead the way towards a polarized Drell-Yan program at Fermilab in the future."
0.36,"This grant supports research to complete the determination of the weak charge of the proton and investigate new aspects of the Standard Model of fundamental matter and interactions. The Standard Model describes three of the four forces of nature in an elegant manner; those three forces are the electromagnetic interaction, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction. The weak charge of the proton is a basic property, like its electric charge and mass, which determines the proton's response to the weak interaction. It is also related to how the weak and electromagnetic interactions mix with each other. Because the Standard Model predicts how that mixing varies with the amount of momentum that is exchanged in an interaction, a precise measurement of the proton's weak charge at a low value of momentum transfer is a rigorous test of the Standard Model. Additionally, it is sensitive to physics not yet included in the Standard Model. The research program of this award also includes measurements of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering that is sensitive to charge symmetry breaking at the quark level and further extends our understanding of<br/>fundamental interactions.<br/><br/>The research group supported by this grant will re-commission the Mott polarimeter at Jefferson Lab. That polarimeter will measure the alignment of electron spins in the electron beam of Jefferson Lab; knowing that alignment is crucial to providing polarized electron beams to the four experimental halls of the Lab. Both hardware and software issues will be addressed in this project so the student and postdoctoral researchers will gain a wide range of valuable skills. These broader impacts on the polarized program of Jefferson Lab and the training of young scientists are interwoven into the research program."

0.9975,"This award will enable the group to continue a comprehensive program in neutrino-less double-beta decay (NDBD). The intellectual merit of this activity is based on the fact that NDBD is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton number conservation, an important symmetry in elementary-particle physics. If indeed neutrinos are Majorana particles, a measurement of the NDBD half-life would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. Combined with neutrino oscillation data, it would determine all three neutrino mass eigenvalues. Leptogenesis in the early universe is only possible if there are Majorana neutrinos. The laboratory observation and measurement of NDBD would be transformative of elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The group is working on two NDBD experiments: CUORE and MAJORANA. USC has the major tasks of the procurement, production, installation, and maintenance of the front-end CUORE electronic system from the detector to the data acquisition system, and is involved in the construction and operation of CUORE-0, the first tower of CUORE. USC leads a major Task in the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR R&D which has the responsibility for the procurement of enriched germanium oxide, its reduction to metal, zone refinement to detector quality metal, and reprocessing of scrap material.

The activity supported by this award centers on an innovative program to develop theoretical tools for the analysis of correlations in a hydrodynamic context. Applications of this framework to transverse-momentum fluctuation data already provide a first estimate of the shear viscosity.<br/><br/>RHIC experiments exhibit a striking ""ridge"" of enhanced correlations that has garnered substantial interest. This ridge occurs both with and without a jet trigger, and is part of a rich correlation landscape. We propose to apply our hydrodynamic framework to understand this landscape at RHIC and LHC. These efforts promise to reveal information on both early stages of particle production - the glasma - as well as the later period of hydrodynamic evolution. This and similar work is driven by data analyzed at Wayne State. Close collaboration with these experimenters puts this theory group in an excellent position to understand and influence such analyses.<br/><br/>The colliders RHIC and LHC smash nuclei together, producing a tiny fleeting soup of elementary particles called the quark-gluon plasma.

The University of Michigan group has shifted its effort from fundamental neutron physics with expertise in neutron polarization and precision neutron polarimetry to the problem of measurement of the muon-storage ring magnetic field. This expertise and experience in precision spin-precession and NMR-based magnetometry with polarized 3He will be applied to the problem of absolute calibration of the magnetic field measurement system and determining the systematic errors on the field measurement. In particular, this research will fund: 1) development of NMR techniques and systematics of the NMR-based magnetic-field measurement system and 2) work towards an absolute measurement of the 3He magnetic moment in a Penning trap.

This will result in a determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy with a precision comparable to the best determinations from high energy colliders. It would have excellent sensitivity to many beyond the Standard Model scenarios. During the period of this grant, our group will contribute to the development of this experiment by working on beam charge and position monitor upgrades, luminosity monitor and background detector development and construction, and simulation design studies."
0.135,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this award is to measure the quark structure of light particles called mesons. The proposed research will support the research infrastructure by commissioning new equipment to produce linearly a beam of high-energy photons from scattered electrons produced by the accelerator at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). The research will also include computer simulations of the particle detector in Hall D at Jefferson Lab. Participation of students in the research effort is a central component of this program.<br/><br/>The experimental program proposed here embodies one of Jefferson Lab's priorities: to elucidate the underlying structure of protons, neutrons, and mesons. The particles of interest here are called hybrid mesons, which are identified as having quantum numbers not allowed in the constituent quark model, due to extra degrees of freedom provided by gluons, which are the force-carriers of the strong force. The discovery of hybrid mesons would be a triumph of modern theoretical models based on the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This award will also provide support for personnel to commission the linearly polarized photon beam and the electron tagger as part of the GlueX experiment In Hall D of Jefferson Lab."
0.921,"Measurements of the solar neutrino spectrum have already yielded unexpected results of fundamental importance and, as these measurements improve, new results promise to be equally revealing. Neutrino oscillations, coupled with the MSW mechanism, are required to explain the observed neutrino fluxes at Earth. This solution allows an interesting region between vacuum- and matter-enhanced oscillations where additional new physics can be probed. Likewise, recent solar abundance measurements have created conflicts between the Standard Solar Model and helioseismology results, which are most sensitively resolved by measurement of the CNO neutrino flux. Significantly, there also remains the question whether the luminosity of the sun, as determined by photons, accurately matches the luminosity as determined by neutrinos. In this case, a direct measurement of the pp neutrinos is also required. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for this group to continue their participation in the science arena of Borexino in the underground laboratory at Gran Sasso, Italy as the collaboration focuses on measuring the Beryllium-7 neutrino flux. The group actively participated and provided expert manpower to Borexino purification efforts. Results from the first pass of purification have been very successful, and when completed in the coming year, Borexino looks well poised to provide meaningful measurements of the CNO and pep fluxes as well. Future possibilities include measurements of the pp neutrino flux with the LENS experiment. <br/><br/>This award will provide excellent training of, and experience for, the students and postdocs who work in the program as well as potential applications of these technologies outside of the field."
0.043,"The main physics program supported by this award is to search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron, which if found would signal new physics beyond the physics of the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the existence and properties of the principal elementary constituents of known matter. The search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is one of the primary goals of physics in the 21st century. The experiment, called the neutron Electric Dipole Moment (nEDM), will be carried out at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, using instruments constructed and tested by a consortium of institutions. Construction of the detector and the data taking will take place in the next few years, providing first hand experience in cutting edge research for undergraduates at Valparaiso University.<br/><br/>Precision measurement of the properties of the neutron presents an opportunity to search for violations of fundamental symmetries and to make critical tests of the validity of the Standard Model. The Standard Model nearly prohibits the existence of a permanent electric dipole moment of the neutron, whereas extensions to the Standard Model predict an electric dipole moment of the neutron at varying strengths that are potentially attainable by this experiment. The discovery of a nEDM would imply a violation of time reversal invariance and a violation of charge-parity symmetry that, depending on its magnitude, has implications for the particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the universe. Measurements of the particle electric dipole moment provide some of the tightest constraints on extensions to the Standard Model. The experiment is designed to improve the sensitivity by a factor of 100 compared to previous experiments."
0.163402,"This research focuses on two areas: (i) the description of hadron properties in terms of their constituent quarks and gluons, and (ii) the production of strangeness and charm in antiproton-proton interactions. (i) A hybrid approach will be used to describe hadron properties in terms of both perturbative and non-perturbative processes. A statistical model will represent perturbative degrees of freedom, and a meson cloud model will represent the nonperturbative fluctuation of baryons into meson-baryon states. A study of the pion-nucleon form factor will reduce the model-dependence of pion cloud contributions to this and other hadron structure calculations. This project will address one of the outstanding challenges to theory posed by recent experiment, the momentum-dependence of light quark distributions in the proton sea, and determine the parton contributions to strangeness and spin in the proton. Predictions will be made for experiments running at Fermilab and planned at JPARC. (ii) The creation of antihyperon-hyperon pairs in antiproton-proton annihilations tests theoretical models for the description of strangeness and charm production. Quark model calculations and reaction matrix analyses of these reactions will be made and compared to meson-exchange and constituent quark models, and to recent spin transfer measurement results from CERN, which disagree with all theoretical calculations. Cross sections and spin observables will be calculated for the experiments planned by the PANDA collaboration at FAIR, which will extend the CERN measurements to higher energies and to the production of charmed hyperons. <br/><br/>Nucleons (protons and neutrons) and other hadrons are particles composed of quarks, gluons, and a fluctuating sea of quark-antiquark pairs. In this research we study the fundamental questions of how the properties of a particle are determined by the properties of its constituents, and how those constituents affect the ways in which particles interact with one another. An example of this type of question is proton spin. The proton spin is 1/2, but it consists of many quarks (spin 1/2) and gluons (spin 1). How do all these spins add up to give us a spin-1/2 proton? This work will be carried out with undergraduate research assistants from Seattle University. Their research experience will provide an integration of classroom learning and the excitement of contemporary research. Students will receive training in research methods and scientific communication. They will work in teams, mentor younger students and present their work in papers, posters and talks at meetings of professional societies. They will also share their work with the local campus community in seminars and events sponsored by Seattle University student research organizations."
0.475,"In the quest to understand the fundamental structure of matter, most physicists have taken a reductionist approach by breaking down matter into its elementary constituents: electrons, quarks, gluons, etc. In addition to these known elementary particles that constitute the Standard Model of particle physics (our current best theory of the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions), there may exist more as-of-yet undiscovered elementary particles.<br/><br/>This project supports efforts to precisely measure so-called electroweak properties of the proton and of the electron in two large experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). Discrepancies between these measurements and the predictions of the Standard Model will point to new physical processes that are not yet included in the Standard Model. In case of agreement certain extensions to the Standard Model will be ruled out.<br/><br/>Precision electroweak measurements present a unique approach to test the Standard Model of particle physics at low-energy electron accelerators. Jefferson Lab is currently the world's leading laboratory for these parity-violating electron scattering experiments, and is uniquely suited to complete the ambitious Qweak and MOLLER experiments. The results of both experiments, by themselves but especially in combination with the results from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, will allow us to constrain models of physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The Qweak experiment started in May 2010 and collected data until May 2012. The experiment has performed the first determination of the weak charge of the proton with only 5% of the available data, and is aiming to make a precision measurement sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model with the full data set. The investigators will continue their central role in the track reconstruction, data analysis, and simulation efforts crucial to the successful completion of the experiment. The MOLLER experiment is expected to run as early as 2017, and will measure the electroweak mixing angle to a precision comparable to the best available high-energy measurements through a measurement of the weak charge of the electron. The investigators will take a leading role in the development of the track reconstruction detectors for the MOLLER experiment, and the development of a novel type of electron beam polarimeter based on Moller scattering in polarized atomic hydrogen gas. This new polarimeter will allow the measurement of the electron polarization to the required precision of 0.4% using a technique that will be applicable at other electron accelerators as well.<br/><br/>The investigators are working to increase economic and racial diversity in physics through specific recruiting efforts for the William & Mary REU program. The investigators are committed to increasing interaction between the physics department and the broader community through the organization of ""PhysicsFest,"" a yearly physics department open house, and through ""Saturday Morning Physics,"" a regular public outreach lecture series aimed at local middle and high school students."
0.133631,"The goal of this project is to test fundamental symmetries in the electromagnetic and strong interactions. By doing precise measurements of the properties of low-mass neutral mesons at Jefferson Lab, this research aims at understanding Nature by providing clues to some fundamental questions, such as: (1) Why are quarks confined inside of hadrons?; (2) What are the masses of the light quarks?; (3) Why is the observed universe dominant by matter over anti-matter?; and (4) What is dark matter? This project will also offer great opportunities to engage undergraduate students in cutting edge research. It will create a research-enriched learning environment, explore new approaches to recruiting prospective students, and develop new courses that are research-related. <br/><br/>The PI will play a leadership role as a spokesperson for the experiments: (1) completing data analysis of a precision measurement of the neutral pion lifetime; (2) optimizing and preparing an approved experiment to measure the radiative decay width of the eta meson; (3) commissioning and operating a new pair spectrometer in Hall D and taking data on eta-meson decay in parallel with the GlueX experiment; and (4) leading the development of the Jefferson Lab ""Eta Factory"" program. Measurements of various rare and forbidden decays of the eta mesons will provide sensitive probes for possible existence of new forces, which will extend our knowledge to the dark matter and explore new sources of CP violation needed to explain the matter and anti-matter asymmetry in the universe. The discovery of such new forces beyond Standard Model would have far-ranging implications to advance our understanding of nature."
0.3,"This grant partially supports neutrino research at the University of South Carolina (USC). The group studies the properties of the neutrino, the most prolific particle in the universe, about which much is still unknown. The primary effort is the search for the hypothesized, but not yet discovered, nuclear-radioactive decay called zero-neutrino double-beta decay. The existence of such a radioactive decay mode has important consequences. Its existence requires that neutrinos have mass, and that they are their own anti-particles. Most importantly, this process would require the violation of an important fundamental conservation law of elementary particle physics. The USC group has leadership roles in two of the leading experiments in this field: the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, and the Cryogenic Underground Observatory (CUORE) in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. The spin-off technology from the required radiopurity of materials for the ultra-low background detectors has transitioned directly into Homeland Security. Four past USC PhD students from the program hold important positions in Homeland Security, at the Pacific Northwest and Savannah River National Laboratories. <br/><br/><br/>CUORE, nearing completion in the LNGS, is an array of 988 tellurium oxide single-crystal bolometers that operate at ~8-10 mK to search for the zero-neutrino decay of tellurium-130 (Te-130); the detector will contain 200-kg of Te-130. The predicted half-life sensitivity is ~10^(26) years, to reach into the inverted hierarchy neutrino-mass region. USC leads part of the R&D to determine the feasibility and cost of enriching CUORE to 93% in Te-130 from 33.4%, and equipping the bolometers with Cherenkov-light detectors to discriminate against alpha-particle background. These upgrades are designed to reach the sensitivity required to cover the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. USC leads the CUORE data analysis to search for zero-neutrino double-beta decay of Te-130 to the first excited 0+ state in xenon-130, by detecting the coincidence events from the two electrons and cascade gamma rays. This technique achieved zero-background in the prototype experiment, CUORICINO. Finally, the USC group was responsible for the production of the CUORE front-end electronics, and will participate in its installation, commissioning and maintenance."
0.09,"The electroweak standard model describes two of the four fundamental forces present in the universe. By conducting experiments that probe with increasing sensitivity phenomena that can be described with this model, it is hoped discrepancies will appear that will lead to a more complete understanding of the weak interaction which is responsible for the decay, or transformation, of the neutron into a proton, electron and antineutrino. Among the measurements that can be made involving neutron decay are correlations between the properties of the neutron and its decay products. One of these correlations, known as little ""a"", involves the direction of emission of the electron and antineutrino from the decay region. Other neutron decay correlations are known to within 1%, but little ""a"" is only known to 4%. After several years of planning and construction, the aCORN (""a"" CORrelation in Neutron decay) collaboration is in the process of collecting data on the fundamental physics beamline at the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). This grant will provide support that will allow DePauw University undergraduate students and the Principal Investigator to continue participating in the experiment."
0.06,"A fundamental goal of subatomic physics is the precise determination of the physical properties of subatomic particles such as the proton and neutron. The radius of the proton is one of these properties. The radius can be measured by scattering electrons, or heavier particles called muons, off protons. Another technique is to measure the energy levels of hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton plus an electron, or muonic hydrogen, an atom consisting of a proton with the electron replaced by a muon. To date, the radius has been measured by scattering of electrons off protons, and by the energy levels of hydrogen and muonic hydrogen. The proton radius derived from the measurement of the energy levels in muonic hydrogen disagrees with the radius derived from the measurements of the energy levels in hydrogen, and with the measurements of the proton radius by scattering of electrons, an issue known as ""the proton radius puzzle."" The discrepancy has attracted wide attention, because it may indicate the existence of previously unobserved and unexpected differences between the interactions of muons and electrons. <br/><br/>A dedicated MUon proton Scattering Experiment (MUSE), which will run at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and directly compare the scattering of muons and electrons from protons, is highly anticipated by experts in the field for its potential to resolve the puzzle. This project will cover the prototyping and development of several crucial components of the MUSE experiment detectors. The project will involve the training of students and young scientists, at the undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and junior faculty levels. The institutions involved in the project have trained large numbers of students of each type, including from minority populations. The training they have received in the process of doing basic research has led to careers in a variety of areas, from medical physics to national security, in addition to continued work in fundamental physics research. The MUSE experiment will broaden the perspective of American students by having them work in an international collaboration at an international laboratory, which will prepare them effectively to become prominent global scientists of the next generation. With the broad interest in the proton radius puzzle, MUSE has the potential to be broadly inspirational beyond the current scientific community."
0.09,"It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is directed at the study of the quark structure of nucleons and nuclei. Research will be carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory as part of a collaboration called STAR. This collaboration is focused on the scattering of high energy polarized protons from nuclei with the goal of understanding the structure of the proton. The proposed research will use the forward electromagnetic calorimeter, called FMS, which is part of the STAR detector system to measure neutral particles that are produced at small scattering angles. The measured rates of such particle production have been found to depend strongly on the direction of polarization of the proton beam, an effect that has confounded attempts at a theoretical understanding based on the fundamental theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Further studies of this particles detected using the FMS will guide future theoretical develpments and help us to understand more about the quark and gluon structure of nucleons.<br/><br/>This proposal supports the Penn State group to operate the FMS detector in the STAR experiment for polarized proton RHIC runs and to analyze data from those runs. The STAR FMS is an electromagnetic calorimeter that detects collision fragments produced in the forward pseudo-rapidity region. Particles observed in this region are associated with the interactions of the most energetic and most polarized quarks. For transversely polarized protons, the large dependence of the cross section on the sign of polarization is a long-standing mystery. While the QCD Lagrangian is known, our ability to use it to predict observables is still limited. In contrast to the electromagnetic force, where the role of spin constituents of an atom is fairly well understood, the role of spin among the partons (constituents of a bound state proton) remains near our knowledge frontier. The most useful model for scattering by the QCD force is perturbative QCD, or pQCD, which is applicable when the collisions between protons constituents exchange large momentum. The goal of this research is to determine experimentally where pQCD applies and how to modify models to extend applicability."
0.185,"Precise experimental tests of fundamental particle properties are now a well-established way to search for new laws of nature beyond our current physical knowledge. The proposed research is for two experiments to make precise measurements of an elementary particle called the muon, which is similar to the electron but with larger mass. One experiment at tha Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, called g-2, will measure the magnetic moment of the muon to an accuracy of better than a part-per-million, which will provide a test of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that explains the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the Universe. The other experiment, called MuSun, at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will measure the lifetime of an atom comprised of a muon and a deuteron (a nucleus made from one proton and one neutron). This experiment will further the knowledge of the reaction of thermonuclear hydrogen burning which powers the sun, as well as helping to understand neutrino interactions with matter.<br/><br/>The muon g-2 experiment will measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment to 140 parts-per-billion, a four-fold improvement over the previous experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), known as E821. The measurement will address the longstanding 3 standard deviation discrepancy between the same measurement from E821 and the Standard Model prediction. It represents a key test of the Standard Model and has broad sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model. The muon g-2 project has involved the relocation of the muon storage ring from Brookhaven National Laboratory to Fermilab as well as new detector, electronics and acquisition systems. The PI and his group are responsible for the 8 GByte/sec calorimeter readout, using multi-teraflop GPU-based data processing, and distributed event building for the data acquisition system. The MuSun experiment will measure the mu- d to n n neutrino doublet capture rate to an accuracy of 1.5%. The measurement addresses a longstanding discrepancy among earlier measurements of mu d capture. It will provide a five-fold improvement in our knowledge of the two-body weak axial currents that plays a role in pp thermonuclear fusion, cross sections for neutrino experiments, and ordinary and double beta-decay."

While the theory known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has become accepted as describing the strong interaction, which binds the constituent quarks and gluons in the nucleon, numerous questions still remain about the quark spatial and momentum distributions. The principle investigator and students will take a leading role in the first experiment to take place at Jefferson Lab after the recent upgrade, with the goal of measuring the quark spatial and momentum distributions in the nucleon, called the F_2 structure function. These distributions will be compared with predictions from models of the nucleon inspired by QCD theory. In addition to the scientific focus the research program will address a critical need for training of the next generation of physicists. As part of an Historically Black College or University, the graduate physics program at Hampton University broadly supports the education and training of both undergraduate and graduate students<br/>from this under-represented group. This project will continue to provide access to advanced, internationally-competitive, scientific training for these students.<br/><br/>This research will study the transition from the momentum transfer region in which the quarks are asymptotically free to the region in which the quarks are bound into mesons and baryons. This will be accomplished through experiments to measure the proton magnetic form factor, GMp , and the F_2 inclusive structure function of the proton, neutron, and deuteron at large momentum transfer with significantly better precision than currently available. The project will additionally support required preparations for a later-to-run Hall B experiment to measure the F_2 structure function of the nearly free neutron in the poorly understood large x regime, and which was chosen by the Jefferson Lab Program Advisory Committee for the ""High Impact"" designation."
0.495,"Proton high energy structure and the high energy proton-proton interaction depend on the spin and angular momentum of the underlying quarks and gluons. Unique tools are available at the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), which make it possible to study the role of the spin of the proton constituents in polarized proton collisions. RHIC is the first high energy polarized proton collider, where experimentalists can prepare the spin orientation of high energy protons before they collide. These polarized proton collisions are studied in the STAR detector with center of mass energies up to 500 GeV. When relativistic protons collide, they produce high energy fragments including neutral pions, etas and jets of particles. It is in the very forward region where particle production is most sensitive to the orientation of the proton spin. This research involves measurement of forward fragments in relativistic proton-proton collisions. In particular, transverse spin dependence is studied using a lead-glass calorimeter called the FMS, which is located in the forward region of the STAR detector. The goal is to characterize the dependence of this production on event kinematics. We test QCD related predictions of how the spin of the proton correlates with the spin of quarks and how this can modify the observable cross sections. This grant supports the collection of new RHIC FMS data and the analysis of that data. The objective is better understanding of the most basic questions about the nature of the proton.<br/><br/><br/>The proton is understood to consist of quarks and gluons bound together by the strong force. This project investigates the role quark spin plays in the structure of the proton. This investigation involves the construction and ongoing operation of the FMS calorimeter in the STAR detector at Brookhaven National Lab. The FMS apparatus is available to all the other collaborators in STAR. The over 500 STAR collaborators work on a diverse range of physics topics, many of which are enhanced by the presence of the FMS. This research involves participation of undergraduate students who assist in fabrication of electronics and in analysis of data from the experiment.

1.2,"With this award, the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Materials Research is funding Professors Hai-Ping Cheng, George Christou, and Xiaoguang Zhang at the University of Florida to study how to make magnetic materials with some of the smallest dimensions possible. Magnetic materials are important for the electronics industry and the ongoing trend towards miniaturization of devices, has made the development of ever-smaller magnets essential. The team is studying what are termed single-molecule magnets; these are individual molecules that function as magnets yet are smaller than those of traditional magnetic materials. The team is using advanced computational methods to predict which structures will yield the optimal magnetic properties and they are also studying ways to attach the single-molecule magnets to a surface to introduce certain effects crucial to the potential use of these materials in new technologies. The project is providing multi-disciplinary training to the participating graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, research opportunities for high school students through the University of Florida's Summer Student Training Program, and outreach to the general public through the including ""Chemistry Day at the Mall"" activity.<br/><br/>The team led by Professor Cheng has demonstrated from first-principles calculations that the quantum capacitance of a small molecule or nanocluster depends upon its magnetic or geometric configuration. In this project they are now focusing on synthesizing high nuclearity manganese carboxylate clusters with various ligands and correlating the structures with the self-capacitance of the clusters and the magnetic field needed for a low-spin state to a high-spin state transition. The group is using first-principles calculations to predict the effects of changing carboxylate ligands on the magnetic states of high nuclearity manganese clusters and the effects of support surfaces (e.g. boron nitride) on the magnetic and electronic properties of these clusters. The systems are being synthesized, and various scanning tunneling microscopy, spectroscopic and electrochemical studies are being used to characterize the ""charging"" properties of the nanoclusters. By searching through the three basic ""genes,"" the molecule/cluster, the ligands, and the supporting substrate, the group is quantifying and characterizing how different combinations impact properties, and finding the best combination that produces the largest effect and is most suitable for applications."
0.705,"Intellectual Merit: Regulation of gene expression is critical to all cellular processes, from development to environmental response. One way to silence gene expression is by chromatin modifications that prevent transcription. Such transcriptional gene silencing can be induced by small RNAs in association with Argonaute proteins. This presents a conundrum, because by definition, chromatin modification must occur in the nucleus, but many Argonaute proteins are found in the cytoplasm. The role of cytoplasmic accumulation of nuclear-acting Argonaute proteins is unclear, but might reflect regulation of Argonaute action, or relate to transport of small RNAs between cells. This project will exploit the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the subcellular localization of small RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing, in particular how ARGONAUTE 4 and RNA Polymerase IV-dependent small RNAs are spatially distributed within a cell and how this relates to their functions within and between cells. Because the molecular function of small RNAs and Argonautes are conserved in many species, investigating the localization of ARGONAUTE 4 at the protein, cellular, and organismal levels, this research will create mechanistic paradigms that could be applicable to gene silencing in many species. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research offers outstanding training for a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, who will utilize advanced genomic and bioinformatics tools as well as traditional molecular and genetic analyses. An undergraduate student will also be included in the research environment, simultaneously advancing his or her own education and creating mentoring opportunities for the graduate student and postdoctoral fellow.

0.105,"The study of atomic collisions provides important information about one of the fundamental forces of nature. The results of atomic collisions research are widely used in fields such as plasma physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and many other areas. In addition to providing a better overall understanding of heavy-ion collisions, which is the principal focus of the effort, this work will bring a well-known technique from other areas of physics into atomic and molecular collisions research, and possibly lead to additional overlap and collaborations between the atomic collisions community and other related fields. Another important aspect of this project is the inclusion of undergraduate students in cutting-edge research. By participating in this project, students will gain valuable hands-on research experience through code development and data analysis. They will also present their results at regional and national conferences, which will hopefully give them a more global view of scientific research.<br/><br/>The few-body problem is one of the most fundamental, unsolved problems in physics. When more than two particles interact through the Coulomb force, the dynamics of the system cannot be described exactly. As a result, theory must resort to approximations, and any discrepancies that result between theory and experiment must be a result of the approximations. A comparison of current theoretical models with recent experimental results reveals some striking limitations of the current models. In particular, the dynamics of collisions in which some of the collision fragments are found in a full 3-dimensional geometry is not understood. The underlying mechanism behind these 3-dimensional collisions is known to be a result of quantum mechanical effects, but current theories cannot accurately describe the collision dynamics. The objective of this project is to develop a novel quantum mechanical theoretical model for the study of ion-impact atomic collisions through the use of the path integral technique. The path integral method is a well-known technique used in other areas of physics, but has not been applied to the study of heavy-ion collisions. This particular technique will allow for the inclusion of important quantum mechanical interactions, as well as provide an intuitive understanding of particle trajectories during the collision. <br/><br/>The technical details of the project include the development of a computational model using the path integral method for ionization and capture processes with heavy-ion projectiles. The method will utilize an expansion of the Lagrangian around the classical path, where the deviation from the classical path represents the quantum fluctuations of the particle. For electron capture collisions, the role of the projectile-nuclear interaction and target electron correlation will be studied. Electron capture collisions with high projectile energy and large scattering angle will also be studied with the objective of better understanding the Thomas mechanism, and determining if possible diffraction effects exist in these collisions. For ionization processes, collisions in which the ejected electron is found outside of the scattering plane will be studied, with a focus on projectile-nuclear interactions and the role of close collisions between the projectile and the target nucleus."
0.326,"Evidence is mounting that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a sub-nuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a cosmic gravitational-wave background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale of Inflation. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with an amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor to scalar modes, r = T/S. Many slow-roll models of Inflation produce r ~ 0.01?0.1, corresponding to peak CMB fluctuations of 30?100 nK rms on degree angular scales. Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey described the search for the CGB as ""the most exciting quest of all"", and emphasized that ""mid-term investment is needed for systems aimed at detecting the (B-mode) polarization of the CMB"". In 2005, the Task Force on CMB Research identified this as the highest priority for the field and established a target sensitivity of r = 0.02. The ongoing BICEP/BICEP2/SPUD series of experiments is dedicated to this science goal. They began operating at the South Pole Station (Antarctica) in 2006 and are relentlessly mapping an 800-deg2 region of the sky that uniquely low in Galactic foregrounds - the so-called Southern Hole. The combined sensitivity at 150 GHz (now greater than that of the Planck spacecraft) is concentrated on the Southern Hole increasing the ability to detect the CGB significantly. This award will support for three years the science observations and analysis with a new CMB polarimeter called BICEP3 - a third-generation compact refractor that will represent another breakthrough in per-receiver sensitivity. BICEP3 provides a further ten-fold increase in optical throughput compared to a single BICEP2/SPUD receiver. Populated with 2560 TESs at 95 GHz over three years of observing, BICEP3 will produce the most sensitive degree-scale CMB polarization maps of 95 GHz of any current or planned experiment. BICEP3 observations, when combined with SPUD's deep 150 GHz and 220 GHz coverage, will provide significantly more powerful discrimination between CMB polarization and Galactic foregrounds. Detection of the CGB would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB was to the Big Bang. Indeed its impact might be even broader, as Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science."

The combined sensitivity at 150 GHz (now greater than that of the Planck spacecraft) is concentrated on the Southern Hole increasing the ability to detect the CGB significantly. This award will support for three years the science observations and analysis with a new CMB polarimeter called BICEP3 - a third-generation compact refractor that will represent another breakthrough in per-receiver sensitivity. BICEP3 provides a further ten-fold increase in optical throughput compared to a single BICEP2/SPUD receiver. Populated with 2560 TESs at 95 GHz over three years of observing, BICEP3 will produce the most sensitive degree-scale CMB polarization maps of 95 GHz of any current or planned experiment. BICEP3 observations, when combined with SPUD's deep 150 GHz and 220 GHz coverage, will provide significantly more powerful discrimination between CMB polarization and Galactic foregrounds. Detection of the CGB would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB was to the Big Bang. Indeed its impact might be even broader, as Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science."
0.498926,"This project will promote studies of the genome of an economically important red alga, Porphyra (""nori"", ""laver""), which is a current sequencing project at the Joint Genome Institute (DOE). Analysis of the Porphrya genome will include comparative studies with genomes of closely related and derived groups (e.g., other red algae, green algae, dinoflagellates). The overall goal of this project is to establish a network of investigators whose members will provide the highest quality public dissemination of the Porphyra genome for use by researchers worldwide, while fostering new collaborations that will lead to experimental application of the genomic data. It is anticipated that RCN-aided use of the Porphyra genome will lead to new understanding of nuclear-organelle co-evolution, studies of nitrogen and carbon metabolism in photosynthetic organisms, comparative investigations of how multicellular complexity arose independently in different eukaryotic groups, and the generation of a wealth of new markers for studies in molecular evolution and systematics. The RCN will meet annually, with continued work among participants throughout the year. Each annual meeting will include formal bioinformatics training, evaluation of the overall quality of genome annotation, and research reports and discussions on cross-genomic and experimental applications of the genomic data. The RCN will include many students and postdoctoral fellows who will form a group of genomics-competent young researchers organized around central questions that will impact key societal needs including multitrophic aquaculture (e. g., bioremediation) and an integrated analysis of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments as they affect carbon metabolism on our warming planet. The website will include genome-related lessons for K-12 and college instructors, and the RCN will sponsor public convocations and professional symposia that will present the many contributions of the genome project while highlighting the diversity of scientists engaged in this work."
0.018526,"The South American Andes are among the most species-rich and imperiled hotspots of biodiversity on Earth. Conservation of this region is especially important given its high level of species endemism; of the 45,000 species of plants native to the tropical Andes, nearly half are found nowhere else in the world. In order to effectively conserve this diversity, it is critical to understand the relationships among species as well as how those species form with respect to time and space. However, such an understanding is lacking for many plant groups in this region. This research aims to improve our understanding of diversity in the genus Phlegmariurus, a widespread group of ancient land plants that are represented by approximately 100 species in the high mountains of the Andes, by identifying how hybridization and genome doubling led to the formation of new species in the group. This research provides funding for the researchers to collect these plants in forests and alpine grasslands in Colombia and Ecuador and to use newly developed DNA sequencing technologies to resolve the evolutionary history of this ancient and ecologically prominent group of plants. Further, this funding will allow the researchers to disseminate their results through national and international meetings and peer-reviewed scientific publications, and to train undergraduate students in cutting-edge molecular biology techniques.<br/><br/>Species relationships and the evolutionary signature of hybridization in tropical American Phlegmariurus will be inferred using an approach that combines DNA sequencing and genome size estimation via flow cytometry. To supplement materials previously collected in Central America, the researchers will collect leaf material from plants in the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. Dried leaf material will be used both to extract DNA for sequencing and to infer genome size using flow cytometry. Four nuclear-encoded genes, which can be used to infer if a species is of hybrid origin, will be sequenced using the recently developed sequencing approach on the Pacific Biosciences next-generation DNA sequencing platform. By combining this approach with genome size estimation via flow cytometry, the researchers will be able to identify the number of species in the group that originated from inter-species hybridization and subsequent genome doubling (polyploidization). Using computational phylogenetic methods, the researchers will infer the age of lineages in the genus, the evolutionary relationships among species in the group, and the impact of hybridization on rates of species diversification. These results will not only provide insight into the evolutionary relationships among American species of Phlegmariurus, but improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of species diversity in the Andean conservation hotspot."
0.6,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying plant responses to changing environmental conditions is critical to improving agriculture. Plant growth is responsive to seasonal changes in day length, however, our understanding of factors that participate in this photoperiodic control of growth is incomplete. This proposal aims to investigate the function of a newly identified protein that is a key regulator of plant growth in response to photoperiod. The knowledge gained from this work will provide valuable insight into understanding the mechanisms that tie together light sensing, day length measurement, and growth under multiple conditions. This information will contribute to our ability to better anticipate plant responses to the environment. This proposal will also support the development and distribution of a low-cost, open-source plant-imaging platform based on Raspberry-Pi microcomputer systems to high schools as part of an effort to bring science into the local community. A benefit from this Broader Impacts activity is the potential for the public to develop innovative systems for continual, automated monitoring of plant growth. This work will transform our ability to understand plant responses to seasonal changes in the environment, contributing to the long-term goal of improving agriculture.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms that couple light signaling with the circadian clock to regulate growth under changing photoperiodic conditions. This project will investigate the factors that modulate light signaling pathways in association with the circadian clock to regulate growth in response to the environment in a photoperiod-dependent manner. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify circadian clock-associated components, a new protein was identified that directly binds to both clock and light signaling factors, named MASS SPEC IDENTIFIED MODULATING GROWTH FACTOR 1 (MMF1). MMF1 is a conserved, plant-specific, nuclear-localized factor that regulates hypocotyl elongation in a day-length specific manner. This study aims to determine the mechanisms by which MMF1 modulates growth responses by combining physiology, genetics, biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and expression analysis to gain comprehensive understanding into the role of MMF1 in plants. Preliminary data, based on mass spectrometry results, direct interaction assays, genetics, hypocotyl elongation assays, and gene expression analysis, suggest a key role for MMF1 in modulating growth in a day-length dependent manner. The aims of this proposal are to 1) determine the role of MMF1 in the regulation of growth and physiology in a light- and photoperiod-dependent manner, 2) identify the genetic and biochemical bases underlying MMF1 modulation of light signaling pathways under specific environmental conditions, and 3) determine the role of MMF1 in regulating gene expression networks downstream of light signaling pathways. The knowledge gained from this work will provide valuable insight into understanding the mechanisms that couple light signaling, the circadian clock and growth under multiple conditions. This information will contribute to the ability to better anticipate plant responses to the environment and identify genetic targets to manipulate for increased agricultural productivity. The proposed research will provide scientific training and educational opportunities for students at the secondary school, undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels through the PI's participation in on-going science outreach and REU programs at the Danforth Plant Science Center and an appointment at Washington University in St. Louis. Also, an inexpensive time-lapse imaging system will be combined with educational materials for distribution to local high schools to cultivate an interest in plant responses to the environment. Through assembling, programming, and incorporating these low-cost, open-source plant-imaging systems into science projects within the classroom, local students will gain a unique opportunity to participate in STEM activities. Moreover, working with the public has the potential to develop innovative and distributive sensor systems for the non-invasive monitoring of plant growth. Together, the proposed research will have a significant impact on society through a better understanding of circadian clock function in diverse species and increased engagement with the public through participation in education and training programs."
0.070001,"Information technology has been an engine for economic growth largely due to the trend known as Moore's law, whereby the component density and computational power of computer chips doubles approximately every two years. In the not too distant future the building blocks of these circuits is set to reach atomic scale, where the laws of quantum physics will replace the familiar laws of classical physics that govern our everyday world. Surprisingly, theoretical studies have shown that if we can manipulate and control quantum devices as well as we now manipulate and control classical devices, entirely new avenues will open up to process information according to quantum mechanics. As a result, quantum computers will in principle be able to solve some important computational problems exponentially faster than classical computers. It is also thought that a simpler class of devices, commonly referred to as analog quantum simulators, may provide approximate solutions to important problems in chemistry and materials science that are currently intractable. Though a functional quantum computer remains a distant goal, the transformative ideas of quantum computation and simulation hold promise to radically expand the capabilities of computer and information technology and sustain its future growth.<br/><br/>This award builds on previous accomplishments by the Principal Investigators in the science and engineering field known as quantum control, which studies how physical devices governed by quantum mechanics can be manipulated and controlled with high precision, even in the presence of inevitable device imperfections and outside disturbances. The first objective of this award is to develop new techniques whereby one can evaluate and verify the operation of quantum devices. This will be done through the use of protocols known as quantum tomography, which determine the state and behavior of a quantum device through a series of carefully chosen measurements. The challenge will be to make these protocols more efficient, i. e., minimizing the number of measurements required, and also more robust, e. g., reliable in the presence of imperfections. The second objective of this award is to realize an analog quantum simulator based on a single atom. This single-atom device will be used to simulate a model system whose behavior is known to be chaotic, i. e., hypersensitive to imperfections and outside disturbances. By quantifying the accuracy of the simulator in the presence of known imperfections, this research will address essential but so far unanswered questions: How far can one trust the predictions of an analog quantum simulator in this challenging but common scenario? And can its accuracy and reliability be improved through state-of-the-art techniques for quantum control? The answer to these questions is relevant for large, federally funded research programs in analog quantum simulation at top research institutions across the US.<br/><br/>State-of-the-art quantum control is approaching the thresholds for fault-tolerant operation on a few physical platforms and is steadily improving on many others. As a result, researchers are now pursuing architectures for rudimentary digital quantum computation and analog quantum simulation (AQS). To continue on this path towards useful quantum information processing (QIP), there is an urgent need for more sophisticated tools in the areas of quantum control and quantum tomography, and especially for protocols that are resistant to real-world errors and imperfections. Furthermore, the quantum information community is heavily invested in AQS under the assumption that errors are less critical than in a digital quantum computer. This makes it imperative to study the tolerance of AQS to errors, even in the absence of decoherence, and the prospects of robust control in the context of complex dynamics such as quantum chaos.<br/><br/>This award will focus on quantum control and measurement, and their application in quantum tomography and analog quantum simulation. The work will build on well established ideas from optimal control and measurement theory, bringing these to bear on a unique experimental testbed: electron-nuclear spins of cold 133Cs atoms in their electronic ground state. This system provides long coherence times, can be manipulated with radio-frequency, microwave, and optical fields, is accessible to measurement though Stern-Gerlach analysis, and has a 16-dimensional Hilbert space, large enough to explore non-trivial tasks of QIP. With its proven capability to apply high-fidelity unitary maps and perform high-fidelity orthogonal measurements, the testbed provides the building blocks needed for QIP at levels of increasing complexity. The planned research is a mixture of theory and experiment, and will address topics in quantum measurement and tomography. In addition, analog quantum simulation, studying the quantum simulation of a spin-15/2 Quantum Kicked Top (QKT) and the use of the QKT paradigm to explore robust quantum simulation in the presence of chaos will be explored. Because the methodologies of robust control and tomography are independent of any particular platform, results from this award will serve as a benchmark for what can be achieved, and a template for similar advances elsewhere in laboratories working with different physical systems. This will help facilitate progress in the broader field of QIP."
1.653308,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Photosynthesis provides food, fuel, and fiber to humans and other animals. The growing human population and the increasing worldwide demand for high protein diets and biofuels generate needs for higher plant productivity and improved nutritional quality in crop plants. To improve crop yield and nutritional value, it is important to have a better understanding of how plants utilize carbon from the air and nitrogen from the soil to produce biomass. In green tissues of plants, photosynthesis and the biosynthesis of many amino acids both occur in chloroplasts. These processes are linked to each other, as photosynthesis provides both the carbon and energy for amino acid biosynthesis, while amino acids are the building blocks for the protein components of photosynthesis. Despite an awareness of this relationship, large gaps exist in our understanding of how these important biological processes interact. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the connections between photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. Computational integration of Arabidopsis thaliana phenotype data (photosynthetic parameters, amino acid and fatty acid profiles, seed carbon and nitrogen content) of mutants with defects in chloroplast-targeted nuclear-encoded gene products will be used to generate a list of candidate genes that can guide us to those connections. The candidate genes will be experimentally tested for changes in photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism, and those mutants with robust and interesting phenotypes will then undergo more focused studies. By increasing our understanding of the complex interactions between photosynthesis and amino acid metabolism, we will be in a position to effectuate advantageous changes in both.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project will increase our understanding of the interactions between photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism, and these results should inform plant breeding and biotechnological approaches to crop improvement. The data and outcomes of the project will be made publicly available via publications and a project website. In addition to providing year-round training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, the project will integrate research and education as part of established summer Research Experiences for Undergraduate Programs at Western Michigan University (WMU) and Michigan State University (MSU). The collaboration between WMU and MSU with respect to the research, education, and outreach activities will also provide cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional training and experience to trainees in both laboratories."
0.911361,"Intellectual Merit<br/>Biological nitrogen fixation - the reduction of N2 to yield two moles of ammonia (NH3/ NH4+) that are available as plant nutrient - is catalyzed by the metalloenzyme, nitrogenase. The agronomic, economic, and social significance of nitrogenase can be appreciated by recognizing that the lives of about two-thirds of today's human population depend on plant growth, which relies on biologically fixed nitrogen generated by nitrogenase. The other third depends on nitrogen fixation by the industrial Haber-Bosch process, but this process is a significant component in the world's energy usage, demanding approximately 1 percent of human energy consumption. Whether the biological process can be more effectively exploited for human benefit remains an urgent question, and thus it is imperative that an understanding be achieved of the means by which organisms manage to activate and cleave N2 at ambient temperature and pressure. This project is addressing these questions through the use of electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies to characterize catalytic intermediates that form during the process of nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. ENDOR/ESEEM studies uniquely provide information about the electronic properties of the substrate-binding/reduction active site, and supply detailed structural information regarding metal-bound substrates, intermediates, and products. No other technique offers this information. <br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The outreach program associated with this project can be viewed (roughly) as a pyramid. At the apex are intellectual/scientific contributions to the discipline itself, and to the research community. Supporting these intellectual endeavors are contributions to the training of post doctoral scholars and graduate students, not only for this project but throughout the country and the world. The foundation level involves the encouragement of undergraduates and even high-school students, especially of women and underrepresented minorities, to participate in the scientific enterprise."
0.17799,"This research project investigates how new biological species form. Laboratory-based efforts to identify genetic and molecular mechanisms of speciation in nematode worms will be aided by the isolation of new worm strains and species by members of the general public. High school students will participate directly in scientific research by collecting nematodes from rotting fruits and flowers. They will learn how research is performed and will also gain a basic understanding of genes, DNA, and evolution that is becoming increasingly more important and societally relevant. By engaging students in the practice of science, this project fulfills one of the three central dimensions in the Next Generation Science Standards recently adopted by many states across the nation and will improve scientific literacy in the general population by helping to build an informed public that understands the scientific enterprise and can better contribute to future national policy decisions that require the interpretation and evaluation of scientific data.<br/><br/>The process of speciation involves the evolution of reproductive barriers between populations within a species so that a single species can split. Though multiple reproductive barriers typically isolate existing species, less is known about which barriers drove the speciation process originally. The goal of the project is to identify genes that cause reproductive isolation and determine their molecular mechanisms of action. The project is focused on identifying genes that mediate incompatibility within species and will operate at three levels to: 1) determine the detailed molecular and cellular mechanism of action of a previously identified intraspecific incompatibility in the nematode C. elegans mediated by a selfish toxin/antidote gene pair, 2) identify the genes involved in a newly discovered nuclear-cytoplasmic intraspecific incompatibility in the related nematode species C. nouraguensis, and 3) systematically search for more intraspecific genetic incompatibilities within the Caenorhabditis genus in a large-scale project to isolate new strains of Caenorhabditis species using a crowdsourcing approach implemented in high school classrooms, and by systematic crosses of strains performed by undergraduate researchers to test for hybrid breakdown."
0.469969,"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Organic semiconductors have many applications in portable, large-area or ubiquitous electronics. They also have great potential in bioelectronics as active materials in sensors or transducers. All such devices work by transporting charges; finding materials with large charge mobilities is therefore a major goal in the field of organic electronics. The search for high-mobility organic semiconductors, however, is still largely conducted with an Edisonian philosophy. The primary goal of the proposed activity is the development of a set of rational design principles for creating high-mobility conjugated homopolymers and copolymers which will impact all applications of organic semiconductors, from solar cells to light-emitting diodes and transistors. Insight derived from theory will be used to design and synthesize molecules that will be analyzed experimentally using X-ray diffraction for structural characterization and optical spectroscopy for measuring charge delocalization. These attributes will be correlated with the ability of the materials to carry current. The ultimate goal is to link specific features of the molecular structure and of the short-range arrangement of molecules within the assembly to carrier mobility. The methods developed, both theoretical and experimental, can potentially streamline the search for high mobility polymers and pave the way for the next generation of high-performance organic-based electronic devices. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Rational design of functional materials will be based on a theoretical model that accounts for charge transport, nuclear-electronic coupling, and various manifestations of diagonal and off-diagonal disorder within a two-dimensional lattice appropriate for mixed or segregated pi-stacks. Design principles derived from theory will be tested on several model Donor-Acceptor copolymers in which intrachain torsional disorder and/or HOMO energy alternation is carefully controlled. Structure/property relationships will be evaluated on high-performance copolymers based on the indacenodithiophene structural motif using acceptors with varying electron-withdrawing strengths. Microstructural characterization of thin polymer films will be accomplished using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD), and charge delocalization will be probed using charge modulation spectroscopy (CMS) on oriented samples in order to obtain polarization resolution. The proposed activity will provide the organic electronics community with a method to experimentally and theoretically evaluate materials quickly for the design of high-performance organic semiconductors. It will also provide the first measurements of the coherence length of polarons in conjugated polymers using steady-state infra-red absorption spectroscopy. The coherence length will be linked to the design of new conjugated polymers and their short-range morphologies, thereby providing fundamental insights into what governs delocalization and trapping in conjugated polymer films."
0.745468,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize radiation-tolerant integrated circuit (IC) technology for producing radiation-tolerant/hardened (rad-hard) ICs capable of being manufactured using leading-edge commercial IC processing instead of expensive specialized processes which use older, less efficient lithography nodes. The direct customers for the technology, to be delivered in the form of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and support services, will be semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor foundries. In the CT scanner industry, improved radiation-tolerance of the electronics will allow key components to be placed directly in the X-ray path, improving signal quality, and resulting in better images at reduced X-ray dose levels to patients. Reducing X-ray exposure from CT scans is a medical priority, as it has been estimated that 0.4% of current cancer incidents result from high X-ray doses from CT scans. Application of the patent-pending technology in radiation-hard ICs for a wide range of other commercial radiation-environment markets will follow, including commercial satellites, nuclear-power electronics, nondestructive testing, and medical electronics sterilization. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide integrated circuit (IC) designers access to leading-edge IC technology and advanced lithography nodes in developing ICs for radiation-tolerant applications, and is based on patent-pending transistor-level design and layout innovations and their implementation in EDA tools. In Phase I, proof-of-concept was established; transistor structures evaluated for X-ray and gamma radiation tolerance improved by a factor of 7 for 1.8V transistors, and by well over a factor of 10 for 5V transistors, with the use of the technology. The research objective of Phase II is to provide ready access to the benefits of the technology to IC designers by incorporating the methodologies for transistor-level design and layout improvements into industry-standard EDA tools. A number of technical challenges will be addressed in Phase II, including optimizing the tools for producing area-efficient and cost-efficient transistor layouts, and assuring seamless integration with existing design flows.

The team of researchers exploits the unique properties of carbon nanotubes to manipulate and interrogate the qubits, with the goal of demonstrating coherent control of the fragile quantum states. The key properties of nanotubes that make them well suited for quantum information processing are themselves newly understood, and are a forefront area of fundamental physics. Those properties include spin-orbit coupling associated with circumferential motion around the nanotube, electron-nuclear coupling and the ability to control dephasing of electron spin.

0.250001,"Ignacio Franco of the University of Rochester is supported by a CAREER award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to investigate the fundamental limits in the laser control of electrons and electronic properties in matter by exploiting quantum mechanical effects, an area of research known as quantum control. The focus is on lasers rather than more conventional means (e.g., an applied voltage, or changes in thermodynamic control variables) because lasers offer the possibility of change on an ultrafast timescale (on the order of a millionth of one billionth of a second). The Franco group investigates, for instance, the microscopic origin of the fastest existing method for the generation of currents, and the ability of lasers to turn insulating materials into transient metals. In addition to interest at a fundamental level, pushing the time limit in which electronic properties can be controlled has the potential to catalyze transformative progress in chemistry, spectroscopy, optoelectronic device design, communication through electrical signals, and any other science or technology based on electronic properties and their control. Professor Franco is impacting graduate education by redesigning the teaching of graduate level Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry through active learning pedagogies. With this project, he contributes to the development of a diverse, globally-engaged, U.S. science and engineering workforce by creating summer research opportunities for top international undergraduate students in Chemistry at the University of Rochester.<br/><br/>Specifically, the Franco group advances the capabilities of using high and intermediate intensity ultrafast laser pulses to manipulate electronic properties and dynamics in nanoscale matter. The vision of the group is to establish structure-function relations that apply to matter driven far from equilibrium by laser fields, and to push the limit in which control of electrons is exerted. A fundamental limit that has historically hindered progress in the quantum control of electrons is the deleterious effects on the control introduced by ultrafast electronic decoherence processes arising from electron-nuclear interactions. To overcome this limit, Professor Franco and his research group: (i) Identify, model, and quantify basic mechanisms for electronic coherence loss, as a necessary step in the design of laser control scenarios that either avoid or take advantage of the decoherence. (ii) Develop novel routes for laser control of electrons based on the Dynamic Stark Effect induced by non-resonant laser fields of intermediate intensity (non-perturbative but non-ionizing) that are robust to decoherence. Together, these developments catalyze the design of novel control experiments, ultrafast opto-electronic technologies, and a new class of dynamic electronic materials with effective laser-induced properties tunable on a femtosecond timescale. This project incorporates an integrated research and educational plan that provides students with a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary training and collaborative work at the interface between Chemistry, Physics, Nanoscience and Optics. The work impacts graduate education, through a proposed redesign of the teaching of graduate level Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry by incorporating active learning pedagogies, such as flipped classrooms and peer learning problem solving sessions."

The compounds serve to accelerate the rate at which water is decomposed to hydrogen and oxygen, releasing the energy that once held the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together in each water molecule. The compounds being developed in this project are expected to have greater stability than existing materials in use, thus extending the practicality of this promising new source of alternative energy. The project is strengthening several existing academic/government/industrial collaborations between UNT and other US universities, national laboratories, and private sector entities as well as some existing and new international collaborations. The research is having a broader impact on energy-related science through the development of promising new technologies.<br/><br/>In this project, a series of phosphorescent complexes with various molecular- and nano-structural complexity are being investigated for their potential use as photocatalysts for water splitting. New photocatalyst candidates based on metal-organic compositions are being developed to engender greater material stability under practical environments in the presence of water and sunlight. The project focuses on a new design of practical multi-electron photocatalyst candidates that can operate in an aqueous instead of organic or mixed organic/aqueous media. The intent is to target water splitting in an efficient, environmentally-responsible manner using catalysts that operate homogeneously, or heterogeneously via solid films in order to increase ruggedness, concentrate the active material, and utilize intermolecular interactions to potentially sensitize cooperative electron transfer. Water solubility, while maintaining high luminescence quantum yield and long phosphorescence lifetime, is a highly desirable attribute for outer-sphere multi-electron photocatalysis. These conditions are satisfied by multiple embodiments of the macromolecular, supramolecular, and nanomolecular complexes that the Omary group is developing in this project in an effort to improve the state of the art of current water splitting photosensitizers. For inner-sphere processes, mono- and multi-nuclear complexes are designed to act as energy reservoirs for 6-12 photoelectrons in some solution compositions, whereas some solid photocatalysts have the potential to provide an almost infinite reservoir of electrons.

Quantum field theory is a unifying mathematical language for such systems. Appropriately, this language is difficult, and in general its ""grammatical rules"" are not even yet established. In this situation, any instances, or ""models"", of quantum field theory whose equations can be worked out all the way through are especially valuable. Such models are known as ""integrable quantum field theories"". Mainly, they serve as the testing ground for verification and development of ideas and mathematical methods, but remarkably many integrable ""models"" directly apply to theoretical understanding of properties of complex materials. That is why today the integrable quantum field theories constitute one of the most important and actively developed area of mathematical physics. Moreover, since the discovery of ""gauge/string duality"" and the role of integrability in this relation, this field of research has found itself at the cutting edge of theoretical high-energy physics. Unfortunately, the integrable models emerging in this context still resist full solution. This research project proposes further development of integrable quantum field theories, with emphasis on the so-called integrable sigma models. This is exactly the general class of models which emerge in the context of the gauge/string duality. Also, similar models are believed to provide theoretical understanding of particularly complicated disordered systems in physics of materials. It is proposed to develop a certain new class of integrable sigma-models, with novel mathematical structure, and find full solutions. This is an intermediate step in the approach to the systems of direct application in the gauge/string dualities. Interestingly, mathematical methods developed for integrable quantum field theories turn out to have broader significance in mathematical physics, and often help to investigate a wider class of non-integrable systems. This area will be explored as well.<br/><br/>The activity consists of three projects. (1) Analysis of a new class of integrable sigma models whose target spaces are deformed group manifolds. With the most general known deformations, quantum integrability of such models require significant modifications of standard tools such as the Lax representations, the Yang-Baxter algebras, and Baxter's Q operators and their relations. The project's goal is to develop all such modifications, and use that as the basis for finding full solutions. The key to our approach will be the so-called ODE/IQFT correspondence, the new mathematical tool of integrable quantum field theories (""IQFT side"") which allows to ""encode"" its algebraic structures into a system of ordinary differential equations (""ODE"" side). This project lays in the mainstream of the current research in mathematical physics; its significance is in the relation to the gauge/string dualities, and possibly to physics of disordered systems. The other two parts the research is to explore applications of the methods of integrability in non-integrable systems. (2) The relation between the 't Hooft's equation in 1+1 QCD and the Baxter's T-Q equation will be used to analyze the meson decays and scattering amplitudes in the large-N expansion, with the ultimate goal of gaining universal tools for analysis of decays and amplitudes in generic 1+1 systems with confining interactions, which are very common in condensed matter physics. (3) The third part addresses possibility of emergence of near-integrable subsystems in otherwise non-integrable quantum field theories, the possibility which was not previously explored."
0.199719,"The project by Metropolitan State University of Denver and its sister institutions Community College of Denver and University of Colorado-Denver, is integrating a 300 MHz FT-NMR (Fourier Transform-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectrometer into the organic laboratory. The incorporation of modern spectroscopic techniques is enhancing the skill set students need for success in STEM careers. The high resolution, sophisticated pulse sequences, and dramatically improved throughput of the FT-NMR is allowing a shift to inquiry- and discovery-based teaching laboratory experiences which in turn, is driving improvements in students' ability to reach valid conclusions from data, in their scientific literacy, and in their technical writing. The project builds on preliminary data which demonstrates that students learn more and are more prepared for STEM careers and graduate study, when exposed to authentic research as opposed to traditional recipe/verification laboratory curriculum. In addition to the incorporation of effective, evidenced-based teaching practices in the organic laboratories of the three institutions, the students will produce a dynamic, web-based lab manual wherein they are the primary contributors, the development of which enhances student literacy skills, research ethics, laboratory stewardship, and experimental design. The project will lead to broadening participation in the sciences since the three institutions serve a large number of Colorado's underrepresented-in-STEM student population as well as numerous students who transfer from community colleges."

0.66,"In this Career award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Division of Chemistry and the EPSCoR office, Professor Miao from the University of Southern Mississippi and his students will conduct research on biosensors based on electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL). The focus will be on simultaneous multiplexing ECL detection and quantification of biomolecules in a sample matrix with nanomaterials. The proposed detection scheme may allow for simultaneous measurements of 3-5 analytes without the need for target amplification or the use of enzymes. By using different types of ECL labels (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and quantum dots), ECL detection can be performed in either organic or aqueous solutions, or in a solid-state format. Tools such as cyclic voltammetry, ECL coupled with scanning electrochemical microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrochemical and ECL digital simulations will be used to achieve these objectives. Furthermore, investigation and preparation of nano-thickness Au film or Au nanoparticles (NPs) coatings for transparent electrodes for high performance ECL detection will be carried out. Finally, investigations of the photochemical, electrochemical, and ECL behavior as well as an exploration of sensing applications of templated micro- to nano-scale semiconductive metal chalcogenide films and NPs will be conducted.<br/><br/>ECL biosensors may find applications in clinical diagnostics, forensic chemistry, environmental investigations, pharmaceutical studies, and even in sensitive detection of high explosives and biological warfare agents - which is a pertinent issue in global security.<br/><br/>Professor Miao's research will be integrated with undergraduate and graduate education. In this context, an analytical ECL lab that is inexpensive, easy to operate, and adaptable to various levels of teaching and learning environments will be developed with an electrochemical instrument manufacture. In addition, in collaboration with colleagues from USM, Professor Miao will integrate instrumental analysis and inorganic as well as physical chemistry experiments into one senior undergraduate chemistry lab. The implementation of an integrative lab will serve as a model for other chemistry departments in the region and provide the opportunity to forge more robust relationships between USM and regional community colleges."

0.24,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Organic molecules and polymers continue to receive attention as semiconducting materials in a wide array of practical applications, including paper electronics, solid-state lighting, solar cells and scaffolds for tissue growth. Most devices benefit from rapid energy transport, which is dictated by how fast an electronic excitation on one molecule can be transferred to a more distant molecule. However, despite the more than five decades of intensive experimental and theoretical research, there are still many questions regarding the nature of the electronic excitations in organic molecular aggregates, thin films and crystals. The main objective of the proposed research is to develop a theory of electronic coupling between molecules which takes into account the organization of molecules relative to each other. This theory will provide information about the rate of energy transfer and will reveal important information about the properties of the electronic excitations, information that can be used to design more efficient devices. The PI's group will also explore the use of optical microcavities for controlling material properties. Microcavities consist of two mirrors separated by a very short distance of the order of one millionth of a meter. The interaction between light and matter is greatly amplified for materials inserted between such mirrors. The proposed research will benefit from collaborations with the experimental groups at the University of Massachusetts and the University of Montreal.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research will be in an enhanced understanding of the photophysical and transport properties of a technologically important class of materials. The commercial impact of organic electronic devices is expected to dramatically increase over the next decade through products like flexible displays, electronic labels, solid-state lighting and solar cells. The wide array of photophysical and transport behaviors afforded by molecular aggregates studied in this proposal could provide the basis for novel design paradigms for efficient solar absorbers and light emitting materials.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The main goal of the proposed research is to develop a theory for the photophysical response of molecular aggregates which accounts for the simultaneous presence of long-range Coulombic interactions and short-range charge-transfer (CT) interactions between the constituent molecules. The theory will consider the electronic coupling, the electronic-nuclear coupling, and diagonal and off-diagonal disorder on equal footing and will extend the conventional J- and H-aggregate model of Kasha to systems such as molecular pi-stacks, in which the very close proximity between neighboring molecules allows for significant overlap between molecular orbitals. Investigations are planned to understand the photophysical and transport properties of different aggregate types and how such aggregates evolve into conventional H- and J-aggregates as the adiabatic CT exciton is tuned away from the parent Frenkel exciton. Studies will also be undertaken to determine how aggregate properties are altered by immersion into a tuned optical microcavity. The analyses will be based on Holstein-like Hamiltonians represented in a one- and two-particle basis set. Fundamental excitations and their spectral signatures will be evaluated using numerical matrix techniques. Specific applications will be made to rylene pi-stacks which have been studied as dye pigments and electron-transporting materials, as well as poly(3-hexylthiophene) pi-stacks which make excellent exciton transporting materials in photovoltaic devices. The proposed research will benefit from collaborations with the experimental groups at the University of Massachusetts and the University of Montreal. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research will be in an enhanced understanding of the photophysical and transport properties of a technologically important class of materials.

The first phases of observations will be conducted in the near-infrared, with later follow-up observations on the new Atacama Large Millimetre-submillimetre Array (ALMA).<br/><br/>The study of dying stars has many implications for stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, and nucleosynthesis.

The laboratory at Cal State Fullerton will investigate details of the scattering process involving excitation of strong transitions in these targets specifically to look at how spin and orbital angular momentum is imparted by the incident directed electrons onto the target atoms/molecules. The targets chosen are the rare gases (neon, argon, krypton and xenon) and the molecules are hydrogen and nitrogen which have different electron-nuclear couplings. The research also aims to look at the ionization of the atomic targets. The thrust of this is to investigate the basic collision quantum physics that describes such processes. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this work is its involvement in state of the art research of many US undergraduate students at Cal State Fullerton in the laboratory. They then have a significantly increased chance to go onto PhD programs (mostly nationally, but in one case internationally). The research training also provided skills needed for working in industry or in other laboratories. These students get to do frontline research and benefit from collaborating with each other and faculty. It also provides collaborative research between Cal State Fullerton and several other theoretical and experimental collision physics programs, both nationally and internationally. The success of this group with data that tests collision models such as (most recently) the R-matrix B-spline was especially highlighted in the keynote talk at the last American Physical Society- Gaseous Electronics Conference at Salt Lake City. Such type of data is useful for industrial, plasma and astrophysical applications."
0.36299,"Autotroph-herbivore interactions in marine food webs are important to fisheries, the global carbon cycle, and, because of harmful algal blooms, human health. The recent hypothesis that harmful algae interfere with the growth and reproduction of zooplankton because of specific structural modifications of the algal sterols will be tested in research on the roles of nutritional factors in planktonic food webs. The effects of marine algal sterols on herbivorous crustaceans will be investigated in three calanoid copepods, Acartia hudsonica, Eurytemora affinis, and Calanus finmarchicus, and brine shrimp, Artemia salina. In this project, studies will be carried out to determine whether marine algal sterols can be metabolized to cholesterol by zooplankton and the relative efficiency of this process. This information is critical for assessing the nutritional value of different algal diets. Using the metabolic studies as a foundation, further experiments will seek to determine whether selected sterols, some of which have structural similarities to steroid hormones, have an inhibitory impact on the growth and reproduction of crustaceans. The analytical techniques used in these experiments will be high-field 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) and gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). Test sterols for these experiments will be labeled with stable isotopes (13C and 2H) in specific positions by chemical synthesis.<br/><br/>An important aspect of this project is the education and development of scientists.

0.441498,"Intellectual Merit: Photosynthesis, which harvests solar energy and assimilates atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), represents the ""engine"" of life. Constraints on photosynthesis and plant growth can occur in most land plants where access to CO2 becomes limiting under environmental stress (drought, high temperature, saline soils). Some plants evolved a metabolic pump (called C4) which actively accumulates CO2, conferring an advantage, especially under extreme environments. Prior to the 2001 discovery of species which perform C4 in individual photosynthetic cells, the paradigm for C4 plants was a requirement for cooperative function of two cell types. In contrast, the single-cell C4 species, which have a unique form of carbon acquisition, contain photosynthetic cells with two types of chloroplasts in separate compartments, one supporting the capture of atmospheric CO2, the other functioning in its assimilation into organic matter. Problems to be investigated in this project are identification and characterization of genes and proteins required for the development and function of single-cell C4 photosynthesis. This involves identification of differences in protein composition of the two types of chloroplasts, the nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes responsible for their synthesis, and the genetic control of chloroplast differentiation. The approach will include use of molecular and microscopic techniques to analyze and identify the products of gene expression leading to development of this form of C4. This project is expected to gain insights into an exceptional mechanism of photosynthesis, and into regulation of biochemical differentiation in cell biology. The research project will also involve an international collaboration with Dr. S. Offermann of Hannover University in Germany, which is sponsored by the International Office of Science and Engineering. This collaboration will provide an international learning experience for the graduate students and will extend the expertise of the US lab. <br/>Broader Impacts: The research is expected to contribute new insights that will impact education, future research on photosynthesis, and mechanisms of adaptations in plants. There are potential applications for solving growing global limitations on bio-resources. The single-cell mechanism is an attractive model for developing crops, e.g. rice, with improved productivity, especially under environmental stress."
0.366207,"Evidence is mounting that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a sub-nuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a cosmic gravitational-wave background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale of Inflation.

Many slow-roll models of Inflation produce r ~ 0.01?0.1, corresponding to peak CMB fluctuations of 30?100 nK rms on degree angular scales. Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey described the search for the CGB as ""the most exciting quest of all"", and emphasized that ""mid-term investment is needed for systems aimed at detecting the (B-mode) polarization of the CMB"".

BICEP3 observations, when combined with SPUD's deep 150 GHz and 220 GHz coverage, will provide significantly more powerful discrimination between CMB polarization and Galactic foregrounds. Detection of the CGB would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB was to the Big Bang. Indeed its impact might be even broader, as Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard.

Yet these individual locations have had notoriously low spatial resolution, which limits their potential to address fundamental questions concerning the structure and composition of the Earth?s interior, the nature of earthquakes, and the seismic hazards they impose on our society and the built environment. The main goal of this project is to significantly improve the location precision of millions of earthquakes on a global scale by applying higher-order earthquake location methods that take advantage of the increasing quantity and quality of seismic archives and the availability of affordable computing power. This project will focus on using the wealth of high-precision data to better understand, in a comparative way, the seismogenic structure and processes that control subduction zones worldwide. Results from this project are expected to find many applications in the Earth Sciences, and to have social impact in the areas of natural hazards and seismic verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).<br/><br/>The tremendous growth in global seismic archives over the last several decades, the continuous fall in computing costs, and advances in earthquake relocation methods provide a unique opportunity to substantially improve the spatial resolution of standard global earthquake catalogs. The locations of hypocenters in these catalogs, typically estimated one event at a time from phase arrival times observed at global seismic stations, have notoriously low accuracy that hamper studies in a wide range of research areas, not only in Seismology, but in the Geosciences in general. This continuing project builds on previous work that developed high-efficiency waveform cross-correlation and double-difference (DD) algorithms to relocate more than 3 million earthquakes listed in the combined bulletins of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) and NEIC?s Earthquake Data Report, spanning the years 1964-2012. These tools increase the precision of the earthquake locations by harnessing new procedures that can cope with the computational load of this massive-scale undertaking. Cross-correlation based phase delay times are measured on billions of pairs of waveforms, and efficient teleseismic double-difference algorithms invert these data in combination with reported phase arrival times. Initial results using this approach already reveal characteristic seismicity patterns in time and space, and provide new data that help gain insight into seismogenic processes at unprecedented resolution. This project will focus on the fine-scale structure of Wadati-Benioff zone seismicity at subduction zones and the nature of narrow double-seismic zones, and analyze the relocated seismicity associated with recent great subduction earthquakes to better understand their structural and kinematic behavior. A global DD catalog will likely find many applications in the Earth Sciences, and may help improve our understanding of the physical processes controlling earthquakes, our ability to image the structure and composition of the Earth?s interior, and our capability to estimate the hazards imposed by large earthquakes."
0.375,"In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Zhiping Zheng of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Arizona will systematically explore the synthesis of structurally interesting and practically significant lanthanide cluster complexes. Studies will be carried out using amino acids and amino acid-like ligands, functionalized carboxylates, and beta-diketonates to control the hydrolysis of the lanthanide ions and the assembly of high-nuclearity clusters. The templating effects of anions in the assembly of such species will be investigated. Functionalized beta-diketonates will be used for the making of cluster complexes that are potentially useful in biomedical imaging, luminescent liquid-crystal displays, magneto-optical data storage, and magnetic refrigeration technology. <br/><br/>This work will lead to much needed synthetic approaches to fundamentally interesting but otherwise synthetically elusive lanthanide compounds. Discovery of lanthanide-containing materials with significant technological applications is anticipated. The research will provide ample opportunities for the education and training of students, from pre-undergraduate to graduate, including those from groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences."
0.554365,"Understanding the mechanisms by which new species arise is a fundamental goal of biology. Diverging populations accumulate genetic differences that may cause conflicts (reduced fitness) when populations come back together and hybridize. This leads to further isolation of the populations, and, eventually, to speciation. Speciation work in model systems has concentrated on conflicts involving the gender-determining chromosomes, but a great number of organisms across the tree of life lack these chromosomes. This project uses a copepod, a small marine invertebrate, to understand how genetic conflicts underlying speciation evolve in organisms without gender-determing chromosomes. By hybridizing pairs of populations from a known evolutionary tree, the study will assess how different types of conflicts (nuclear-nuclear vs. nuclear-mitochondrial) accumulate over time and whether the same chromosomal regions evolve conflicts in evolutionarily independent lineages. It will assess the repeatability of evolutionary trajectories by tracking genetic changes in large, lab-based hybrid populations and will identify potential candidate genes involved in conflicts.<br/><br/>This project relates to issues of biodiversity and conservation by exploring how the lack of sex chromosomes impacts species diversification and consequences of hybridization. Its focus on the evolution of nuclear-mitochondrial conflicts, an important cause of disease, gives this study potential biomedical applications. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher, Ph.D. students, and numerous undergraduate researchers. It will also include outreach to diverse communities in and around Los Angeles, including a collaboration with the Aquarium of the Pacific aimed at promoting awareness of the evolutionary processes currently at work in the ocean and their importance."
0.837019,"Title: Biophysical Studies of Metalloenzymes<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences Systems Program and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Bioavailable nitrogen derived from ammonia produced by the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen is second only to water as the limiting nutrient in plant growth. From the appearance of the enzyme nitrogenase approximately two billion years ago, until the wide-spread use of the Haber-Bosch process in the 1950's for the chemical production of ammonia fertilizers, all life obtained nitrogen from biological nitrogen fixation using the nitrogenase enzyme. Currently, biological nitrogen fixation using nitrogenase supplies approximately one-half of the world's ammonia. The remaining half is produced by the Haber-Bosch industrial process, a process that is responsible for approximately 2% of the world's total energy consumption. The goal of this research is to reveal the mechanism of nitrogenase function. Understanding of nitrogenase function will potentially enable the effective utilization of nitrogenase activity for greater human benefit, increasing food production and reducing energy consumption during the industrial production of ammonia fertilizers. In addition, investigators are active in science education and training at all levels.<br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to further refine the nitrogenase reaction mechanism elucidated by the investigators through the use of genetic/biochemical approaches for the isolation of catalytic intermediates in combination with the laboratory's use of electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopies to characterize the reaction intermediates. A second goal of the project is to determine the structure and electronic properties of enzymatic intermediates throughout the catalytic cycle, by integrating hydrogen, deuterium, (14,15)nitrogen, (57)Fe and (95)Mo ENDOR/ESEEM spectroscopic studies with quantum chemical calculations that for the first time introduce QM/MM methods to the study of nitrogenase intermediates. The third goal of the project is to study the biomimetic molybdenum and iron complexes in order to advance the understanding of the biocatalytic potential of these complexes. EPR/ENDOR characterizations of biomimetic Mo and Fe complexes yield powerful constraints on the identification of substrate-derived moieties in our nitrogenase intermediates. In addition, these complexes have their own, fundamental importance to coordination chemistry that include non-classical M-H(2) adducts that show novel H(2) rotational dynamics and also are relevant for hydrogen catalysis and energy storage."
