0.309016,"Smooth invertible transformations, or deformations, are fast becoming important tools in modern data analysis. The nonlinear nature of deformations makes these objects extremely powerful while at the same time making them challenging to estimate and theoretically explore. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The theoretical properties of estimated deformations for generating nonparametric and semiparametric statistical estimates are analyzed through a surprising connection with Stein's method. In addition, the investigator focuses on recent results found in the theory of optimal transport, which has the potential to provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for deformable templates. The computational aspects of estimated deformations will utilize a new Euler-Lagrange characterization of a penalized maximum likelihood estimate, which can significantly relieve the typical computational burden associated with estimation. One consequence will be to make these methods available for widespread use by statistical practitioners in a broad range of problems: nonparametric and semiparametric density estimation, estimating gravitational lensing in cosmology and posterior sampling techniques, to name a few. Another intellectual merit of this proposal are the scientific ramifications of two new proposed deformation estimates of weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): a wavelet/Slepian quadratic estimator and a new Bayesian lensing estimator. Gravitational lensing studies have become one of the most successful tools for probing the nature of dark matter. The precise estimation of lensing is important for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, understanding cosmic structure, constraining cosmological parameters and detecting gravity waves. The investigator proposes to uses wavelets and Slepian multi-tapers to adapt the quadratic estimate to local foreground contaminants and sky cuts, which are ubiquitous features in most modern cosmological surveys. The investigator proposes a new Bayesian estimator which has the potential to dramatically change the way gravitational lensing studies are done and how they are integrated within other astronomical surveys.<br/><br/>Smooth invertible transformations, or deformations, are fast becoming important tools in modern data analysis. They have been used with spectacular success in the field of computational anatomy where time varying vector field flows which generate deformations are used to statistically analyze medical fMRI images and quantify abnormal morphological structure. In cosmology, deformations are used to model gravitational distortions of the cosmic microwave background from dark matter density fluctuations, and have resulted in a deeper understanding of cosmic structure. Even though these important tools are becoming integrated in modern scientific methods, the statistical properties of estimated deformations have been largely unexplored. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The tools resulting from this project will be useful, not only in statistics, but also in other branches of science and technology ranging from genetics to machine learning. In the field of physics, for example, the potential scientific progress resulting from gravitational lensing estimation could a have broad impact on scientific understanding and the future of scientific research. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly important to train graduate and undergraduate students with the tools necessary to successfully navigate interdisciplinary work, and who are prepared for independent research. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal will foster a culture of collaboration that will reach the fundamentals of statistical education and will deepen ties with statistics and other physical sciences. In addition, through the integration of research and education, the proposal will teach both graduate and undergraduate students research skills. The result will be two fold. First, it will train graduate students to become creative independent researchers who can contribute within an academic environment. Second, it will educate undergraduates to navigate a work environment which values creative independent investigation."
0.328312,"Future astronomical surveys will be producing such enormous quantities of data that new analysis methods are becoming imperative. Especially when large quantities of information must be distilled into theoretical insights, and the individual items are themselves actually of less certainty, a probability-based approach offers impressive advantages. This project will generate toolkits to implement such novel approaches to the extraction of knowledge from overwhelmingly large data sets. With the potential to transform the way science is done both in cosmology and in other areas under threat of being swamped with data, the impact of this work cannot be overestimated. The methods will both use and propagate collaborations with applied mathematics that make the impossible possible.<br/><br/>New cosmological surveys will require measurement of smaller signals using larger numbers of galaxies which are individually observed at lower confidence. This will require data analyses that are as information-preserving as possible. This project will create new methods for cosmological data analysis that permit inferences using not lossy, derived data products, such as galaxy catalogs, best-fit redshifts, or correlation function point estimates, but something much closer to the original imaging and spectroscopic data. These techniques will be informed by the principles of probabilistic inference and applied-mathematics technology. The work creates three related toolsets. Toolset 1 is for reconstruction and marginalization of cosmological density fields, which could be the mass, galaxy, or neutral-gas density field, or the two-dimensional projected mass density. Toolset 2 is for cosmological inference that makes proper use of probabilistic information about galaxy and quasar redshifts, improving probabilistic redshift information, and providing informative imputation of missing redshifts, thereby producing predictions and tools for smaller-scale scientific questions. Toolset 3 is for propagation of probabilistic image-level quantities such as galaxy shapes and the point-spread function, into weak-lensing studies of large-scale structure. This will permit inference from survey data conditional priors over galaxy shapes, and use them in a justified forward-modeling measurement of the shear field and cosmological parameters. The toolsets from this project will be the first practical methods for cosmological inference and large-scale structure measurement that can make full and proper, justified, use of probabilistic outputs. For the first time, it will be possible to perform simultaneous inference or refinement of catalog-level properties along with large-scale structure and cosmological inferences. Simultaneous inference will significantly reduce statistical biases in cosmological measurements, and also reduce variance in catalog-level quantities.<br/><br/>The toolsets will be papers and methods but also open-source codebases, with benefits beyond cosmology. These developments will help create standards for generating and delivering probabilistic outputs. The research will reach populations inside and outside academia by producing pedagogical papers on inference, data analysis, and computational statistics in the physical sciences."
0.634777,"The current cosmological paradigm includes two significant and unknown physical entities called ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy."" This project aims to test this paradigm by extracting cosmological information from the latest large-scale structure surveys of galaxies. The methods employed will yield substantial improvements over standard two-point measurements such as the power spectrum, and they will ultimately provide tighter constraints on cosmological parameters. Specifically, the project's primary goals are (1) to measure and interpret the power spectrum and bispectrum in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), (2) to improve current theoretical models of galaxy bias and redshift-space distortions, (3) to test large-scale modifications of gravity, proposed to explain the current acceleration of the Universe, by using redshift-space distortions of galaxy clustering in BOSS, and (4) to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity, motivated by inflationary models.<br/><br/>The educational broader impacts of this project include funding for two graduate students for three years at NYU and will be part of their PhD thesis work, and the investigators will give seminars to middle school and high school science teachers and to science education graduate students at NYU's Department of Teaching and Learning. For the scientific community the investigators will provide (1) publicly available computer code for cosmological simulations, specifically to generate non-Gaussian initial conditions, and (2) public mock galaxy catalogues produced by computer simulations."

0.02,"From the very beginnings of medieval thought about the year 1200 until 1687, the year Isaac Newton published his monumental Principia, the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic geocentric cosmology dominated intellectual debate about the nature of our universe. Professor Grant is examining how the Aristotelian system managed to persist for nearly half a millennium. To understand this phenomenon is to understand the ability of received views to persist, even in the light of contradictory evidence. Or, better, to understand the persistence of the Aristotelian system is to understand how a scientific theory can adapt to accommodate new views and to understand how extraordinarily difficult it is to overthrow entrenched views. By undertaking this study, Professor Grant is thus shedding light on one of the most important issues in science studies: how science changes--and why it does not change. Professor Grant has found that the nearly 500 year period can be divided into two parts: 1200-1500 when the Aristotelian view was overwhelmingly dominant and had no viable rivals. The second phase from 1500-1687 was one in which a number of rival cosmologies appeared ranging from the Platonic views to those of the hermetic tradition of Hermes Trismagistus. He has found that, even if Copernicus had never written De revolutionibus, a significant debate about the earth's possible axial rotation and orbital motion would have occurred. Yet in 1543, Copernicus did publish his revolutionary views and the remaining century and a half of Aristotelian cosmology was one of trying to accommodate the Aristotelian system to the discoveries which emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries--from Brahe's new observations of the planets and stars to Galileo's telescopic discoveries. The results of Professor Grant's study will be a massive history of Aristotelian cosmology. This study will have major importance for studies in the history and the philosophy of science which are concerned with the central issues of scientific change."
0.04,"In Einstein's theory of general relativity classical spacetime ends at the singularities. Examples include the Big Bang singularity in cosmological models and the central singularity of the black hole spacetimes. At these events the spacetime curvature and tidal forces become infinite. Classical evolution stops. It has been hoped that quantum gravitational effects will provide insights on resolution of this fundamental problem. This Faculty Early CAREER award supports research towards answering various questions related to quantum gravity and resolution of singularities in cosmological and black hole spacetimes. The research carried out in this project will use techniques of loop quantum gravity. A primary objective will be to establish generic properties of quantum spacetime in presence of anisotropies and inhomogenities, and extract reliable phenomenological and observational predictions. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are designed to address a wide audience. The project aims to enhance the scientific enrichment of K-12 students via a public lecture series and science exhibitions and demonstrations. Active engagement techniques will be used to revamp undergraduate and graduate courses. Undergraduate and graduate students will also receive training through research activities.<br/><br/>Detailed implications of the singularity resolution on the physics in different models will be explored. The project aims to significantly broaden and advance our current understanding of the physics of quantum gravity. Research explorations will include (i) systematically investigating the quantization and resulting physics of different spacetimes including anisotropies, inhomogenities in Gowdy models and Schwarzschild black holes, (ii) extracting phenomenological implications by analyzing effects of quantum gravity on cosmological perturbations, and (iii) addressing fundamental issues in quantum cosmology using consistent histories approach. Numerical techniques developed in this project will also lead to fresh insights on results in the classical gravity, such as on the structure of spacetime near classical singularities."
0.171306,"Einstein's theory of General Relativity is known to break down (become singular) when gravitational fields become sufficiently strong. The Big Bang is an example. A similar breakdown in electromagnetism on the atomic scale is cured by switching to a theory that obeys the principles of quantum mechanics. It is hoped that a quantum theory of gravity will remove the singularities in General Relativity. The research performed under this award aims to provide new insights and discover novel directions to answer fundamental questions on the removal (or resolution) of these singularities. Quantum gravitational effects will be systematically taken into account to understand the way singularities in cosmological and black hole spacetimes are resolved. By building on quantum cosmology (the quantization of simple model universes), investigations on more complex models will be performed with the goal of yielding insights on the generic resolution of singularities in quantum gravity. Phenomenological models will be built to understand broad ramifications of the quantum gravity effects in the cosmological scenarios. Another goal of the research will to be address related foundational issues in quantum cosmology, such as a consistent way to assign probabilities for events in a quantum universe.<br/><br/>This research will lead to deeper understanding of the new physics at the quantum gravity (Planck) scale that will have broad implications for quantum gravity, cosmology and other areas of physics. The research on singularity resolution in different models will provide useful hints on the full theory of quantum gravity. This NSF award will also lead to a training of a graduate student leading to a long term impact on his/her research career. Results obtained in this award will be disseminated to the scientific community by writing scholarly articles and seminars in conferences and workshops. The fundamental questions addressed in this award also have broad interest of the general public. Results will be disseminated to the public in various ways including contributions to the loop quantum gravity website."

Brandenberger of Brown University, to collaborate in theoretical physics with Professor Christoph Schmid and others of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) and the University of Zurich. These research groups represent centers of excellence that share an interest in understanding the physics of the very early universe. The participants bring complementary expertise in particle physics, field theory, astrophysics, and cosmology to the cooperative effort. A collateral goal of the proposed project is to enable the junior U.S. and Swiss participants to broaden their intellectual horizons through international collaboration. The joint research will focus on three topics of mutual interest: 1) applications of the theory of cosmological perturbations to gravitation and cosmology; 2) application of entropy arguments to the theory of cosmological phase transitions; and 3) construction of a nonsingular universe. This research addresses several intriguing questions about the physics of the early universe. The combinations of different backgrounds and perspectives among the participants increases the potential contribution of the research toward improved understanding of the formation of large scale structures in the universe. This area of cosmology is particularly interesting now because of recent and planned satellite observations that measure anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and the clusters, superclusters and the walls and voids of galaxies. These observations may provide means of evaluating and refining the models and otherwise advancing the research of the U.S. and Swiss collaborators. ***"

The proposed research deals with the role which topological defects that arise in many particle physics models play in cosmology, and conversely, with the constraints that can be put on particle physics models by investigating their cosmological consequences. Topological defects are playing an increasing role in cosmology. They are invoked in many theories to explain the origin of galaxies, clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe. Specifically, it is proposed to study the microphysics of topological defects. Cosmological consequences of some non-standard particle physics models will also be explored. These studies may provide new information about the state of matter at energies which will never be accessible in accelerators. This project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the US investigator in cosmological applications and the experience in field theory of the British collaborator."
0.1,"Abstract: PHY - 0653563 <br/>Title: Connecting Fundamental Physics and Cosmology<br/>PI Mark Trodden<br/>Institution: Syracuse University<br/><br/>The case for cosmic acceleration presents cosmology with two of its most pressing problems: the magnitude of the dark energy, since the expected size of the cosmological constant is entirely inconsistent with observation; and the coincidence problem - why is the fraction of the critical density in dark energy is the same order of magnitude as that in matter today. These concerns join other fundamental unsolved problems - the nature of dark matter, the origin of the baryon asymmetry, and the fundamental origin of inflation or other physics of the early universe. A central part of the proposal is the development of a suite of tests to (a) establish the theoretical viability of dark energy and modified gravity models and (b) to distinguish such models from one another and from the default case of a cosmological constant. The P.I. will investigate the extent to which there are relationships between modified gravity and dark energy models; the P.I. will map out and explore the territory of possible modifications to gravity with the potential to drive late-time cosmic acceleration; and the P.I. will perform a general study of cosmological perturbation theory in modified source gravity and on a class of models in which the <br/>Gravitational action is a general function of curvature invariants. <br/>The P.I. further proposes to carry out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of coupled <br/>dark energy-matter models, focusing on the stability of these models. The P.I. also proposes a systematic study of the cosmological consequences of models arising <br/>from compactified higher dimensional theories of particle physics and gravity; in particular, whether there are specific signatures that might be accessible to future <br/>supernovae studies, lensing surveys, large-scale structure measurements and collider experiments. <br/>The dominant broader impact of the proposed research is in public science education; bringing cutting edge science to the public, including populations traditionally underrepresented in physics. <br/>The P.I. has been a co-P.I. on Cosmic Connections, an NSF-funded project to construct modern cosmology exhibits for display in the Milton J.

0.045,"Flux Compactification of M-theory, Cosmology and the Standard Model of Elementary Particles <br/>PI: Melanie Becker <br/>Institution: University of Maryland <br/><br/>One of the goals of this proposal is to construct phenomenologically realistic models that can explain the small and positive cosmological constant recorded by the WMAP data, supernova observations and the HST data. Explaining the value of the cosmological constant has been a challenging problem for theoretical physics since ancient times. String theory does now have the basic tools to address this question very precisely as will be suggested in this proposal. With the same precision it is possible to address cosmology, inflation and the structure of our current universe. A crucial ingredient to answer these questions is string theory and M-theory compactifications with non-vanishing fluxes. Several projects will be suggested along this direction. Due to the duality between supergravity and strongly coupled gauge theories, important issues such as confinement in QCD could in principle be naturally described in this context. The proposed work largely explores the 'landscape' of string theory, the space of dynamically interesting string compactifications. This is an area of growing and long-term significance in string theory. The PI explores in this proposal new types of compactifications, namely heterotic M-theory and non-Kahler, whereas most earlier work has focused on the IIB flux models (which the PI also helped pioneer)."

0.804614,"Understanding the origin of our Universe remains a primary quest of astrophysicists, and such studies of cosmology advance our mastery of fundamental physics, which in turn leads to technological advances that accelerate our nation's economy. This project focuses on deep maps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization that offer tremendous opportunities for cosmology and fundamental physics. Most cosmologists believe that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a fraction of a second by the superluminal ""inflation"" of a subnuclear volume. Inflation produced a cosmic gravitational background (CGB) that may be detectable now via the faint signature imprinted in ""B-mode"" patterns of degree-scale CMB polarization. Their amplitude directly measures the energy scale of the inflationary Big Bang. Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB may be the most important goal in cosmology today. At arcminute scales CMB polarization traces gravitational lensing from the high redshift Universe, measuring early dark energy and neutrino mass. Where they overlap, such measurements will allow delensing of inflationary CGB searches, enabling better constraints of inflationary physics.<br/><br/>The BICEP/SPUD series of experiments operating from the South Pole have pursued a targeted strategy toward this important science goal. BICEP1 produced the best current published upper limit on inflation from B-modes. Dr. Kovac is now principal investigator (PI) of the collaboration that fielded, operates, and analyzes data from BICEP2 and SPUD. The combined BICEP2/SPUD system concentrates its sensitivity on a small foreground-clean region to optimize the search for the CGB. As other CMB polarization surveys come online in the near future, demand will grow for joint analysis of overlapping maps. Given the major implications of a B-mode detection, any claim will need to be confirmed by rigorous map-level comparisons among independent experiments. Separation of polarized Galactic emission and removal of contributions of gravitational lensing to the B-mode signature also require the joint use of surveys. The study of dark energy and neutrinos and other science goals motivate correlation of CMB maps with optical and radio cosmological surveys.<br/><br/>This project seeks to share ultra-deep CMB polarization maps from SPUD, BICEP2, BICEP1, and DASI. It develops and disseminates complete data products and software tools that broaden the use and impact of those pathfinding surveys while setting what are expected to be useful standards for others to do the same. This project aims to derive the needed portable data products and software tools, to test them in key joint analyses of overlapping maps with external collaborators including SPT, to share them with the full astrophysics community, and to encourage independent reanalysis. Such reanalysis by the astrophysics community, strongly motivated by the science goals above, may also yield unanticipated discoveries.<br/><br/>This project integrates education with research by directly broadening the audience for CMB science. The PI will develop and share a portable curriculum based on a highly successful CMB discovery laboratory aimed at undergraduate students, which will be used across many undergraduate teaching institutions. The PI will also publish virtual tours of the early Universe and interactive deep CMB maps, which may directly image primordial gravitational waves, through the WorldWide Telescope, a web-based astronomy visualization tool used for public and secondary-school educational outreach.

0.25743,"Hewitt<br/>AST-0071181<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to use gravitational lensing of high redshift radio sources to study cosmology and the mass distribution within galaxies which act as lenses. The program has several aspects: (1) Use of the VLA to identify ~ 10 additional strong lenses in the south. 2) use of the VLA and VLBA to monitor several lenses to measure time delays, and thus constrain Ho (and with statistics on 10 or more sources) also constrain lambda (3) modeling of galaxy mass distributions, using new modeling techniques based on Taylor expansions of the gravitational potential and (4) searching for supermassive black holes in the centers of lensing galaxies intermediate z galaxies by imaging the expected faint second images of extended background radio galaxies with the VLBA. The lensing technique provides a method for determining Ho and lambda which is independent of the more classical magnitude distance methods.<br/><br/><br/>Gravitational lensing occurs when radiation from a background astrophysical source passes by a foreground massive object. A special case is ""strong lensing"" where more than one image of the background source is produced. Strong lensing provides a unique laboratory for probing mass distributions, the geometry of the space between the source and the observer (cosmology) This work will carry out studies of gravitational lensing with the goal of measuring the distance scale and probing the geometry of the universe, investigating the mass distribution in galaxies, and determining whether intermediate-redshift galaxies harbor supermassive black holes at their centers. To do this we need a large, well understood, sample of lenses. A large radio survey of the southern sky, aimed at identifying new gravitational lens systems, we expect to identify between 5 and 10 new lens systems. Applying lens systems to the astrophysics problems listed above requires several related observational and theoretical programs. With the goal of measuring time delays, monitoring observations of newly identified lens systems, and of some known systems for which time delays have not yet been measured, will be carried out. These time delay measurements provide distance estimates, which in turn provide information on the distance scale in the universe and constrain cosmological models. In particular, gravitational lens distance measurements may be used to test the recent claim, based on Type Ia Supernova measurements, that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Mass distributions in lensing galaxies will be studied by applying a recently developed multipole-Taylor expansion of the gravitational potential to all lens systems, and by searching for faint second images of background sources that should be present if there are supermassive black holes at the galaxies' centers.

Yet the complexity of algorithms combined with the difficulty of parallelizing them on such large machines remains a hindrance to advances in Science and Engineering. This project explores an object based methodology that is simplifying the process of developing highly efficient parallel applications. This approach allows users to write applications at the level of natural entities in the application domain, without explicit regard to which processors will house such entities and<br/>carry out associated computations. To make this possible, the ""runtime system"" must be able to make fine-grained resource allocation decisions automatically. Advances in parallel computing are being sought to that end. Specifically, application developers may specify a program in terms of a collection of millions of objects that communicate with each other in several stylized patterns. In addition, parallel components can be plugged in and out of running computations, and exchange data with each other in a exible manner. Based on this infrastructure, this project is building a framework that makes it easy to build ""particle-oriented"" parallel programs. In addition to computational cosmology, which predomi-nately involves simulations that represent galaxies, dark matter, stars, planetary bodies and gas as particles, such programs are used in other fields as well. The framework contains highly efficient parallel algorithms that operate on collections of billions of particles, spread across machines with tens of thousands of processors. These advances are being used to carry out scientific studies in cosmology. Large, detailed simulations of structure formation powered by parallel computers are necessary to make quantitative predictions from cosmological theories. By calculating the non-linear gravitational and gas dynamics of the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, we are creating galaxy catalogues, X-ray maps, and other observables that can be compared directly with new satellite and ground-based data, and thereby constrain the parameters of cosmological theories. These parameters include the amount and nature of the dark matter, the existence and equation of state of any dark energy, the total amount of baryons, and the nature of the initial uctuations in the Universe. Similar simulation studies are being used to study how planets form from a proto-solar disk in order to create an ab initio theory of planet formation. The software developed via this project is being made available to a wide community of researchers. Also, the research results of simulations can be downloaded or visualized via the web."
0.07993,"The objective of this research is to evolve generic initial data for cosmological models to determine its asymptotic behavior. So far, this method has been successfully applied to the plane symmetric (vacuum) Gowdy cosmology on the 3- torus where strong support for its conjectured velocity dominated singularity has been obtained and interesting nonlinear interactions between the two polarizations of gravitational waves in the model have been observed. Cosmological observations indicate that, on the largest distance scales, the dynamics of the Universe today can be described by Einstein's theory of general relativity. It has long been known that, followed backward in time, Einstein's equations imply that a singular state of infinite density and temperature (the Big Bang) occurred a finite time ago. However, the nature of this predicted generic singularity is not known. The primary focus of this research is a long term numerical study to determine the nature of the generic cosmological singularity."

The project presents a coherent program that will build up a picture of the state of the intergalactic medium at high redshifts and its relationship and probe of cosmology. Large cosmological hydrodynamic simulations will be used to make predictions for observational measurements and to devise and test analysis techniques to be applied to data.

In addition, the sheer size of the data set will have a broad impact on the way spectroscopy is viewed, moving the study and mapping of the intergalactic medium into the realm of large-scale data mining. This work will push the development of software tools there were not previously necessary when analysis of quasar spectra involved only a small number of objects<br/><br/>Educationally, this project will assist the education of undergraduate and graduate students, and the results will be incorporated into an ongoing outreach program working with middle school students from minorities underrepresented in science."

This work will utilize the Adaptive Refinement Tree (ART) cosmological simulation code. Specific goals are: (1) to achieve petascale level performance for the ART cosmological code by improving load balancing, communication performance, and the hybrid parallelization mode on multi-core/multi-processor nodes on petascale platforms; (2) to develop a robust fault-tolerance mechanism for petascale ART simulations; (3) to provide a user-level interface and documentation for public release of ART under an open source license; and (4) to produce state-of-the-art cosmological simulations that will result in a rich scientific output and a valuable repository of simulation results for the astrophysical community.

The ultimate result of this project - a publicly available, open source petascale cosmological simulation code - will be of great value for the general astrophysics community, and will be widely used, as shown by the widespread usage of other, currently existing, publicly available cosmological codes. The code can also be used as a calibration tool for current and pending dark energy experiments. On a broader scale, this project will have a direct impact on undergraduate education and the general public. Visualizations of cosmological simulations of the kind proposed here trigger a curiosity and a sense of discovery in the general public afforded only by the exploration of the universe.

0.4,"The standard models of particle physics and cosmology are incomplete. The particle content does not contain a viable candidate for the dark matter in the Universe and there is no well-motivated explanation of the nature of dark energy. The fields of particle physics and cosmology are inextricably intertwined. Accelerator-based experiments, detectors in deep underground mines, and telescopes in space and on the ground are all needed and used to explore fundamental questions such as the nature of dark matter. Gravitational lensing is a cosmological probe that has the advantage of being sensitive to all matter in the Universe: baryonic and dark matter. The growth of dark matter structure is a sensitive probe of the physics of dark energy. <br/><br/>With this award, the Stanford group will play a leadership role in a high-priority effort in observational cosmology through the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. The LSST is the first ground-based telescope being designed from scratch to address the severe demands on systematic uncertainties needed to fully exploit weak gravitational lensing as a cosmological probe. The LSST will also address cosmological questions through studies of the growth of large scale structure, baryon acoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae. The group will study the experimental challenges to achieving the maximum sensitivity to dark energy through several observational probes, with a focus on gravitational lensing. This effort will be based on analytical and computational techniques, and on detailed simulations of the LSST system. They will contribute to the development of high fidelity simulations and, where appropriate, use existing imaging data to develop and test the understanding of systematic effects that will impact LSST. <br/><br/>The work with LSST simulations and astronomical data provides opportunities for students and postdocs to gain skills in statistics, data analysis, and handling large data sets that are in high demand in the private and public sectors.

0.3,"Abstract<br/>AST 98-75031<br/>Ratra<br/><br/>The current flood of cosmological data, including cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy observations, enables inter- comparison of a broad range of cosmological models. The CMB (and other) data will be compared with several models to determine the tightest possible constraints on cosmological parameter values, and so test theories of the very early universe. The successful conclusion of this program will have profound consequences for astronomical and laboratory searches for dark matter in the Universe, extragalactic astrophysics, general relativity, and very high-energy particle physics. The excitement engendered by, and the conceptual simplicity of CMB anisotropy experiments makes it possible to directly involve undergraduates in frontier research, and to expand the physics curriculum to include aspects of modern cosmology research.<br/><br/>This integrated research and education plan for career development will take advantage of opportunities afforded by the new data. Physics undergraduates will mathematically characterize CMB anisotropy experiments and determine the angular scales to which they are sensitive (their ""window functions""). A Web site will be developed to disseminate these window functions, thus providing a uniform and highly accurate characterization of all CMB experiments (a resource that will be of great use for theorists and experimentalists). Novel but observationally consistent cosmogonies will be developed. CMB anisotropies will be computed in these models, for a wide range of cosmological parameters. Improved statistical techniques (that account for experimental systematic uncertainties) will be developed to use these predictions, in conjunction with the CMB experimental window functions and data, to constrain cosmological parameters. Correlation techniques will be used to compare the microwave data to possible foreground contaminant data, to assess the amount of, and remove any non-CMB foreground contamination. Results from analyses of many CMB experiments will be combined with those from analyses of other cosmological data to determine the tightest possible constraints on cosmological-parameter values, and so test cosmic structure formation models. The favored models will be used to make predictions for what should be seen by the MAP and Planck Surveyor space missions.<br/>An upper-level undergraduate and graduate cosmogony curriculum, that incorporates topics of current research and uses interactive multimedia tools, will be developed. This will be complemented by focussed lecture series, reading courses, and special departmental colloquia from well-established cosmologists. The goal is to help students develop the quantitative reasoning abilities needed for research in this exciting area of modern physics, and that will serve them well for possible employment in any technology-related field. The research of the Kansas State University Physics Education Group on effective physics teaching and learning will be utilized while designing this curriculum. Their expertise, assistance, and infrastructure will be used to extend this curriculum to the introductory level, to sustain the natural curiosity of students for things astronomical, and to attract students from traditionally under-represented groups to physics. The longer-range goal is to develop a partially Web-based, introductory cosmogony course into a completely Web-based distance-learning one.<br/>The extensive overlap between the educational and research activities is deliberately designed to ensure that they reinforce each other.

17.0,"Cosmology and particle physics stand at a crossroads. In recent years, scientists have put together a remarkably successful model of cosmic evolution and the extraordinarily well tested Standard Model of elementary particles. In the current cosmological model, a rapid burst of expansion - inflation - occurred a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, laying the seeds for the formation of structure in the Universe. Those seeds have been observed as hot and cold regions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The assembly of galaxies from those seeds and the vast web of large-scale structure seen in galaxy surveys was shaped by dark matter, which dominates the mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the evidence that the cosmic expansion is now accelerating has become incontrovertible, pointing to a Universe dominated by dark energy or else to a modification of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.<br/><br/>The success of the current cosmology rests upon its three mysterious pillars - inflation, particle dark matter, and dark energy - mysterious because they lie outside the Standard Model of particle physics. Cosmology has shown that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there is new physics waiting to be discovered. In the coming decade, cosmology can help reveal the new physics underlying inflation, dark matter, and cosmic acceleration, and thereby play a critical role in pointing the way to a new paradigm for fundamental physics. The Physics Frontier Center at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) will bring together astronomers and physicists, theorists, observers and experimentalists, and early-career scientists and senior researchers from across the cosmology community. Since the complexity of these problems requires multiple, complementary approaches, the Center will enable datasets from different experiments to be combined in powerful new ways. As new discoveries are made, the Center will pursue new directions to promptly follow them up. <br/><br/>Building upon the accomplishments, investments, and lessons learned over the past ten years of PFC funding, the Center focuses upon reaping the science from the projects that were initiated and developed at the KICP - South Pole Telescope (SPT), Dark Energy Survey (DES), Q/U Imaging Experiment (QUIET), and Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics (COUPP) - and elsewhere to help solve these big mysteries. Built around the projects, the Center includes eight Major Activities (MAs), five research Hubs, an international Fellows exchange program, yearly hands-on summer schools, and multiple Education & Outreach partnerships. Twenty-one key collaborators have committed to carrying out specific tasks central to the Center. They come from local institutions, education and outreach partners, institutions around the country, and industry. <br/><br/>Three science MAs are devoted to our research themes: the Inflation MA will take advantage of dramatic advances in measuring CMB polarization to pursue the ""Bmode"" polarization signature of inflation-produced gravity waves, focusing initially on QUIET and SPTpol while laying the groundwork for future experiments. It will also combine CMB and large-scale structure measurements from DES to test whether the underlying density perturbations are Gaussian, as predicted by the simplest models of inflation. The Dark Energy MA will use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) and other future projects to probe the physical origin of cosmic acceleration and test the current paradigm - vacuum energy within Einstein's theory of gravity. The Dark Matter MA will synthesize the upcoming wealth of data from particle colliders, satellites, and ultra-sensitive dark matter detectors to confirm or refute the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) hypothesis for dark matter.<br/><br/>Within the three science MAs, five research ""Hubs"" will bring people and projects together to focus on specific challenges. The CMB Polarization Hub will facilitate coordination between different polarization experiments, including joint analysis; the non-Gaussianity Hub will bring together international researchers to constrain or detect non-Gaussianity and test inflation. The Joint Analysis Hub will bring together researchers on SPT and DES and other projects to develop and apply new tools to exploit and optimize galaxy clusters as probes of dark energy; the Supernova Hub will carry out a broad program to improve supernovae as cosmological distance indicators and apply these techniques to new surveys. The Dark Matter Hub will focus on particle theory and model building and signals for dark matter from colliders and indirect detection experiments, complementing the direct detection experiment COUPP and others.<br/><br/>The Fellows MA is the centerpiece activity of the Center. Mentored by the faculty of the Center but given great independence, eleven early-career scientists will be able to shape research programs of their own design, work with faculty, other Fellows, students, and visitors in the interdisciplinary environment of the Center. They can also participate in an international Fellows exchange program and choose from a broad range of opportunities in education and outreach. All of this is designed to prepare them to be future leaders in cosmology.<br/><br/>Two MAs are devoted to crosscutting, science-enabling activities. Detector Development, strongly leveraged by partnerships with Argonne, Fermilab, and other institutions, will develop innovative detectors to position us to take advantage of early discoveries and to broadly benefit cosmology and other areas of science. Computational Cosmology will coordinate the high-performance computing resources, both human and hardware, necessary to accomplish our science goals. The Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will provide a program of specialized workshops, large symposia, yearly hands-on summer schools, and a visitors program featuring the David Schramm Distinguished Visiting Professorship to engage and benefit the broader cosmology community and further our science goals.<br/><br/>By design, the broader impacts of the PFC are woven throughout the Center activities. More specifically, the Education, Outreach, & Diversity MA, will spearhead and coordinate a series of activities aimed at broadening the impact of the Center. This MA is strongly coupled to the science in the Center, involves 100% of the PFC faculty members, and has three overarching goals: increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce through programs from K-12 to the professoriate; educating and preparing the next generation of teacher-scholars in an interdisciplinary environment by involving students and Fellows directly in outreach and teaching activities; and advancing the public's understanding and appreciation of science through collaborations with museums and planetariums, and through public lectures and events. This approach to broadening participation includes collaboration with Project Exploration working with the Chicago Public Schools, continuation of the successful Space Explorers K-12 program, partnering with the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge program and the University of Texas El Paso to bring students to UChicago for research experiences, supporting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and championing diversity in faculty hiring and retention within the Physical Sciences Division at UChicago. The Center will also use technology, developing visualization tools, to integrate research into the undergraduate curriculum and will partner with the Adler Planetarium on cosmology visualizations for a broader audience. Finally, the Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will promote dissemination of cutting-edge research to the broader cosmology community and offer opportunities for those not currently engaged in cosmology research to transition into the field."
0.024154,"The United States and the Soviet Union are probably the two leading countries in both astrophysics and cosmology. Cooperative research in these areas, however, have not been common in the past. This workshop will provide an important opportunity to strongly stimulate long-term joint cooperation in an area of research which is of great interest to the world-wide scientific community. The thematic focus of the workshop, which is being organized by Dr. Adrian L. Melott of the University of Kansas and Dr. Sergey F. Shandarin of the Institute of Physical Problems of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, is the legacy of Yakov B. Zel'dovich in Astrophysics and Cosmology. One of the most important figures in twentieth-century cosmology, Zel'dovich (who died in 1987) was responsible for fundamental advances in these areas that are being actively investigated today. The workshop will involve some 10 to 15 scientists from each country, including 5-10 young investigators from each side. The workshop will include an opening session on the future of cosmology, which will be open to the public and oriented to their understanding, as well as a three-day scientific program will consist of a series of brief presentations followed by extended discussion periods. Selected observers will be permitted to attend. Participants will be invited to use the final day for the development of collaborative relationships and preparation of specific proposals for long-term cooperative research for subsequent submission and competitive review. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complemen- tary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit."
0.135,"New precision Astronomical observations have spurred the development of a ?concordance? cosmological model, based on inflation and having three components to the energy present in the universe: ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy. The model is constrained by a variety of high-quality, independent measurements such as large-scale structure, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), gravitational lensing, the primordial abundances of light elements, and Type-IA Supernovae used as standard candles. The objective of the proposed research is to develop and apply theoretical techniques that use cosmological observations to constrain the physics of the early universe, focusing specifically on the successful paradigm of inflation. Inflation?s basic predictions of Gaussian, adiabatic, nearly scale-invariant cosmological perturbations have been beautifully confirmed by recent data, in particular the WMAP 3-year data set. Upcoming observations have the potential to provide data accurate enough to test inflation beyond a simple lowest-order description. This proposal focuses on four possible signals of new physics which might be detected in future data: Features in the density power spectrum, Primordial gravitational waves, primordial non-Gaussianity and Isocurvature fluctuations.The proposed research is designed to make detailed and quantitative connections between observational data and several properties of inflationary models. Based on high-precision cosmological data one hopes to answer fundamental questions such as the origin of the universe, the unification of gravitation with quantum mechanics, and the quantum-mechanical nature of the vacuum. The proposed project will have significant opportunities for participation by graduate and undergraduate students. There is wide public interest in cosmology. The PI intends to give public lectures on Cosmology at university and community events."
0.119804,"Flux Compactification of M-theory, Cosmology and the Standard Model of Elementary Particles <br/>PI: Melanie Becker <br/>Institution: University of Maryland <br/><br/>One of the goals of this proposal is to construct phenomenologically realistic models that can explain the small and positive cosmological constant recorded by the WMAP data, supernova observations and the HST data. Explaining the value of the cosmological constant has been a challenging problem for theoretical physics since ancient times. String theory does now have the basic tools to address this question very precisely as will be suggested in this proposal. With the same precision it is possible to address cosmology, inflation and the structure of our current universe. A crucial ingredient to answer these questions is string theory and M-theory compactifications with non-vanishing fluxes. Several projects will be suggested along this direction. Due to the duality between supergravity and strongly coupled gauge theories, important issues such as confinement in QCD could in principle be naturally described in this context. The proposed work largely explores the 'landscape' of string theory, the space of dynamically interesting string compactifications. This is an area of growing and long-term significance in string theory. The PI explores in this proposal new types of compactifications, namely heterotic M-theory and non-Kahler, whereas most earlier work has focused on the IIB flux models (which the PI also helped pioneer)."

The goal of the research is the determination of the structure in the universe and the discrimination among various cosmological models. They will perform analyses of observational data, and use some of the largest cosmological model simulations available to date to address the following topics: (1) Investigate the large-scale structure in the universe using galaxy clusters, superclusters, quasars, radio galaxies, and pencil-beam surveys as tracers, and integrate the results into a unified picture; (2) Use large-scale computer simulations of cosmological models to compare the observations with predictions from different models; and, (3) Study the detailed properties--in optical, X-ray, and optical-to-X-ray cross-correlations of clusters of galaxies, the largest bound systems known. Implications regarding the cluster potential and dark-matter distribution, galaxy and hot gas distribution, velocity bias, and the nature of the intracluster medium will be derived and compared with cosmological simulations. The observational analysis and modeling will clarify the nature of galaxy clusters and of larger scale structure and constrain cosmological models. The Principal Investigator and her collaborators have successfully worked in these fields and are regarded as highly experienced in these research areas. ***"
0.330561,"Recent observations have shown that about 70% of the energy density in the universe cannot be attributed to matter. The simplest explanation of this `dark energy' comes from the cosmological constant that Einstein had initially introduced in his fundamental equations of general relativity. However, for most of the 20th century, it was widely believed that the cosmological constant is zero because all observations were compatible with this simplest possibility. Therefore, the detailed mathematical theories describing the dynamics of compact astronomical objects such as colliding black holes and neutron stars, and gravitational waves they source, was based on this assumption. The goal of the first part of this project is to systematically extend that theory to include a non-zero cosmological constant. The extension will provide a firmer foundation for gravitational wave science. The second part of the project contains studies at the interface of strong gravity and quantum physics. They address fundamental issues related to the quantum evaporation of black holes and the physics of the earliest epoch of our universe when gravity is strong and quantum physics indispensable. The proposed research will have an impact on a broad range of research areas, including general relativity, geometric analysis, cosmology, quantum field theory, and computational science. As a result, through this research, young scientists will be trained in inter-disciplinary science. Currently, these researchers include members of under-represented groups. Through his editorship of series commemorating the centennial of the discovery of general relativity, the PI will commission monographs aimed at communicating the latest advances in science and technology to young researchers. Finally, as in the past, personnel supported by this grant will contribute vigorously to outreach activities through videos, semi-popular articles and public lectures.<br/><br/>The first part of the project will address issues arising from the fact that even a tiniest value if the cosmological constant can cast a long shadow on the theory of gravitational waves. As of now, we do not even have a gauge invariant notion of gravitational waves in full, non-linear general relativity with a positive cosmological constant. The goal is to construct a rigorous framework to fill this gap and use it to extract the physics of gravitational waves in a more reliable fashion. The results will open new avenues for analytic and numerical work in the study of the gravitational collapse, compact binary coalescence, energy, momentum and angular momentum emission in such processes, post-Newtonian and post-Minkowskian approximation methods, etc. They are also likely to stimulate research in geometric analysis through new mathematical conjectures (related to positivity of a new notion of energy). The second part of the project will address two types of issues: i) the conceptually fundamental question of whether information is lost in evaporation of black holes; and, ii) the emerging interplay between loop quantum gravity and observations related to the very early universe. This is possible because loop quantum cosmology is now sufficiently mature to make predictions for future observations based on its pre-inflationary dynamics, and to use current observations to seek fundamental principles that presumably dictate the initial conditions for our universe."
0.225,"""This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).""<br/><br/><br/>The last decade has witnessed a revolution in our understanding of the early and present Universe with the confirmation that seeds of quantum mechanical origin are ultimately responsible for the formation of galaxies, and that 95% of the energy density in the Universe is in the form of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Forthcoming cosmological observations and accelerator experiments will reveal more awe inspiring phenomena that will challenge our understanding but present us with the opportunity of an unprecedented convergence of nuclear, particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The discovery that neutrinos have masses and mix ushered in a new era in which early Universe cosmology, large scale structure formation and stellar evolution combine with cosmological observations and accelerator experiments to offer a glimpse beyond the standard model of particle physics which may open the window towards deeper understanding of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. This project describes a continuation of interdisciplinary research efforts in early Universe Cosmology and Particle Physics. We present a program to assess neutrinos in extensions beyond the standard model as possible Dark Matter candidates by providing a comprehensive framework to study their production, evolution and gravitational clustering properties. We also seek to understand quantum processes and correlations during the inflationary stage in the early Universe and their potential observability with forthcoming measurements. This program is driven by and complements strong experimental and observational programs in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology, and implements a wide range of interdisciplinary methods borrowed from quantum optics and condensed matter out of equilibrium to provide a fundamental framework for the assessment of novel phenomena and explore their observable consequences.<br/>This is an interdisciplinary program at the forefront of nuclear and particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrinos not only open a window to physics beyond the standard model, but are the common link between nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The notion that the Universe that we see today was born out of small quantum fluctuations during an early phase of rapid expansion is awe inspiring, intellectually challenging and stimulating. Understanding the past and present of our Universe and the origin of the largest structures beginning from the smallest constituents, and opening a window to the early Universe with satellites, telescopes, detectors and accelerators are clearly some of the most fascinating intellectual questions, and undoubtedly one of the most challenging and rewarding endeavors. The broader impacts are as follows: Many of the aspects explored in this program, such as quantum kinetics and coherence are of broad interest across fields. Furthermore neutrino oscillations provide an arena to study macroscopic quantum coherence and the interplay between environmental decoherence and relaxation. The concepts and methods involved in this study are also relevant in condensed matter and quantum optics motivated by quantum computing. The appeal of studying the early Universe and some of the most exotic objects in the present Universe goes beyond the scientists working in these areas, and reaches out to the broad audience."

0.205804,"Abstract: PHY - 0653563 <br/>Title: Connecting Fundamental Physics and Cosmology<br/>PI Mark Trodden<br/>Institution: Syracuse University<br/><br/>The case for cosmic acceleration presents cosmology with two of its most pressing problems: the magnitude of the dark energy, since the expected size of the cosmological constant is entirely inconsistent with observation; and the coincidence problem - why is the fraction of the critical density in dark energy is the same order of magnitude as that in matter today. These concerns join other fundamental unsolved problems - the nature of dark matter, the origin of the baryon asymmetry, and the fundamental origin of inflation or other physics of the early universe. A central part of the proposal is the development of a suite of tests to (a) establish the theoretical viability of dark energy and modified gravity models and (b) to distinguish such models from one another and from the default case of a cosmological constant. The P.I. will investigate the extent to which there are relationships between modified gravity and dark energy models; the P.I. will map out and explore the territory of possible modifications to gravity with the potential to drive late-time cosmic acceleration; and the P.I. will perform a general study of cosmological perturbation theory in modified source gravity and on a class of models in which the <br/>Gravitational action is a general function of curvature invariants. <br/>The P.I. further proposes to carry out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of coupled <br/>dark energy-matter models, focusing on the stability of these models. The P.I. also proposes a systematic study of the cosmological consequences of models arising <br/>from compactified higher dimensional theories of particle physics and gravity; in particular, whether there are specific signatures that might be accessible to future <br/>supernovae studies, lensing surveys, large-scale structure measurements and collider experiments. <br/>The dominant broader impact of the proposed research is in public science education; bringing cutting edge science to the public, including populations traditionally underrepresented in physics. <br/>The P.I. has been a co-P.I. on Cosmic Connections, an NSF-funded project to construct modern cosmology exhibits for display in the Milton J.

As advances in computer power and software algorithms continue into the petascale regime, it will become possible to simulate the entire visible universe at high mass and spatial resolutions. This project will develop a new, petascale-optimized version of the gravity/hydrodynamics code GADGET, the most widely used cosmological simulation code, using an efficient and low-risk incremental strategy. Hybrid shared memory, load balancing and other improvements will allow the new p-GADGET to run on (of order) a million cores. p-GADGET will be applied to two fundamental problems for which current numerical methods fall short by a factor of a thousand. This includes the first hydrodynamical simulation capable of studying the formation of the vast range of quasars and galaxies, from the smallest to the rarest and most luminous, using well-tested algorithms for star formation, black hole formation, accretion, and feedback. p-GADGET will also create the ultimate dark matter simulation, one that fully resolves the mass function of dark matter halos by modeling every single clump that hosts a galaxy. Matching these results to our observed Universe will show whether or not we fully understand the astrophysical impact of dark matter on cosmology.<br/><br/>The public version of GADGET has been wildly successful. p-GADGET will similarly be publicly available, opening up the domain of efficient petascale science to a wide audience, and adding strongly to the user base of the first petascale machines.

At a general level as well as in key examples, new effective equations will be analyzed and derived systematically in the areas of quantum mechanics, quantum cosmology and quantum gravity. Results will be integrated in the teaching of undergraduate quantum mechanics and of quantum aspects in cosmology such as the emergence of structure in the universe. In new research, the nature of the big bang singularity in quantum cosmology will be analyzed, providing insights into the state of the universe at and before the big bang. Moreover, potentially observable effects of quantum gravity in the early universe and new phenomena in the quantum physics of black holes will be investigated. By focusing on effects rather than the underlying mathematics, comparisons with other approaches to quantum gravity will become possible.<br/>The issues addressed underlie our understanding of the universe and typically attract wide interest. New methods to be introduced make implications of quantum gravity accessible for the non-specialist and bridge the traditional gap between fundamental research in this area and cosmological phenomenology.

0.06,"AST-1109180/1109275/1108790<br/>Kahniashvili/Ratra/Kosowsky<br/><br/>Observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy, with defined field strength and coherence scale. Understanding the origin of these fields is one of the more challenging questions of modern astrophysics. There are currently two pictures: a bottom-up (astrophysical) one, generating the seed field on smaller scales, and a top-down (cosmological) version, generating the seed field prior to galaxy formation on scales that are now large. This project aims to answer several relevant questions: (i) How and when was the magnetic field generated? (ii) How does it evolve during the expansion of the universe? (iii) Can the amplitude and statistical properties of this seed magnetic field explain the properties of the observed magnetic fields in large-scale structures? (iv) Is the seed magnetic field detectable through cosmological observations? And if so, (v) what are the observational constraints on such a primordial magnetic field?<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary project divides into the following related parts: (1) determining intergalactic magnetic field limits from currently available data; (2) studying cosmological large-scale correlated magnetic field generation mechanisms; (3) numerically studying the evolution of the magnetic field during the expansion of the universe; (4) numerically studying seed magnetic field amplification and dynamics during galaxy formation; and (5) predicting observable signatures of a cosmological seed magnetic field. This unique team of experts will significantly improve the current understanding of the origin, evolution, observational limits, and predicted signatures, of a cosmic magnetic field. The research includes important work in high energy physics, data analysis and interpretation, numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic processes, and galaxy and early structure formation. Perhaps most importantly, there is a chance to establish that observations demand a cosmological magnetic field that cannot be generated by any mechanism operating within the confines of the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/><br/>The educational aspects include the training of undergraduate and graduate students.

17.572276,"The University of Chicago will lead a consortium of six institutions to design and utilize an eight-meter off-axis telescope at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in order to carry out a unique and powerful survey of galaxy clusters to unprecedented red shifts. This survey will allow the study of integrated cluster abundance and its red shift evolution, and will give us precise cosmological constraints, which are completely independent of those from supernovae distance and Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy measurements. The sample size and redshift depth will be ideally suited for using cluster abundance evolution to determine the equation of state of the dark energy component of the universe.<br/>One of the most important discoveries in cosmology is that it appears that much, if not most, of the mass in the Universe is made not of stars and glowing gas that is familiar to us from astronomical images of the sky, but of what has been termed dark matter. This dark matter emits little or no light or other electromagnetic radiation, and so far makes its presence known only through the gravitational force it exerts upon the luminous matter. There is some indication that the dark matter may in fact not even be baryonic. Just what fraction of the mass is in the form of non-interacting non-baryonic particles is of great interest to cosmologists and physicists.<br/>Measuring the mass in baryons along with the total mass in a region of the Universe that could be considered a ""fair sample"" would provide a crucial direct determination of the dark matter content. In recent years, just such a test-bed has been found in the guise of massive clusters of galaxies. These clusters contain large amounts of gas (baryons) in the form of a highly ionized atmosphere of gas at temperatures of millions of degrees, which emit X-rays. Nearly all of the baryons in the clusters are believed to be in the hot phase, and so it is likely that we are truly measuring the baryonic mass in the cluster.<br/>In addition to emitting X-rays, the hot cluster gas also scatters the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. This scattering, called the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE), is measurable using radio telescopes. The CMB has a blackbody temperature of 2.7 K which and a radiation spectrum that peaks at a wavelength of around lmm. Observations at centimeter wavelengths see the SZE as a distortion of the spectrum, i.e. as a reduction in the brightness toward the cluster as the photons are scattered toward a higher energy level. The observed decrement is proportional to the integrated electron density along the line-of-sight through the cluster.<br/>The Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect is important to the study of cosmology and the CMB for two main reasons. 1) The observed ""hotspots"" created by the kinetic effect will distort the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies. These need to be separated from the primary anisotropies in order to probe properties of inflation. 2) The thermal SZ effect can be measured and combined with x-ray observations in order to determine values of cosmological parameters, in particular the Hubble constant."

The Center will foster several new research initiatives aimed at seizing these opportunities while continuing a number of efforts begun in the first term of the Center that are now coming to fruition. The new initiatives will make strides toward the detection of inflationary gravity waves in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), probe the nature of the Dark Energy with a large optical survey, develop a promising, new method for detecting Dark Matter, and provide new pooled resources for the analysis of large experimental and theoretical data sets. <br/><br/>The integrated, cross-cutting program of research, education, and outreach aimed at fundamental questions in cosmological physics at the PFC-KICP is designed to capture the imagination of the public from K to 99 through its variety of activities with broader impact: (1) Training and educating scientists to work in teams, cross boundaries in their research, and integrate research and education, particularly through the Fellows program. (2) Disseminating important scientific results whose implications cut across the disciplines of astronomy and physics. (3) Using this exciting area of science to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering, with programs such as Space Explorers, WAP, UPRIDE, and RET. (4) Creating broadly shared infrastructure; e.g., the Sunyaev-Zel?dovich Array (SZA) will become part of the CARMA facility and the Dark Energy Camera will be a user instrument at CTIO; both will be broadly used by the astronomy community. (5) Sharing the excitement of this science and educating the public about the nature of science through a vigorous and diverse outreach program that includes cosmology short courses, museum partnerships, and public talks. (6) Engaging the broader cosmological physics community through a targeted program of workshops, visitors, and symposia."

The theoretical side of this project focuses on the statistics of galaxy clustering and the underpinnings of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Additional theoretical work will use hydrodynamic and N-body simulations to investigate the dependence on dark matter dynamics and on galaxy type, redshift, and cosmology. Different clustering statistics carry complementary information, and since the combination of a cosmological model with a specified HOD determines all aspects of galaxy clustering, in principle a large redshift survey can reveal the cosmological and galaxy parameters, independently. The techniques developed will be applied to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), yielding insights into galaxy formation physics and tightening constraints on cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>The most direct broader impacts will come through student training and graduate and undergraduate teaching, but the principal investigator is also involved in public outreach and significant community service. The research will also help to maximize the scientific return from the large investment in the SDSS, a major national resource."
0.038,"Cosmology came of age as a science during the 20th century because of the structuring of cosmological observation and theory around the Big Bang model of an expanding, evolving universe. Yet even though Big Bang Cosmology was undeniably scientific, it was scientific in a special way: Theory was always much richer than its empirical base. Hence, finding theoretical problems which interacted crucially with the limited data set was a difficult and delicate problem. In many instances, cosmologists found themselves forced to rely upon very general metaphysical principles, principles such as ""The Uniformity of Nature,"" ""Causality,"" and ""Simplicity,"" as decision criteria in the selection among competing problem solutions. Indeed, it can be argued that it was precisely these sorts of principles which opened the way for today's inflationary cosmologies. Big Bang cosmology offers a rich source for historians and philosophers of science interested in the dynamical interplay between empirical, theoretical and philosophical forces during the birth and development of a major scientific research programme. Professors Gale and Urani hope to examine under this study the dynamical interplay of these forces."
0.235,"Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provide a unique window to the early Universe and are playing a key role in the transformation of Cosmology to a precise science. The CMB is a powerful tool for the study of the Universe that is still far from being fully exploited. This proposal seeks support for continued analysis of data from the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR). ACBAR is a 16-element 230 microKelvin bolometer receiver that operated on the 2.1-m VIPER telescope at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Making full use of the excellent atmospheric conditions in the Austral winter at the South Pole, ACBAR has produced images of the CMB with sensitivity and resolution that exceed the capabilities of current balloon and satellite based telescopes. ACBAR accomplished it final season of observations and was decommissioned in December 2005. From the 2001-2003 observations, ACBAR produced high-resolution maps of the CMB fluctuations over a hundred square degrees of the lowest dust-contrast sky visible from the South Pole. However, during the 2004 and 2005 observational seasons, ACBAR tripled the sky coverage of earlier observations, including a deep image of same region of sky that was imaged in the long-duration balloon BOOMERanG 2003 flight. With these observations, it will be possible to cross-calibrate the BOOMERanG, ACBAR, and NASA's WMAP spacecraft experiments with an uncertainty of less than 2%. This uniform and precise calibration is necessary in order to realize the full potential of CMB observations to constrain cosmological parameters such as a running spectral index. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is multifaceted. This proposal will support the development and implementation of new algorithms for the analysis of large ground-based CMB datasets. These algorithms will be directly applicable to future ambitious experiments such as the South Pole 10-m Telescope. A full interpretation of the results requires a precise accounting of the effects of gravitational lensing and secondary anisotropies. The work outlined in this proposal will support the completion of PhD theses by three graduate students and will continue to involve undergraduate researchers in innovative research. The proposed work will have broad impact on the field of cosmology by producing measurements that are essential for the larger cosmology community engaged in the study of a diverse range of topics from inflation to the evolution of galaxy clusters. When combined with results from the WMAP experiment, ACBAR will provide precise constraints on cosmological parameters such as, dark matter density, running spectral index, and the size of matter density fluctuations. These measurements will play a key role in either supporting or refuting the emerging standard cosmological model. ACBAR will also place exciting new constraints on secondary anisotropies such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from distant galaxy clusters, and should be able to make the first detection of gravitational lensing of the CMB. Through this effort, ACBAR will serve as a pathfinder for the analysis of the results form the next generation of experiments."

0.059757,"ABSTRACT <br/>AST 0098506<br/>Zaldarriaga<br/><br/>This is a Collaborative Research Project with Lam Hui (0098437) of Columbia University.<br/><br/>The light from a quasar (also called a qso) often has multiple dips in intensity, or absorption lines, at positions corresponding to the redshifted Lyman alpha line (at rest wavelength 1216 angstroms) from neutral hydrogen. These often occur as a series of absorption lines, called the Lyman alpha forest. The redshift is caused by the expansion of the universe. If we can calculate<br/>how the universe is expanding (based on a cosmological model), we can tell where the photons were absorbed in relation to us. Thus, we can use the absorption map to plot the positions of<br/>clouds of intervening hydrogen between the quasar and us. The clouds in the Lyman alpha systems are not very massive compared to objects like galaxies. Because of this, reliable computer simulations (numerical experiments) of their gravitational collapse (formation) from primordial fluctuations are possible. These Lyman alpha forest simulations produce structure similar to what we see in the nearby universe (filaments, walls, and voids ) by starting with small fluctuations in matter density and then letting gravity and other known forces act. These detailed calculations of the structure and distribution of matter are at the frontiers of current research and <br/>these recent advances in computer modeling have made it possible to use observations of the Lyman-alpha forest at redshifts between 2 and 4 as powerful cosmological tools. <br/><br/>The forest has offered, and will continue to offer, interesting constraints on many quantities such as the amplitude and shape of the primordial mass power spectrum, the neutrino mass, the matter density, the cosmological constant, and the reionization epoch. These constraints, in conjunction with those from other observations, provide important checks on our fundamental understanding of cosmology.<br/><br/>This project will primarily focus on the ""transmission power spectrum"", a statistic used in cosmological models which is directly observable. The program has two goals:<br/>1) Examination of fundamental assumptions: The project will test several methods to address questions about the influence of continuum-fitting in determining the measured fluctuations in the forest , the interpretation of these fluctuations in terms of mass fluctuations resulting from gravitational instability, and the effect of fluctuations in the ionizing background and the effective equation of state of the intergalactic medium on the interpretation.<br/> 2) Maximizing the scientific return from the data: To this end the program will address redshift-distortions, (which affect both the program of mass power spectrum recovery, as well as<br/>the ability to measure the cosmological constant through its geometrical distortion of the<br/>correlation function), degeneracies among parameters (by performing a full likelihood analysis<br/>which will reveal the degeneracies in the 4 to 6 free parameters in the current model of the forest), and obtaining a better understanding of the thermal history of the universe, (by using the drop in temperature with time after reionization to infer or at least limit the epoch of reionization from measurements of the temperature using the small-scale cut-off of the transmission power<br/>spectrum at redshifts between 2 and 4.)<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"
0.372382,"The purpose of this work is to i) develop and validate new, efficient machine learning methods for making inferences and predictions in a massively parallel and distributed way on large-scale complex data sets coming from upcoming sky surveys, and ii) help answer important fundamental questions in cosmology and astrophysics using those new methods. Theoretical properties of these algorithms will also be investigated. The proposed cosmology and astrophysics applications will include a) building a probabilistic model for light intensity signals from stars, b) evolving the matter density of the Universe at a speed much higher than the traditional method of N-body simulations, and c) creating ""mock catalogs"" with all commonly observable galaxy properties. The methods that are developed will have far broader applicability than the examples listed here, both for other problems in astrophysics and problems in completely different domains (e.g. bioinformatics, climatology, social sciences), where complex scientific simulations require large-scale learning methods. The software developed in this work (including documentation, examples, and case studies) will be made publicly available. The PIs will also include the results in their course materials for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The aim of this proposal is to develop new machine learning methods that can work directly on large-scale, high-dimensional functions and continuous distributions as inputs or outputs in a regression problem, and can process large-scale scientific data in a massively parallel distributed way. Important theoretical properties, such as computational efficiency, sample complexity, generalization accuracy, consistency, lower and upper bounds on the convergence rates will also be investigated. Gaussian processes (GPs) are among the most popular nonparametric Bayesian function approximation methods. However, the standard GP methods are limited to at most a few thousands data points, and not applicable for large datasets. Kernel learning for GPs is an even more challenging problem. The question of how to scale up GP kernel learning methods for large datasets will be addressed as part of this project. Using the machine learning methods developed in this proposal, the following cosmology and astrophysics problems will be investigated: a) Scalable Gaussian processes with spectral mixture kernels will be used to build a probabilistic generative model for light intensity signals from stars to extract fundamental properties such as density profiles. b) New machine learning algorithms will be used to evolve the matter density of the Universe at a speed much higher than the traditional method of N-body simulations. This will enable a completely new way of generating a large number of cosmological simulations in order to compare the cosmological observations to our understanding of the Universe. c) Simulated galaxy catalogs are a powerful tool for testing cosmological analysis methods, since the cosmological parameters in the simulation are known and thus our ability to recover them can be tested perfectly. For a single cosmological simulation, the properties and alignments of galaxies are not fully determined, but rather must be added probabilistically to the dark matter distribution as an extra layer of modeling typically with many parameters. The new machine learning tools developed in this proposal will be used to make ""mock catalogs"" with all commonly observable galaxy properties."

The goal of this project is twofold: to extend our understanding of the origin and fate of the universe, and to use the last generation of cosmological observations to test recent developments in quantum-gravity. Additionally, this award supports several educational initiatives that enhance the teaching of cosmology at graduate and undergraduate levels through the creation of new courses as well as outreach projects in coordination with the LIGO Science Education Center.<br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at developing theoretical methods to incorporate quantum gravity physics in models of the early universe. Investigations will focus on theoretical as well as phenomenological aspects of quantum cosmology, with special emphasis on techniques coming from loop quantum gravity. From the theoretical point of view, it will be explored how matter fields propagate on regimes where quantum aspects of gravity are important, and the way in which the familiar quantum field theory in curved space-times emerges from the more fundamental theory. From the phenomenological viewpoint, the resulting theoretical framework will be applied to extend cosmological models to include Planck scale physics. Investigations will cover scalar perturbations that are responsible for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy distribution, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, and gravitational waves generated in the early universe. Attention will also be paid to find mechanisms to account for some anomalies recently observed in cosmic microwave background. The results of this project are expected to reinforce the bridge between quantum gravity and cosmology, producing benefits for both fields."
0.042985,"It is known that Einstein's General Relativity (GR) is theory to describe the gravitational physics. The theory of GR has helped us to make many tremendous progresses in understanding the fundamental aspect of space and time. The theory has been successful in describing the physics of universe, as well as making predictions for various astrophysical phenomena. However it is also well-known that the theory of GR is incomplete. It loses its capability of making predictions in the extremely strong gravitational field, e.g. inside a black hole, or at the very early stage of universe near the big bang. One of the most fundamental open questions in physics is how to complete GR in order to predict physics in an extremely strong gravitational field. The complete theory of gravity that we are searching for is called ""Quantum Gravity"". The theory of Quantum Gravity should play a crucial role in describing the physics inside black hole, and helping us to understand the early universe near the big bang. Eventually Quantum Gravity will lead us to a revolutionary understanding of space and time. The PI's group will also train students in STEM areas of research.<br/><br/>This award support the development of a the theory of known as ""Loop Quantum Gravity"" (LQG). LQG is an approach toward Quantum Gravity featured with the background independence and non-perturbative quantization of spacetime structure. In developing the theory of LQG, the PI presented a promising new formulation of LQG with a cosmological constant. The new formulation defines finite spinfoam amplitudes of LQG. It also relates LQG to many other branches of physics and mathematics, in particular, it points out a concrete relation between LQG and String/M-Theory. The new formulation of LQG with a cosmological constant is going to be fully explored in this project, hopefully making progress towards some open issues in cosmology. The proposed work aims at (1) completing both the non-perturbative and perturbative formulation of the new model; (2) obtaining new insights and tools for LQG by exploring the relation to String/M-Theory and AdS/CFT; (3) extracting phenomenological predictions on the physics of cosmological constant. This project is expected to be an important step toward a complete formulation of LQG that could be empirically tested."
0.18,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Daniel Boyanovsky at the Department of Physics, University of Pittsburgh. <br/><br/>Our understanding of the early and present Universe has been revolutionized by observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background and galaxies, supporting the main paradigm of inflationary cosmology: quantum-mechanical fluctuations of primordial origin seed the formation of galaxies. These observations, along with the discovery of the Higgs Boson and the experimental confirmation of the theory of strong and electroweak interactions, confirm the Standard Models of Cosmology and Particle Physics. Along with these discoveries new challenging aspects emerge: 95% of the energy density in the Universe is in the form of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Furthermore, neutrinos, the most elusive particles in nature, are found to be massive and undergo mixing and oscillations among the different types --- a phenomenon beyond the Standard Model. These discoveries bring an unprecedented convergence of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in which observations of galaxies along with accelerator and reactor experiments will yield insights beyond the Standard Models, with the tantalizing possibility that a new species of neutrinos may explain Dark Matter. Professor Boyanovsky's research program seeks a fundamental understanding on two fronts: (i) the production and properties of a new species of neutrinos as possible Dark-Matter candidates, and (ii) a firmer assessment of the quantum fluctuations generated in the primordial Universe that ultimately seed the formation of galaxies. The program is at the forefront of particle astrophysics and cosmology, complements robust experimental and observational efforts, and is truly interdisciplinary as it implements methods from other fields in physics. Research in these areas thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of the most fundamental and stimulating endeavors of deep intellectual merit: the discovery of novel phenomena and the understanding of the evolution of our Universe and the origin of galaxies beginning from the smallest constituents. Through this cross-fertilization of concepts and methods, this research program also provides students with a broader perspective and unique opportunity to acquire a truly interdisciplinary educational experience. <br/><br/>Specifically, Professor Boyanovsky will study mechanisms for production, evolution, and gravitational clustering of new species of neutrinos during the early stages of the Early Universe by implementing methods from out-of-equilibrium quantum field theory and from quantum kinetics. These powerful methods will allow a systematic assessment of the new species of neutrinos as a Dark-Matter candidate. In cosmology, the program will focus on a deeper understanding of quantum processes and correlations during the inflationary stage in the early Universe. In particular, Professor Boyanovsky will study modifications of the spectrum of fluctuations from interactions and pre- and post-inflationary dynamics and their potential for detection with forthcoming observations. The study of processes during the period of rapid inflationary expansion requires novel tools. New methods based on concepts borrowed from quantum optics, such as quantum master equations, and out-of-equilibrium effective field theory, will provide a deeper and more fundamental assessment of possible observational consequences."

The goal of this research project is to make important progress in providing answers to key open questions at the frontier of of particle physics, cosmology and gravity research, and in doing so to go significantly beyond the current state of the art in the field. The PIs propose individual research programs with elements which will be executed jointly. New particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and envisioned successors are probing new physics at the energy frontier and are capable of providing answers to important questions about the structure and history of the universe. On the other hand, cosmology provides a unique laboratory to study questions in physics inaccessible to traditional particle physics methods, and forms a valuable complement to accelerators. Our current understanding of the fundamental problems about the origin, evolution and future of our universe is still in its infancy, and a synthesis of many independent lines of evidence will be necessary to point the way to explanations. This project reflects that synergy, and promises to make significant progress in connecting high-precision cosmological and accelerator data to fundamental questions such as the origin and evolution of the universe, the unification of gravitation with quantum mechanics, the role of the vacuum in the structure of space and time.

Part of his research will be focused to the LHC physics, in particular on further development of a comprehensive LHC event generator BlackMax which is extensively used by ATLAS and CMS in search for exotic physics, and understanding implications of the recent Higgs discovery on gravity and cosmology (in collaboration with Wackeroth). Part of his research will be dedicated to cosmology, in particular to studying predictions of a recently proposed class of inflationary models (in collaboration with Kinney), as well as studying new puzzling patterns in quasar light curves which seem to be closely related to the quasars' redshifts. The main goal of Kinney's research is to make quantitative connections between new observational data and detailed properties of the early universe to address fundamental questions such as: What is the energy scale of cosmological inflation? What is the form of the leading-order operator in the inflationary potential? Is the inflationary Lagrangian consistent with a simple canonical field theory? Is there evidence for quantum gravity effects, for example a Planck-scale cutoff in quantum modes? Can we explain CMB anomalies, such as the hemispherical asymmetry observed by Planck? Are there viable alternatives to inflation? What properties do they have? Wackeroth will concentrate on the precision electroweak (EW) physics, in particular on corrections to W and Z boson production in hadronic collisions, improving predictions for H,W, Z production in association with heavy quarks, and NLO EW corrections to triple EW gauge boson production with non-standard couplings.

The research will produce elegant and powerful statistics to analyze peculiar velocity samples, virtually the only dynamical probe of cosmology, and will use them to study large scale structure, neutrino mass estimation, and the matter content of the Universe. Velocity fields sample the mass distribution directly and are less susceptible to problems of bias and conventional priors as compared to other probes such as the cosmic microwave background, redshift surveys, or gravitational lensing. This work will allow peculiar velocity surveys to re-emerge as a useful and unique tool to investigate the large-scale mass distribution on various cosmological scales. The statistical, analytical and numerical methods developed in this project will be valuable for probing cosmological data sets to gather information about fundamental processes.<br/><br/>In addition, these statistical tools will help to extract relevant information in many areas of research whenever the data are noisy and unwieldy. The PI is deeply involved in the important work of outreach and the introduction of scientific innovation to the public, travelling widely to lecture to diverse groups, from elementary to high school students, to churches, special interest groups and professional societies.

Among the physics goals is to predict the mass spectrum of the new supersymmetric particles, explore possible new physics just above the electroweak scale, numerically compute Yukawa couplings, explore the implications of these theories for cosmology, and confront these theories with the data from the LHC and cosmological observations.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have considerable broader impacts. Primary among these is the synergy of bringing together representatives of three disciplines (string theory, mathematics, and cosmology) in three different countries to solve some of the most fundamental problems in modern science.

0.12,"Recent developments in cosmology and theoretical physics have generated growing support for the idea that our universe may be just one of many in an ensemble of universes called the Multiverse. Evidence for the Multiverse includes the surprising 1998 discovery that the expansion rate of our universe is accelerating (and the inference that ""dark energy"" is causing the acceleration), and a combination of ideas from the theory of cosmological inflation and string theory. The usual arguments from fundamental physics suggest a colossal mismatch between the predicted and observed values of the dark energy, off by as much as 120 orders of magnitude. Faced with such discrepancies, several leading cosmologists have invoked the ""Anthropic Principle"": if many universes exist (each with different dark energy values) and only a certain range of such values would permit galaxies to form and life to evolve, then it need not be surprising that we find a particular value of dark energy within our own observable universe. However, the Anthropic Principle has long proven controversial both within and outside the scientific community.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>Our project aims to clarify how evidence is used to test cosmological theories that predict the existence of the Multiverse.

Only twenty years ago cosmology was a semi-qualitative, highly theoretical collection of general ideas about the possible past and future of the universe. Today, cosmology is rapidly turning into a precision science, informed by a new generation of large, high quality, cosmological surveys carried out by observatories both in space and on the ground. The current task is to understand data already available, and to prepare the tools for precision analysis of forthcoming data. In this project Dr. Gnedin and his collaborators will develop techniques to model the distribution of galaxies using recent and future large-scale surveys. Current surveys have already compiled catalogs of three-dimensional positions of about 100,000 galaxies, and in the next several years this number will increase ten-fold. To mine these surveys for the cosmological information locked inside them, this project will use state-of-the-art numerical simulations to model the distribution of matter in the Universe. <br/>***"
0.382692,"Clusters of galaxies can be used to constrain cosmological parameters such as the cosmological constant and are an important probe of dark matter and dark energy. However, their use in these roles is limited by their remaining systematic uncertainties in such nonlinear thermal and nonthermal processes, such as cosmic rays and magnetic fields. This project is focused on using advanced adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) N-body computer simulations with physics constrained by multiwavelength observations. The principal investigator used previous NSF funding to develop the framework to support these investigations using the Enzo computer code. In the proposed project, Cloudy, a new radiative cooling computer software module, will be combined with three different models for distributed heating---star particles, massive galaxy constructs, and active galactic nuclei. These additions to the simulations will help provide more realistic modeling of cluster evolution that will improve our general understanding of cluster properties, such as biases in current mass estimation and limitations of using clusters as probes of precision cosmology.<br/><br/>The project builds on previous NSF-funded work on developing code to simulate cluster evolution. The proposed more advanced simulations will lay important and timely groundwork for interpreting upcoming Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect, weak lensing, radio, and X-ray surveys. The proposed work will do an excellent job of closely matching simulations with observations in the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray portions of the spectrum. This work is at the forefront of such investigations.<br/><br/>The principal investigator offers several ways to extend the impact of this project. Educationally, (1) a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student will participate and be mentored in the project, and (2) modules will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework to teach such physical principles as large scale structure formation and turbulence in the Universe. For public outreach, cosmological simulations will be incorporated into public planetarium programs locally and freely distributed nationally to other planetariums. Finally, the principal investigator will make the developed software modules publicly available to the benefit of the entire scientific community."
0.12112,"***<br/>9800103<br/>Berger<br/>The spatially homogeneous, isotropic Standard Cosmological Model appears to describe our Universe reasonably well. However, Einstein's equations allow a much larger class of cosmological solutions. Theorems originally due to Penrose and Hawking predict that all such models (assuming reasonable matter properties) will have an initial singularity. The nature of this singularity in generic cosmologies remains a major open question in general relativity. Spatially homogeneous but possibly anisotropic cosmologies have two types of singularities: (1) velocity dominated--(reversing the time direction) the universe evolves to the singularity with fixed anisotropic collapse rates; (2) Mixmaster--the anisotropic collapse rates change in a deterministically chaotic way. Much less is known about spatially inhomogeneous universes.<br/><br/>Belinskii, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz (BKL) claimed long ago that a generic universe would evolve toward the singularity as a different Mixmaster universe at each spatial point.

The topics cover applications of holographic duality to outstanding problems in cosmology and gravitation. The topics include: Brane world cosmologies and String Theory models of inflation, resolution of Cosmological Singularities, analog models of cosmology and gravity and their gauge theory duals, thermalization and black hole formation and causal structure of space-time. The foreign collaborator<br/>is Dr. Adel Awad at Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The two investigators are currently carrying out research funded by the NSF/Physics Division for interdisciplinary work at the border between traditional theoretical high-energy physics and condensed-matter physics. That work is considered to be potentially transformative. They are working on a new topic called the AdS/CFT correspondence. This is a theoretical tool which has developed over the past decade which enables physicists to study theories in new mathematical limits that have been literally beyond the reach of earlier analysis techniques. The two physicists are pioneers in using these techniques in order to build new connections between different subfields of physics, and their recent work has taken them in the direction of connecting string theory and gravity.

0.057555,"ABSTRACT <br/>AST 0098506<br/>Zaldarriaga<br/><br/>This is a Collaborative Research Project with Lam Hui (0098437) of Columbia University.<br/><br/>The light from a quasar (also called a qso) often has multiple dips in intensity, or absorption lines, at positions corresponding to the redshifted Lyman alpha line (at rest wavelength 1216 angstroms) from neutral hydrogen. These often occur as a series of absorption lines, called the Lyman alpha forest. The redshift is caused by the expansion of the universe. If we can calculate<br/>how the universe is expanding (based on a cosmological model), we can tell where the photons were absorbed in relation to us. Thus, we can use the absorption map to plot the positions of<br/>clouds of intervening hydrogen between the quasar and us. The clouds in the Lyman alpha systems are not very massive compared to objects like galaxies. Because of this, reliable computer simulations (numerical experiments) of their gravitational collapse (formation) from primordial fluctuations are possible. These Lyman alpha forest simulations produce structure similar to what we see in the nearby universe (filaments, walls, and voids ) by starting with small fluctuations in matter density and then letting gravity and other known forces act. These detailed calculations of the structure and distribution of matter are at the frontiers of current research and <br/>these recent advances in computer modeling have made it possible to use observations of the Lyman-alpha forest at redshifts between 2 and 4 as powerful cosmological tools. <br/><br/>The forest has offered, and will continue to offer, interesting constraints on many quantities such as the amplitude and shape of the primordial mass power spectrum, the neutrino mass, the matter density, the cosmological constant, and the reionization epoch. These constraints, in conjunction with those from other observations, provide important checks on our fundamental understanding of cosmology.<br/><br/>This project will primarily focus on the ""transmission power spectrum"", a statistic used in cosmological models which is directly observable. The program has two goals:<br/>1) Examination of fundamental assumptions: The project will test several methods to address questions about the influence of continuum-fitting in determining the measured fluctuations in the forest , the interpretation of these fluctuations in terms of mass fluctuations resulting from gravitational instability, and the effect of fluctuations in the ionizing background and the effective equation of state of the intergalactic medium on the interpretation.<br/> 2) Maximizing the scientific return from the data: To this end the program will address redshift-distortions, (which affect both the program of mass power spectrum recovery, as well as<br/>the ability to measure the cosmological constant through its geometrical distortion of the<br/>correlation function), degeneracies among parameters (by performing a full likelihood analysis<br/>which will reveal the degeneracies in the 4 to 6 free parameters in the current model of the forest), and obtaining a better understanding of the thermal history of the universe, (by using the drop in temperature with time after reionization to infer or at least limit the epoch of reionization from measurements of the temperature using the small-scale cut-off of the transmission power<br/>spectrum at redshifts between 2 and 4.)<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"

Such measurements were regarded a top scientific priority in the 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics.<br/><br/>This project will facilitate the creation of high-sensitivity polarization and temperature maps of the CMB and directly test inflationary models of the very early, energetic Universe. Cosmological inflation would produce a gravitational-wave background at a level that directly corresponds with the vacuum energy density at the end of inflation. By looking for the odd-parity signature of a gravitational-wave background in the CMB polarization, the so-called ""B modes,"" CLASS will investigate physics on grand-unification-theory (GUT) energy scales of 10^16 GeV. In contrast, the Large Hadron Collider is designed to probe energies up to 7x10^3 GeV.

0.267,"Dr. Jeffrey M. Silverman is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Texas at Austin (UT). The fellow's research project centers on improving an important tool for measuring precise cosmological parameters: Type Ia supernovae. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars, and because such features as their peak brightness and the rate at which they fade away are reliably predicable, they are used to measure distances to other galaxies. As a result, these supernovae help astrophysicists to measure cosmological parameters and to determine the expansion history of the Universe. Their use ultimately led to the discovery of the accelerating Universe, for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 2011. The fellow will apply new distance measurement methods that utilize spectral observations in addition to photometric data in order to refine their use.<br/><br/>Despite their cosmological utility, astrophysicists still do not fully understand the process by which the exploding white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar limit, whether it actually reaches the limit (or significantly exceeds it in some cases), what progenitor scenarios and environments lead to SNe Ia, or the details of how the explosion itself occurs. To help resolve these and other issues, Dr. Silverman will explore the population of SN Ia host galaxies as well as undertake detailed studies of both ""normal"" and ""peculiar"" nearby, bright SNe Ia. Data for these in-depth investigations will be obtained at the very earliest times (i.e., hours after explosion) to 1--2 years past maximum brightness. These data will allow analyses of SNe Ia, their progenitor systems, and their explosion physics. Through this work Dr. Silverman aims to build up a more detailed picture of SNe Ia.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component. The fellow will undertake a program of educational outreach in partnership with the McDonald Observatory to create new content for their multi-day summer Teacher Professional Development Workshops. He will base the new materials for the workshops around topics that are closely tied to his areas of expertise, such as supernovae, stellar evolution, and cosmology. Dr. Silverman will also develop new ""Live From McDonald Observatory"" video-conference programs for students throughout the state of Texas with associated hands-on activities. This material will be field-tested and refined with the help of local teachers and will be presented to teachers and science educators from around the state at the annual Conference for the Advancement of Science Teaching. This education program will directly impact hundreds of teachers and thousands of students in Texas, most of whom come from underrepresented populations and economically disadvantaged backgrounds."

Questions such as ""What is the Universe made of?"" "" What are matter, energy, space and time?"" , which have now come to the forefront of research in experimental particle physics, observational cosmology and astrophysics, are tied together by remarkable developments on the theoretical front: An effective synthesis of previously disconnected areas of general relativity and cosmology, quantum gravity, quantum field theory, string theory and even pure mathematics.<br/><br/>The purpose of the group's proposed activity is to perform fundamental theoretical research at the crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string theory, with applications ranging from physics beyond the standard model, to the multiverse approach in cosmology, the interface of string theory and condensed matter, and the nature of space and time in quantum gravity. The PIs believe that their group is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the diversity in their expertise, tied together by the overlap in interests and focus on the same fundamental questions about the Universe.<br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs propose to take the following approach. Mina Aganagic is one of the leading experts in topological string theory. Her work will focus on applications of topological string methods and string dualities to novel mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking and in string phenomenology. She will further pursue the study of black hole entropy from the perspective of topological strings. Raphael Bousso has done seminal work on holography and geometric entropy bounds, co-discovered the landscape of string-theory vacua, and proposed a solution to the cosmological constant problem. He will work on challenges we face in extracting predictions from the landscape and the eternally inflating multiverse, such as the measure problem in eternal inflation, and replacing anthropic conditions by more general selection criteria. Petr Horava participated in a number of turning-point discoveries in string theory, such as orientifolds, D-branes, and M-theory. He will apply methods of nonequilibrium field theory to quantum gravity and string theory, study quantum gravity with anisotropic scaling, further develop the interface with condensed matter physics, and look for novel phenomena in low-dimensional models of string and M-theory. Yasunori Nomura has contributed significantly to our understanding of physics beyond the standard model; he pioneered grand unification in higher dimensions and proposed novel TeV scale theories. He will work on theoretical particle physics and cosmology relevant to experiments coming in the next decades, in particular the LHC, with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the quark and lepton masses, and the implications of the multiverse on the TeV scale physics.<br/><br/>The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include training of students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists of the nation as well as the world. Berkely Center for Theoretical Physics promotes diversity to encourage female and minority students and scientists. The fundamental questions addressed in this research are of deep interest to the general public, and the PIs will continue promoting the importance and excitement of fundamental science in the broader context of our society. The PIs will work with QuarkNet teachers to convey the essence of cutting-edge scientific discoveries to high school students, and will continue making themselves available as resources.

0.0462,"This proposal will parallelize and apply a new and innovative method that was developed for the numerical simulation of 3D hydrodynamics and gravitational clustering in cosmology. Our goal is to explain the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure in the universe by simulating the coupled effects of gravity, gas dynamics, and radiative transfer in an expanding cosmological universe. A correct solution must resolve the multi-scale, nonlinear growth of gravitational instability, which leads to anisotropic gravitational collapse, highly supersonic motions, strong shocks, radiative cooling, and many orders of magnitude of density contrast. The method is a merger of our substantially improved version of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Method, called Adaptive SPH, or ASPH, and the well-known Particle-Particle/Particle-Mesh(P DSG1 3M) gravitational N-body method, in a cosmologically expanding, matter-dominated Friedmann universe. The ASPH method revolutionizes the standard SPH method by introducing new algorithms for time-and space-variable, anisotropic smoothing and for shock tracking to eliminate spurious heating due to artificial viscosity away from shocks. The ASPH method has significantly increased the dynamical range that can be achieved by numerical hydrodynamical simulations, and is currently the best method to achieve the resolution required to study the problems mentioned above. This project will develop and apply a new parallel computer version of our existing algorithm, that will significantly reduce the CPU time per calculation. DSG1"

Astronomers' expectation of what will be observed at high redshifts (above 7) by future major facilities is largely based on theoretical and numerical models of the early growth of cosmic structure in a standard Lambda-CDM cosmological framework. The new simulations will span local and global scales using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technology developed specifically for petascale computers. This enables simulations with ten billion particles, a spatial dynamic range of a hundred thousand, and complex baryonic physics including radiative and chemical feedback. As theories are at present poorly constrained by observations, an equally important effort will be a rigorous attempt at uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. The study will thus address forefront questions in cosmology using the most complete physical models running on the most powerful computers, analyzed using best practices. The result will be comprehensive models of early cosmic evolution along with a rigorous assessment of their predictive value.<br/><br/>This work will substantially advance the state-of-the-art in numerical multi-physics cosmological simulations, which can be expected to continue previous successful impacts of code availability, both within and outside of the astrophysics community.

These include: (1) Comparing standard cosmological perturbation approximations with the exact solution recently obtained by the PI and Tsamis; (2) A method to calculate the effect of quantum gravity on inflation; (3) Developing a model in which the observed excess of matter over anti-matter is generated during inflation. (4) Computing what happens to the vacuum polarization induced by charged, massless scalar particles after the end of inflation; (5) Investigating whether a very slightly unstable, alternate theory of gravitation can be constructed which explains the motions of cosmological objects without the need for dark matter. (6) Expressing the vacuum polarization of charged massless scalar particles in terms of the natural geometrical objects during inflation; (7) Developing an improved formalism for computing quantum gravitational effects in a locally de Sitter-cosmology background. <br/><br/>Problem (1) is relevant to the precision measurements of the cosmic microwave anisotropy by the WMAP satellite and the various missions planned for the future. Standard approximation techniques are almost certainly sufficient to compute the primordial spectrum from simple models of inflation but the exact result obtained by the PI and Tsamis may be very useful if an exotic model pertains. A successful outcome for problem (2) would completely change the paradigm of inflationary cosmology, resolving two of its major problems (why was the initial state homogeneous enough to begin inflating? and why is the observed cosmological constant so small?) and transforming it into a predictive theory. A successful outcome for problem (3) would resolve the long-standing conundrum that inflation tends to wipe out the excess of matter over anti-matter. Problem (4) should settle the issue of whether or not inflation provided the small but cosmological scale magnetic fields that served as the seeds of the fields we observe in present-day galaxies and galactic clusters. Problem (5) represents the last realistic hope for explaining cosmological motions using an alternate theory of gravitation rather than dark matter.

0.105,"The primary focus of the proposed research project is to use cosmology as a tool for understanding elements of fundamental physics such as quantum gravity and the nature of the vacuum. At the same time, the proposed project will be firmly connected to new precision cosmological observations, in particular developing techniques for constraining early universe cosmology which will be immediately applicable to future high-precision cosmological measurements. The two major tasks to be undertaken are the phenomenology of inflation and its connection to the exciting new observational data and how non vacuum energy-based mechanisms/schemes could account for the observed acceleration of the expansion rate of the universe. A central element of the proposed research program is to extend and update previous work relating cosmological observations to the physics of the early universe, especially inflation. This will involve analysis of new data sets released during the period covered by the grant, and error forecasting for future experiments. The projects of this proposal include: updating and expanding efforts to constrain inflationary physics using observational results; developing and distributing new numerical codes for searching or characterizing inflation parameter space; investigating further transplanckian <br/>effects; and investigating alternate, non-inflationary early universe models."
0.12,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>The study of the fundamental physics that governs evolution of our universe is one of the most exciting research fields in modern physics. In the last two decades, technological advances have made possible a host of cosmological observations strongly constraining the properties of the universe and making possible the formulation of the Standard Model of cosmology in analogy with the Standard Model of particle physics. At the same time, direct cosmological observations are almost always complemented by data from particle accelerators, earth-based detectors and cosmic ray observatories.<br/>Along these lines, the proposed project will have two aspects. The first aspect is related to fundamental theoretical cosmology and envisions a concerted research effort towards understanding and explaining the puzzle of dark energy. The approach to this problem that will be explored is based on the idea of the late time phase transitions in the universe, where the field responsible for the phase transition carries gauge charges. Such models have a very good chance to be tested in near future collider experiments. <br/>The second aspect of the project will be tightly connected to models with large extra dimensions that can accommodate a TeV-scale gravity. Probably the most interesting and intriguing feature of these models is the possibility of production of mini black holes in future collider experiments. The project envisions building a black hole event generator for the LHC which will play an important role in confirming or excluding this class of models. This event generator (tentatively called BlackMax) will be integrated into the ATLAS Monte Carlo programs Herwig and Pythia.. The broader impact of the proposed activities is that they will lead to an improved understanding of the possible connection between dark energy and the Standard Model. This would further link cosmological observations with fundamental physics. This project will provide an excellent training ground for students at both the undergraduate and graduate level. Developed numerical tools as well as the black hole event generator itself will be made public for the benefit of a wider physics community. Scientific results will presented at national and international conferences and workshops. The PI is also a guest Lecturer at ""Petnica Science Center"" which is a center for gifted high school students."
0.221418,"Smooth invertible transformations, or deformations, are fast becoming important tools in modern data analysis. The nonlinear nature of deformations makes these objects extremely powerful while at the same time making them challenging to estimate and theoretically explore. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The theoretical properties of estimated deformations for generating nonparametric and semiparametric statistical estimates are analyzed through a surprising connection with Stein's method. In addition, the investigator focuses on recent results found in the theory of optimal transport, which has the potential to provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for deformable templates. The computational aspects of estimated deformations will utilize a new Euler-Lagrange characterization of a penalized maximum likelihood estimate, which can significantly relieve the typical computational burden associated with estimation. One consequence will be to make these methods available for widespread use by statistical practitioners in a broad range of problems: nonparametric and semiparametric density estimation, estimating gravitational lensing in cosmology and posterior sampling techniques, to name a few. Another intellectual merit of this proposal are the scientific ramifications of two new proposed deformation estimates of weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): a wavelet/Slepian quadratic estimator and a new Bayesian lensing estimator. Gravitational lensing studies have become one of the most successful tools for probing the nature of dark matter. The precise estimation of lensing is important for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, understanding cosmic structure, constraining cosmological parameters and detecting gravity waves. The investigator proposes to uses wavelets and Slepian multi-tapers to adapt the quadratic estimate to local foreground contaminants and sky cuts, which are ubiquitous features in most modern cosmological surveys. The investigator proposes a new Bayesian estimator which has the potential to dramatically change the way gravitational lensing studies are done and how they are integrated within other astronomical surveys.<br/><br/>Smooth invertible transformations, or deformations, are fast becoming important tools in modern data analysis. They have been used with spectacular success in the field of computational anatomy where time varying vector field flows which generate deformations are used to statistically analyze medical fMRI images and quantify abnormal morphological structure. In cosmology, deformations are used to model gravitational distortions of the cosmic microwave background from dark matter density fluctuations, and have resulted in a deeper understanding of cosmic structure. Even though these important tools are becoming integrated in modern scientific methods, the statistical properties of estimated deformations have been largely unexplored. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The tools resulting from this project will be useful, not only in statistics, but also in other branches of science and technology ranging from genetics to machine learning. In the field of physics, for example, the potential scientific progress resulting from gravitational lensing estimation could a have broad impact on scientific understanding and the future of scientific research. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly important to train graduate and undergraduate students with the tools necessary to successfully navigate interdisciplinary work, and who are prepared for independent research. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal will foster a culture of collaboration that will reach the fundamentals of statistical education and will deepen ties with statistics and other physical sciences. In addition, through the integration of research and education, the proposal will teach both graduate and undergraduate students research skills. The result will be two fold. First, it will train graduate students to become creative independent researchers who can contribute within an academic environment. Second, it will educate undergraduates to navigate a work environment which values creative independent investigation."
0.114754,"This award funds the research of Prof. David Chernoff at Cornell University. Substantial theoretical and observational evidence supports the occurrence of inflation at very early times, a brief interval of extremely rapid expansion of the Universe shortly after birth. The mechanism is a profound problem for cosmology and fundamental physics. String theory, the best-developed tool to explore this epoch, suggests that today our Universe may contain relics of that early, energetic phase. The relics are loops of string stretched from microscopic scales to macroscopic scales by the rapid expansion. The proposed research investigates the physics of string loops and possibilities for detecting them. Astronomical detection would be a revolutionary development for string theory and cosmology. Such a discovery would provide a direct glimpse of otherwise inaccessible elements of the underlying physical theory. It would help elucidate the mechanism for inflation while extending our study of the universe to the earliest moments of the big bang itself.<br/><br/>At the very beginning, the universe is believed to have grown exponentially in size via the mechanism of inflation. The almost scale-invariant density perturbation spectrum predicted by inflation is strongly supported by recent observational data. Subsequent evolution, the traditional purview of big bang cosmology, can be accurately modeled with tried-and-true physics. However, the precise inflationary mechanism remains a profound problem for cosmology and for fundamental physics. Intellectual Merit: String theory, the best-developed tool to explore this epoch, suggests the inevitable birth and survival of one-dimensional structures of cosmological sizes, namely, cosmic superstrings. Long, horizon-crossing strings fragment to give loops which fall into growing matter perturbations. The local density of these fossil remnant loops within the galaxy is enhanced over the universe's mean density of loops by many orders of magnitude and numerous loops exist within the galaxy. The PI will investigate how these relics can be sought by optical lensing of background stars and studied in detail through gravitational wave emission. These objects will provide some of the best experimental means to learn about string theory and the birth of our universe. Broader Impacts: As part of this proposal (1) The PI will help train postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates in theoretical physics and cosmology. (2) The PI is committed to publicizing the big questions of theoretical physics and cosmology that motivate the work. The PI will speak in local science museums and help bring the research to life for general audiences."
0.03,"PHY 0506002 <br/>PI: Daniel Chung <br/>Institution: University of Wisconsin <br/>Title: Interface of High Energy Theory and Cosmology <br/><br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes research at the interface of high energy theory, astrophysics, and cosmology. Recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have corroborated the basic picture of inflationary cosmology, which gives an approximate prediction of a spatially flat universe with scale invariant density perturbations on the largest length scales. If the inflationary paradigm is correct, the CMB provides a handle onto the earliest history of the universe. The PI plans to investigate the nonadiabatic interplay between curvature and isocurvature perturbations arising from particle production during inflation, derive signatures of superheavy dark matter (and other nonthermal scenarios), and search for novel consistency conditions for inflationary scenarios. These investigations will not only provide new ways to interpret existing and future CMB and structure formation data, they will allow constraints on conjectures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Another set of proposed research activities focus on understanding the cosmological implications of the anticipated discovery of Higgs and other new TeV scale physics at the LHC. In this context, one important handle for cosmology is the potential generation of the baryon asymmetry at the electroweak phase transition. Because electroweak baryogenesis is a complicated phenomenon, a prediction of the baryon asymmetry accurate to an order of magnitude still requires refinements. The final set of proposed research actvities are centered on the idea of alternate theories of gravity, which have a multitude of implications for cosmology. One avenue for further exploration is in the context of extra dimensions, and the other is in the context of modifications of fourdimensional Einstein-Hilbert action (particularly in the infrared). The PI plans to explore quantum as well as classical field theoretic aspects of the fields coupled to the alternate gravity."
0.211,"Research will be carried out in cosmology and theoretical elementary particle physics. The main theme of this research will concern the nature and distribution of the dark matter that makes up most of the mass of the universe. This will be explored in a variety of contexts, ranging from implications of particle physics theories of the origin of the universe to studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies and large scale structure in the Universe. An emphasis will be placed on developing predictions that can be tested by comparison with the rapidly increasing data. The ultimate goal of all this work is to contribute toward the creation of a fundamental theory of the origin, evolution, and matter content of the universe. Along the way, improved methods will be developed for working out the predictions of cosmological models and comparing them to observations, including state- of-the-art supercomputer simulation and visualization techniques. These techniques will be used for education and outreach as well, and will be made widely available so that other theorists and observers can use them."

Using very high resolution simulations and other methods, the project will investigate all the issues that have been raised concerning the hypothesis that cold dark matter (CDM) makes up most of the dark matter in the halos of galaxies. If any of these issues actually turn out to be serious problems, it may mean that the main component of dark matter in galaxy halos and on larger scales is not CDM, and it may give us clues regarding the properties of the dark matter. The project will also study the implications of the simulations and data for dark matter detection via the detection of the mutual annihilation of particles that make up the dark matter. The research will also study the constraints on cosmological parameters, including neutrino mass, from cosmological structure formation, in particular the formation of far away galaxies. This work is very important, since it will clarify the nature of most of the matter in the universe."

0.589759,"AST-0349213 Caldwell<br/><br/>Dr. Robert Caldwell, at Dartmouth College, will undertake a program to investigate the physics of the Universe. He will focus on the problem of dark energy, the dominant form of energy in the cosmos, which is responsible for the cosmic acceleration and has transformed our picture of the Universe. Discovery of the physical nature of dark energy would have a basic impact on many branches of physics. Combining cosmology, fields and gravitation, the PI will carry out analytic calculations and numerical computations to investigate: constraints and clues to the basic properties of the dark energy; fundamental physics models of the dark energy, such as quintessence; and the behavior of quintessence in rapidly varying gravitational fields and near black holes. These investigations are well timed to coordinate with the many current and planned experimental and observational programs poised to reveal the nature of the dark energy.<br/><br/>The PI will build upon his commitment to education through a program of student mentoring and curriculum development at Dartmouth. To advance scientific literacy in the wider community, public lectures and outreach activities with local schools, through a partnership with a local science museum, will be undertaken.

0.055276,"This project in computational cosmology deals with studies of inhomogeneous cosmological space-times in regions where the standard linear theory of cosmological perturbations has its limitations, namely super-horizon scales or highly non- linear collapse of matter structures. Prof. Laguna's approach will utilize high performance computing to solve the full non-linear set of Einstein's equations governing cosmological dynamics. This will be followed up with investigations of the propagation of light in clumpy universes. Here, the emphasis will be on two topics: weak gravitational lensing and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. This research is timely and complementary to previous research in this area that makes little use of the full details of modern gravitation theory. CMB polarization experiments are now being undertaken by several different groups, and it will be important to understand the implications of their results."

0.00858,"Historians and philosophers of science have studied the development and evaluation of theories in a wide variety of fields, and have developed a number of different approaches to these topics. What little attention has been devoted to modern cosmology has focused almost entirely on the controversy between the big bang theory and the steady state theory, a controversy which ended in the mid-60s. Since then a great deal of theoretical effort has been devoted to understanding the very early universe. This dissertation research project intends to develop a content-rich history of this research, with a focus on issues of theory development and evaluation. The NSF dissertation research support will allow the researcher to interview several prominent cosmologists and visit archives with collections related to modern cosmology (England, Chicago, Boston, and Princeton). These interviews and archival visits will allow the researcher to develop a more nuanced and insightful historical account of this period and to pose methodological questions to working scientists. In addition, detailed interviews with cosmologists will be a valuable resource for future historians. The research and interviews will focus on two methodological questions. Much of early universe research has been motivated by the alluring idea that fundamental physics dictates large scale properties of the universe. In particular, inflationary cosmology has won widespread acceptance due to its ability to solve a number of ""fine-tuning"" problems of standard cosmology. However, cosmologists' assessments of the importance of this success differ widely. Via focused interviews with proponents and critics of inflation (and earlier theories with a similar motivation), the researcher will explore the reasons for these differing assessments. The interviews will also focus on attempts to make precision tests of inflation."
0.174453,"High-resolution and high-sensitivity microwave sky surveys are just beginning, from experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT). They will detect thousands of galaxy clusters through the spectral distortion of the microwave background radiation known as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE). These experiments have the remarkable potential to measure galaxy cluster velocities using a small signal known as the kinetic SZE (kSZ), which would be the first direct determination of velocities for objects at cosmological distances. The cosmic velocity field is a powerful probe of structure growth, since velocities are the direct result of gravitational instability. Early studies were generally inconclusive because of large systematic errors. This project is a comprehensive theoretical, phenomenological, and observational study of galaxy cluster velocities, including (1) characterization of the cosmological information; (2) statistical methods for extracting it; (3) calculating the impact of systematic errors; (4) improved calculations of model predictions for the cluster velocity and momentum statistics; (5) studying the accuracy with which cluster velocities and momenta may be extracted from observations in different wave bands; and (6) cluster peculiar velocities and momenta from the ACT experiment. This newly accessible source of cosmological information is a novel probe of the formation of structure in the Universe, providing independent tests of the standard model in cosmology and better determining several fundamental parameters.<br/><br/>The project includes educational initiatives at a range of levels, including mentoring of a graduate student; involving undergraduates in the research effort; and secondary education and public outreach efforts in cooperation with the Allegheny Observatory."
17.449975,"OPP-0638937<br/>Carlstrom<br/><br/>This is a program of research activities broadly directed toward using the new ten-meter South Pole Telescope (SPT) to probe the nature of dark energy and inflation. The telescope and the initial detector array were constructed under a prior award, and science observations are starting during the austral winter 2007. This study includes support for operation of the SPT, storage and reduction of the data, and science analysis. The initial project is a four-thousand square degree survey, using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) to detect all galaxy clusters more massive than a specific limiting value, independent of their redshift. Combining these results with optical redshifts, both currently available and yet to be observed, will place tight constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy. SPT observations will also measure fine-scale temperature anisotropies, which can determine whether a departure from exact scale invariance exists, as is predicted by the current 'standard' inflationary cosmology.<br/><br/>Longer-term projects include developing a new one-thousand-pixel, dual-polarization, multi-band polarimeter for the SPT, to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization anisotropy over scales of an arc-minute to several degrees. Measuring the angular power spectrum of the so-called B-mode polarization, as well as the large angular scale modes imprinted on the CMB by inflationary gravitational waves generated in the first instants of the Universe, exploits the unique and powerful capabilities of the SPT for research at the cutting edge of cosmology and astrophysics. The critical questions, and recommendations for research programs to help answer them, have been the focus of several national reports, including the 2000 NRC Decadal Report on Astronomy and Astrophysics, the NRC report Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos, the OSTP inter-agency report Physics of the Universe, and the reports of the Task Force on CMB Research and the Dark Energy Task Force. The science of the SPT research projects is at the heart of cosmology, is directed at answering some of these most compelling questions, and will have significant broader impacts throughout cosmology and physics.<br/><br/>More broadly, the project contributes to the training of the next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with technology and instrumentation development, astronomical observations, and scientific analysis. The SPT surveys will also lead to large, publicly available datasets. The sharing of forefront research with non-scientists extends beyond the university to both established and new programs based on exploiting the growing popularity of video and audio content on the web.

0.136143,"ABSTRACT <br/>AST 0098437<br/>Hui<br/><br/>This is a Collaborative Research Project with Matias Zaldarriaga (0098506) of New York University.<br/><br/>The light from a quasar (also called a qso) often has multiple dips in intensity, or absorption lines, at positions corresponding to the redshifted Lyman alpha line (at rest wavelength 1216 angstroms) from neutral hydrogen. These often occur as a series of absorption lines, called the Lyman alpha forest. The redshift is caused by the expansion of the universe. If we can calculate<br/>how the universe is expanding (based on a cosmological model), we can tell where the photons were absorbed in relation to us. Thus, we can use the absorption map to plot the positions of<br/>clouds of intervening hydrogen between the quasar and us. The clouds in the Lyman alpha systems are not very massive compared to objects like galaxies. Because of this, reliable computer simulations (numerical experiments) of their gravitational collapse (formation) from primordial fluctuations are possible. These Lyman alpha forest simulations produce structure similar to what we see in the nearby universe (filaments, walls, and voids ) by starting with small fluctuations in matter density and then letting gravity and other known forces act. These detailed calculations of the structure and distribution of matter are at the frontiers of current research and <br/>these recent advances in computer modeling have made it possible to use observations of the Lyman-alpha forest at redshifts between 2 and 4 as powerful cosmological tools. <br/><br/>The forest has offered, and will continue to offer, interesting constraints on many quantities such as the amplitude and shape of the primordial mass power spectrum, the neutrino mass, the matter density, the cosmological constant, and the reionization epoch. These constraints, in conjunction with those from other observations, provide important checks on our fundamental understanding of cosmology.<br/><br/>This project will primarily focus on the ""transmission power spectrum"", a statistic used in cosmological models which is directly observable. The program has two goals:<br/>1) Examination of fundamental assumptions: The project will test several methods to address questions about the influence of continuum-fitting in determining the measured fluctuations in the forest , the interpretation of these fluctuations in terms of mass fluctuations resulting from gravitational instability, and the effect of fluctuations in the ionizing background and the effective equation of state of the intergalactic medium on the interpretation.<br/> 2) Maximizing the scientific return from the data: To this end the program will address redshift-distortions, (which affect both the program of mass power spectrum recovery, as well as<br/>the ability to measure the cosmological constant through its geometrical distortion of the<br/>correlation function), degeneracies among parameters (by performing a full likelihood analysis<br/>which will reveal the degeneracies in the 4 to 6 free parameters in the current model of the forest), and obtaining a better understanding of the thermal history of the universe, (by using the drop in temperature with time after reionization to infer or at least limit the epoch of reionization from measurements of the temperature using the small-scale cut-off of the transmission power<br/>spectrum at redshifts between 2 and 4.)<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"

0.289936,"The ""Feedback in Realistic Environments"" (FIRE) project introduces exciting new ways to account for the effects of the earliest generation of stars, formed when the Universe is young, on the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, the large-scale tracers of cosmology, the science of the origin and evolution of the Universe. The FIRE computer models will include more of the important physics than has ever been done before, and early tests suggest this work agrees with observations more cleanly than previous studies, which had to include various arbitrary assumptions in order to make progress. The technical details within FIRE will also disentangle problems due to the uncertain physics of galaxy formation from problems caused solely by the limitations of computer modeling.<br/><br/>FIRE will carry out novel computational studies of galaxy formation using high-resolution cosmological simulations that resolve the interstellar medium (ISM) with unprecedented realism. Star formation injects large quantities of energy and momentum into the surrounding medium, and this stellar feedback generates galactic winds that affect the galactic environment. This project will run the first cosmological simulations that self-consistently include important stellar feedback physics. Combining a resolved, multiphase ISM with highly non-linear feedback interactions produces powerful galactic winds in broad agreement with observations, without using any of the ad hoc prescriptions which previous simulations have had to invoke. FIRE simulations will address the regulation of galaxy growth by stellar feedback, the properties of galactic inflows and outflows, the morphological transformation of galaxies, quenching of star formation in massive galaxies, active galactic nucleus feedback, the escape fraction of ionizing photons, and stellar feedback on dark matter halos. All of these simulations will be connected directly with multi-wavelength observations. In particular, simulated absorption line statistics compared with high-redshift measurements will test predictions of gas flows in and out of galaxies. Technical enhancements incorporated into FIRE will help to quantify the relative importance of numerical and physical uncertainties in galaxy formation modeling. The initial conditions of all FIRE simulations will be made available to the community to motivate others to follow this approach.<br/><br/>The project includes training of four graduate students, who will also learn from the collaborative interactions across three institutions. Visualizations from FIRE form a basis for outreach targeted at high school students, including workshops in computational thinking for teachers. Other efforts include seminars aimed at teachers, local astronomy enthusiasts, and students from underrepresented groups, working to explain the connection between local phenomena on Earth and the cosmic processes studied by FIRE."

The void environment, in which gas-stripping galaxy interactions are extremely rare, is therefore a crucial test of our understanding of the processes affecting galaxy formation. The exact degree of mismatch between predicted halos and observed galaxies will be quantified, the detailed star formation and gas properties of void dwarfs will be measured, and comparison will be made to high-resolution cosmological simulations."

0.27,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vilenkin at Tufts University.<br/><br/>The theory of cosmic inflation, which was proposed as a speculative hypothesis 35 years ago, has by now accumulated substantial observational support and has become the leading cosmological paradigm. This theory has also led to a major change in our global view of the universe. According to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a ""bubble"" where inflation has ended, but it will never end in the entire universe. The total volume of inflating regions continues to grow, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. The major goal of the proposed research is to learn how this ""multiverse"" scenario can be tested observationally and to investigate its implications for the beginning of the universe. The multiverse worldview has far-reaching implications beyond physics. It provides a dramatically new perspective on the global structure of the universe and on our place in it. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the understanding of the properties of the universe. Professor Vilenkin will also involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He will continue his efforts to communicate the ideas of modern cosmology to the general public, in the form of public lectures, popular articles, and interviews for radio and TV. He will also write a textbook, emphasizing the new worldview, based on his undergraduate cosmology course, which is aimed at students with no preparation in science.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Vilenkin will investigate the possibility of a direct test of the multiverse scenario by observing collisions of our bubble with other bubbles, or with topological defects that could nucleate in the inflating background. Possible observational effects of such collisions will be studied using both analytic and numerical methods. A complementary approach is to analyze the statistical properties of the multiverse and use them to derive predictions for the observed values of the constants of Nature in our bubble. This approach will be pursued, with the main focus on the statistics of different states in the multiverse and of the transition rates between them. The general problem of making predictions in the multiverse, known as the measure problem, will also be addressed."

""Dark energy"" is the term for the unknown form of energy that is accelerating the expansion of the Universe. By improving constraints on key cosmological parameters, the proposed research would significantly improve our understanding of the Universe. For the education component of her work, Liu will serve as a volunteer instructor for Princeton's Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI), where she will teach college level mathematics and science courses, including a new preparatory physics and astronomy course aimed at helping inmates discover their interest in science and acquire the skills and credentials to succeed in life outside prison. <br/><br/>Liu will undertake N-body ray-tracing simulations to investigate non-Gaussian statistics that are essential for a proper interpretation of the weak lensing of galaxies and the cosmic microwave background.

It will also advance our understanding of weak lensing systematics, including photometric redshift, intrinsic alignment of galaxies, and shape measurements. Reducing noise from these systematics will further improve cosmological constraints.

0.21,"This award funds part of the research activity of Professor Savvas Koushiappas at Brown University. The main goal of this award is to unite theoretical studies of the physics of dark matter with current and future experimental efforts. The experimentally motivated theoretical projects use observations of high energy photons and other energetic particles such as positrons and neutrinos (into which dark matter might decay or annihilate) in order to tackle fundamental questions about the nature of dark matter, the origin of astrophysical backgrounds, the astrophysical effects of cosmology and most importantly the interplay and connections among these different topics. The primary goal is the interpretation of dark matter indirect detection search data in the context of dark matter properties and the implications for accelerator studies. A secondary goal is the understanding and improvement of systematic uncertainties that arise from astrophysical processes and the cosmological context. The outcome of this work will help understand the confidence at which theoretical dark matter interpretations can be ruled out from null searches, and to establish the confidence to which dark matter's physical properties can be measured in future experimental efforts.<br/><br/>Any dark matter experimental technique is ultimately linked to the details of the interplay between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. For example direct detection experiments depend on the local density and velocity distribution of dark matter, indirect detection experiments depend on the square of the dark matter density along a line of sight, and each of these techniques depends on the cross section of interactions and the mass of the dark matter particle, both of which are probed in accelerator searches. It is therefore imperative that theoretical interpretations of experimental results in the context of particle physics must take into account this amalgamation of information. This research will bridge the gap between these disciplines, making the connection between astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics possible by understanding the uncertainties and connections between different disciplines. These goals will be achieved by sophisticated theoretical modeling, and new and existing statistical and analysis tools. In addition, the broader impact pertains to the synergy between indirect detection, direct detection and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) searches, thus connecting the laboratory to the sky, a necessary link that must be in place for any convincing dark matter interpretation of any signal. Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate education at the PI's institution will benefit from the exposure to cosmology, particle physics and computing, as well as the development and implementation of new computational and analysis tools. And finally, the proposed outreach activities of the PI will allow the public and students within Providence to engage in science-related activities."

The technique to be used in this research is completely independent of the other techniques in use. It will be based on a series of computer simulations, each using a different mass density, of the observed spatial distribution of galaxies. The results of these simulations will then be compared with the true galaxy distributions as measured in new, large-scale surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. This new technique should provide a good, independent check on our current knowledge of the universe and its evolution.<br/><br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic<br/>Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"

0.06259,"Theoretical research at the interface of elementary particle physics and cosmology will focus on how physical processes that took place early in the evolution of the Universe can help us understand both the fundamental structure of matter and its interactions, and the large-scale structure of the Universe. The methods to be used consist of analytical tools from theoretical particle physics and large-scale computer simulations of non-linear field theories, designed to model the dynamics of phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking in an expanding Universe. Applications to the construction of models of particle interactions and to the impact of phase transitions on cosmology will be analyzed in detail. It is expected that the results obtained by this research activity will help clarify many of the complex issues that arise when one examines some of the fundamental problems of particle physics and cosmology, such as the excess of matter over antimatter in the Universe, as well as the origin of its rich large-scale structure."

A second investigation will be of the angular anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation in open cosmological models.

0.376636,"The search for a quantum theory of gravity has seen progress with the advent of string theory and loop quantum gravity, but both lack direct contact with experiment. The PI proposes a five-year plan that can potentially resolve fundamental problems in cosmology and particle physics by developing new models that arise from theories beyond the standard model and quantum gravity. Additionally, he proposes new observational schemes to test these models. The PI's long-term research plans over the next five years focus on two themes. One is at the Interface of Particle Physics and Cosmology where he hopes to look at the consequences for LHC physics of his new model that unifies gravity with the electroweak force. He will also investigate the phenomenological consequences of a Supersymmetric extension of this model. The second area concerns the nature of the cosmological singularity. The PI has proposed several novel theories based on modifying gravity and will also consider the experimental consequences of these models. The outreach part of this Career program will consist of <br/>the PI giving a two-week course on Music and the Cosmos, which will be hands on presentation on the physics of sound and musical instruments. These lectures will be presented to urban high school students through the Upward Bound Summer Science program at Penn State. The PI will also serve as both a research and long-term career mentor for two minority undergraduate students each year, by creating two summer research positions in his group through this award."
0.15,"Quantum gravity is the theory that arises from combining gravity with relativity (how observers compare time and distance) and quantum mechanics (the key principle of which is that every degree of freedom has a tiny amount of motion). It has long been the subject of wild speculation, unchecked by the usual chain of observation and experiment which characterizes hard science. Recent advances in observational and theoretical cosmology have changed this by providing the first quantum gravitational data ever taken, with a vast potential for increase. The very early universe was expanding so rapidly and with such a high degree of acceleration that the usually tiny fluctuations of gravitational fields in empty space were amplified to a still-small but measurable amount. Equally important, these fluctuations were stretched out in space so far that they became effectively fossilized, and were thereby able to survive down to the current epoch. This project will study how these fluctuations affect gravity itself, and also the other forces and particles. Such studies are part of the great transformation of quantum gravity from science fiction to science fact, and the phenomenon they reveal may help us to better understand the current universe.<br/><br/>Interactions which involve undifferentiated gravitons and/or massless, minimally coupled scalars can give rise to greatly enhanced quantum effects during primordial inflation. This is the source of cosmological perturbations and recent work has turned from these primary effects to secondary effects arising from loop corrections to the power spectra and other quantities. The PI will address these problems over the next three years by continuing work in six areas: Computing and fully renormalizing graviton loop contributions to 1PI 2-point functions in general gauges; defining nonlinear extensions of cosmological observables based on nonlocal functionals of the metric; computing the one and two loop expectation value of an invariant measure of spacetime expansion; studying nonperturbative secular effects using the scattering of matter quanta by inflationary gravitons; investigating nonlocal modified gravity models of inflation, of late time acceleration and of MOND; and exploring phenomenological implications of inflationary perturbations build up from past evolution."

Galaxy clusters are the most massive, gravitationally bound objects in our Universe, and their study has been pursued for several decades with the double aim of constraining cosmology and understanding structure formation. In the past these studies have mainly relied on optical and X-ray information. In the near future, new results are expected from wider and deeper optical surveys, high-resolution X-ray images, lensing studies and the analysis of the radio (and near-infrared) maps where clusters appear through the SZ effect.<br/><br/>This research will produce broad impacts in several areas, including a code optimized for cluster detection, and the public release of the Planck pre-launch catalog. A by product of the research will be the production of SZ observed maps from the simulations. These will be used to complete movies of cluster formation already developed for public outreach. An addition of this research is the training of new scientists by involving them in modern research. Part of this activity will involve scientists in applied mathematics, rendering it interdisciplinary and potentially useful for application in other fields of science. The international character of the collaborations will provide an opportunity for the young scientists involved to travel aborad, further strengthening their professional development and integration into the international scientific community."
0.599996,"Mapping neutral hydrogen throughout our Universe via its redshifted 21 cm line offers a unique opportunity to probe the cosmic ""dark ages"" and the formation of the first luminous objects. Moreover, because it can map a much larger volume of our Universe, it has the potential to overtake the cosmic microwave background as the most sensitive cosmological probe of the epoch of reionization, inflation, dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino masses. This potential has stimulated growing community interest, reflected by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) effort and the Astro2010 Decadal Review, with initial focus of technology development and demonstration.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a digital radio interferometer back-end with a novel architecture, test it with a 64 dual-polarization antenna array, and generate calibrated foreground maps covering much of the sky at 110-190 MHz, all of which will help further HERA development. By exploiting a hierarchical antenna grid and 4-dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), the proposed correlator cost scales as N log N with the number of independent elements rather than as N^2 like other HERA pathfinder experiments, allowing significant cost savings/collecting area increases down the road. Also, N independent sky beams are imaged simultaneously, improving mapping sensitivity. By exploiting the massive baseline redundancy in this antenna grid, gain and phase calibration for all antennas can be made significantly more accurate and fully automated. This can in turn produce more accurate modeling of the synthesized and primary beams, which has been shown to improve the quality of the foreground modeling and removal which is so crucial to 21 cm cosmology.<br/><br/>The proposed MIT Epoch of Reionization (MITEoR) instrument will be built on the NSF-funded open-source CASPER FPGA hardware platform, ensuring that the technology and instrumentation that we develop can be used by the worldwide community and incorporated into future HERA instruments, regardless of their antenna design and frequency range. In particular, most current visions for massive future radio arrays (like HERA-II and SKA) involve large compact cores, for which the technology that we will develop arguably offers both the lowest correlator cost and the most accurate calibration.<br/><br/>Along with strengthening the foundation for the emerging standard model of cosmology, this research should develop broadly useful technology, algorithms and tools. The hierarchical FFT imaging idea is also relevant to other areas, e.g., the search for radio transients and perhaps microwave background polarization.<br/><br/>As in the past, such products of our work useful to the broader community (data, algorithms, software, etc.) will promptly be made publicly available. The proposed research will also provide valuable student training. Furthermore, since the origin, evolution and fate of the universe have captivated the imagination of the general public, our group will continue to be very engaged in both formal and informal public outreach activities on this topic."

In order to achieve this, Professor Senatore will focus his attention on various projects that explore a wide range of topics in cosmology, ranging from theoretical aspects to subjects closer to the actual data. On the theoretical side, he will concentrate on applying modern quantum field-theoretical techniques to study the dynamics of inflation, the primordial phase of the universe, and the large-scale structures that we currently see around us.

As the samples of supernovae discovered by current and planned surveys grow, the precision of constraints on dark energy parameters hits a floor of systematic uncertainty. Dr. Jha will study the major limiting factors, with a goal of reducing current systematics by (1) characterizing the supernova (SN) host-galaxy dust extinction, (2) identifying more robust and precise subsamples of SNe Ia, and (3) constraining SN Ia progenitors, explosion models, and luminosity evolution through the study of peculiar objects. In addition, Dr. Jha will bring these cosmological tools to bear on a new problem: studying the dark matter distribution in clusters of galaxies using lensed SNe Ia whose absolute magnification can be measured in current surveys and planned observations with Rutgers' share of the Southern African Large Telescope. These projects will lay the groundwork for comprehensive studies of supernovae and time-domain astrophysics in general with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope as the results from this program will directly impact the design and execution of future supernova cosmology surveys. <br/><br/>Dr. Jha will also integrate this research into his and Rutgers' educational mission, with a primary focus on upper-division classes for science majors.

0.325254,"The ""Feedback in Realistic Environments"" (FIRE) project introduces exciting new ways to account for the effects of the earliest generation of stars, formed when the Universe is young, on the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, the large-scale tracers of cosmology, the science of the origin and evolution of the Universe. The FIRE computer models will include more of the important physics than has ever been done before, and early tests suggest this work agrees with observations more cleanly than previous studies, which had to include various arbitrary assumptions in order to make progress. The technical details within FIRE will also disentangle problems due to the uncertain physics of galaxy formation from problems caused solely by the limitations of computer modeling.<br/><br/>FIRE will carry out novel computational studies of galaxy formation using high-resolution cosmological simulations that resolve the interstellar medium (ISM) with unprecedented realism. Star formation injects large quantities of energy and momentum into the surrounding medium, and this stellar feedback generates galactic winds that affect the galactic environment. This project will run the first cosmological simulations that self-consistently include important stellar feedback physics. Combining a resolved, multiphase ISM with highly non-linear feedback interactions produces powerful galactic winds in broad agreement with observations, without using any of the ad hoc prescriptions which previous simulations have had to invoke. FIRE simulations will address the regulation of galaxy growth by stellar feedback, the properties of galactic inflows and outflows, the morphological transformation of galaxies, quenching of star formation in massive galaxies, active galactic nucleus feedback, the escape fraction of ionizing photons, and stellar feedback on dark matter halos. All of these simulations will be connected directly with multi-wavelength observations. In particular, simulated absorption line statistics compared with high-redshift measurements will test predictions of gas flows in and out of galaxies. Technical enhancements incorporated into FIRE will help to quantify the relative importance of numerical and physical uncertainties in galaxy formation modeling. The initial conditions of all FIRE simulations will be made available to the community to motivate others to follow this approach.<br/><br/>The project includes training of four graduate students, who will also learn from the collaborative interactions across three institutions. Visualizations from FIRE form a basis for outreach targeted at high school students, including workshops in computational thinking for teachers. Other efforts include seminars aimed at teachers, local astronomy enthusiasts, and students from underrepresented groups, working to explain the connection between local phenomena on Earth and the cosmic processes studied by FIRE."

With prior NSF and other support, the QUIET collaboration has constructed and deployed two large receiver arrays of correlation polarimeters, one for 44 GHz (Q band) and one for 95 GHz (W band), and has completed a successful nine month campaign of Q band observations producing outstanding results. The project team are now observing with the W-band receiver, which is the largest, most sensitive polarimeter array of any experiment to date. <br/><br/>Observations of the CMB, in particular the temperature anisotropies, are a cornerstone of precision cosmology, providing a wealth of information about the structure of the Universe and conditions at early times. CMB polarization observations add qualitatively distinct information, but only recently have reached the level of sensitivity to provide meaningful constraints on cosmological models. With more precise measurements of the angular power spectrum, QUIET will continue to test the standard cosmological model, further limiting proposed variants. This research will tighten the limits on CMB B-mode polarization signals generated either by foreground gravitational lensing or by primordial gravitational waves. These new deep observations will study polarized foregrounds, particularly synchrotron, at levels approaching those needed to extract cosmological information about primordial B-mode signals. In addition to their intrinsic interest, these foreground studies will enhance the interpretation of results from other contemporaneous CMB experiments and influence the design of future experiments.<br/><br/>Cosmology continues to captivate the public imagination. QUIET will contribute to understanding by disseminating the results and their context to a broad range of audiences. This research collaboration continues a strong tradition of training students through research, providing both technical and collaborative experiences as a foundation for future achievements. Because the observations are from a Chilean site, there is a special interest in academic and scientific cooperation with institutions there. The outreach program allows Chilean school science classes to design and carry out their own radio astronomy observations. QUIET is a global collaboration, with strong ties among US universities, federal research centers, and institutions outside the US."
0.06,"A remarkably cohesive description of our universe has emerged that confirms<br/>expectations with stunning precision yet simultaneously highlights compelling evidence<br/>for physics beyond our current understanding. Over 95% of the universe is in the<br/>unknown form of dark energy and dark matter. The scale of the dark energy is 15 orders of magnitude lower than the energy scale of dark matter, yet they fill the universe in comparable proportions today. The dark hierarchy is repeated, intriguingly, in a particle physics hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale. Attempts to address the particle hierarchy have invoked the existence of extra dimensions bringing a seemingly unrelated list of cosmological mysteries: How are the dimensions stabilized? Why are only three dimensions large? What could have driven anisotropic inflation in the early universe?<br/>The PI proposes that the dark components of the universe are linked to these other<br/>seemingly unrelated cosmological mysteries through one simple facet of the cosmos its<br/>geometry. The dark energy, she suggests, is Casimir energy, a necessary consequence of<br/>quantum mechanics on a finite space. Casimir energy can push the volume of space out<br/>or in, depending on the underlying quantum fields. A superposition of fields allows one<br/>to balance the forces and stabilize the extra dimensions. The dark matter, following<br/>existing suggestions in the literature, could be related to a lightest Kaluza-Klein particle,<br/>another direct consequence of ordinary quantum mechanics on a finite space. The<br/>hierarchy between scales, stabilization of dimensions, as well as early universe<br/>anisotropic inflation can be understood as consequences of these Casimir energies.<br/>The broader impacts of this proposal are that each year one or two undergraduate students from Barnard College, a women's college affiliated with Columbia University, will be involved in this research on dark components and extra dimensions. The students will learn to solve simple systems of differential equations that describe the expansion of a higher-dimensional cosmology. A complementary aspect of her project will involve dissemination of the ideas through public outreach supported by Barnard to girls in NYC high schools."
0.06,This proposal will explore how one can find a natural way to embed a period of<br/>cosmological inflation within recently proposed string theory compactification<br/>mechanisms. The first part of the research will consider a version of modular inflation<br/>called racetrack inflation developed by the PI and his collaborators. Modular inflation<br/>uses the potentials generated for the moduli fields that occur in string theory<br/>compactifications as the source of the negative pressure required for the inflationary<br/>period. In this picture the mechanism for reheating will be studied and the generation<br/>of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave background due to iso-curvature perturbations.<br/>The PI will also investigate other typed of inflation that can occur in string theory<br/>compactifications. The second aspect of the proposal will be a detailed study of<br/>D-Brane inflation. In this picture the scalar field responsible for inflation parameterizes<br/>the position of a brane along the internal manifold. One possible consequence of this<br/>picture is that during inflation there is brane-antibrane annihilation which could lead to<br/>the production of cosmic strings which have observable cosmological effects.<br/>The broader implications of this proposal are that If string theory can be directly verified<br/>(or falsified) by measurement of cosmological parameters this would be very important.<br/>The PI intends to create a web page for the general public explaining the main results of<br/>his work. He also intends to get involved with Physics Theory-Net and give lectures at<br/>local high schools.
0.66,"This award funds the research of the PI Lisa Randall in a number of areas of particle physics and cosmology which are related to the phenomenological consequences of warped extra dimensions. Chief among these are LHC-related research along with model building and research related to Dark Matter. Many models Randall discusses are designed to address the hierarchy problem. The hierarchy problem remains one of the outstanding motivations for believing that interesting Beyond-the-Standard Model physics should exist at the weak scale. The question of why there is such a large separation between the Planck scale and the weak scale, or even how a theory incorporating quantum mechanics and special relativity can consistently maintain two such very different mass scales without a highly unlikely fine-tuning remains the major theoretical issue today for weak scale particle physics. Warped extra-dimensional geometry can potentially resolve the hierarchy problem. In this scenario, the cut-off varies over an extra dimension so that although the cut-off of a five dimensional theory is of order of the Planck scale, the local cut-off on a brane (which we will call the TeV brane) is of order a TeV. Randall is also guided by connections to general relativity solutions, string theory, and cosmology. Some work will be devoted to particular models, such as Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped geometry and its experimental signatures, supersymmetry and search strategy and model building, Higgs physics, and flavor physics. In addition Randall and colleagues will consider other models for comparison and consider potentially interesting signatures. With dark matter they will investigate new classes of models and consider possible implications for the various experiments of different types of models. In addition Randall plans to engage in more theoretical work related to general relativity and cosmological solutions. <br/><br/>The project also has many broader impacts. With the onset of the LHC there are many opportunities to explain particle physics and science in general to the interested public.

In the area of cosmology a new model will be investigated, in which nonperturbative vacuum energy of a quantized field causes an acceleration of the recent expansion of the universe.<br/><br/>In relativistic astrophysics, recent surprises have dramatically improved the likelihood that the spin of rapidly rotating, newly formed neutron stars is limited by an instability driven by gravitational waves - and that the emitted waves may be detectable. Developing an accurate numerical solution for binary coalescence is crucial to maximize events that gravitational-wave detectors (LIGO and LISA, in particular) will see and to extract from observed events the physics of the coalescing objects.

Ground-based millimeter-wavelength surveys are underway and are detecting tens to hundreds of galaxy clusters by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal, in which high-energy electrons distort the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) through inverse Compton scattering, in which the low energy CMB photons receive energy boost during collision with the high energy cluster electrons. These surveys have presented their first measurements of the cluster number density evolution over cosmic time and can potentially provide precision measurements of structure growth. This, in turn, could discriminate between dark energy as a component of the Universe or as a manifestation of General Relativity's failure on the largest scales. Dr. Sehgal will build on her previous work to lead an analysis of the first cosmological constraints from an SZ-selected sample of galaxy clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. She will play a leading role in the determination of cosmological parameters from larger and more sensitive SZ cluster surveys and in upgrading simulations of the millimeter-wavelength sky by calibrating to the latest multi-wavelength observations. The latter will help reduce sources of systematic uncertainty in the cosmological analysis. Dr. Sehgal will also explore the feasibility of measuring cluster peculiar velocities using millimeter-wave simulations and thereby assess their utility as an alternative probe of structure growth.<br/><br/>Dr. Sehgal will also work with the New Jersey Astronomy Center for Education to develop and support several series of class modules that teach high-school students about key concepts in cosmology.

This would greatly enhance our understanding of the first luminous objects in the universe, and could enable precision cosmography and dark energy studies across cosmic time. During the epoch of reionization (EoR) the cosmological signal is about five orders-of-magnitude fainter than the astrophysical foregrounds. In principle the smooth spectral characteristics of the major foregrounds provide a dimension along which these foregrounds may be separated from the signal, but this separation is greatly complicated by instrumental effects which can mask the distinction.

The codes will be implemented on massively parallel computers (such as the Thinking Machine CM 5) which have the memory and the computing power to handle these large scale simulations. The end product will be a catalog of wave forms, relevant to producing appropriate detection algorithms for LIGO. This waveform catalog in particular will allow extraction of binary orbital information as well as of the black hole characteristics before and after merger of the two holes. Cosmological studies will concentrate on the formation of elements in the early universe, particularly in maintaining and upgrading existing computer codes at Texas. Areas to be emphasized will be newly measured nuclear reaction rates, the extension of nuclear reaction chains to include heavier elements, the refinement of numerical techniques in these codes, and the porti ng of the nucleosynthesis codes to large parallel machines. Other aspects of cosmology to be studied include the formation of structure in the early universe and the implementation of computer codes accurately describing it; and the statistics of gravitational lensing, (multiple images of distant QSOs caused by an intervening cluster of galaxies), and models of gravitational lenses. ***"
0.787369,"Redshifted emission from the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen has gained considerable attention as a unique tracer of the primordial intergalactic medium. This award will enable the PI to develop the foundation of a next generation of 21cm cosmology instrumentation, incorporating techniques and principles learned from his current Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) experiment. The PI will construct three prototype multi-element experiments that will allow him to study three distinct cosmological epochs: the cosmic dark ages, the epoch of reionization, and the onset of baryon acoustic oscillations. The antenna designs and digitization electronics from these experiments will in turn provide invaluable information on techniques to remove contaminating astrophysical foregrounds in future instruments.<br/><br/>The birth of the first luminous objects (stars, black holes) in the universe that ultimately stems from the Big Bang is one of the last unexplored phases of cosmic evolution. The instruments that will be produced as part of this award will facilitate transformational science in this area, and will provide key constraints on the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the evolution of cosmological expansion. The award will also enable the PI to train the next generation of instrument builders by offering internships for students at UC Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Laboratory. Finally, the PI will produce numerous public-domain pedagogical videos, which will enable a cadre of instrumentalists and students to quickly acquire basic proficiency in radio-astronomy instrumentation."
0.4,"The goal of this CAREER project from Professor Liam McAllister at Cornell University is to provide compelling theoretical models of the early universe -- in particular, models of inflation in string theory -- and to use these ideas to interpret the coming generation of cosmological observations. Cosmology has made spectacular strides in the last decade, emerging as a precise experimental science with profound connections to fundamental physics. Recent observations are remarkably consistent with the predictions of inflation, which describes explosive expansion before the hot Big Bang. Inflation builds on quantum field theory and general relativity, and is sensitive to the interplay between them, i.e. to the ultraviolet completion of gravity. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of inflation requires a theory of quantum gravity, such as string theory. Moreover, by probing inflation through cosmological observations, one can examine physics at the highest energy scales, and shed light on the physical laws that governed the beginning of our universe.<br/><br/>This activity is also envisioned to have significant Broader Impacts. Specifically, the PI plans to communicate some of the compelling, urgent problems at the core of modern physics to high-school students and science teachers in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in New York City. To achieve this, the PI will begin by lecturing to an audience of public school teachers from New York City; then hold a professional development workshop for interested teachers, focusing on key questions of modern physics outside the standard curriculum; and finally, visit participating teachers' classrooms. By forming and maintaining long-term relationships with teachers, the PI will be able to assess the results on an ongoing basis and recalibrate the presentations as needed. The PI will have the assistance of a dedicated Cornell outreach coordinator for all of these activities."
0.09,"In the Carolingian Renaissance (ninth-tenth centuries) was there any place for natural science, especially astronomy and cosmology, and did any notable innovation occur? Answering ""yes"" to this question, the project expands the cultural and institutional motivations of that renaissance and accords importance to the study of the natural world order. The revival and use of a set of four texts on astronomy and cosmology from the Roman Empire by Carolingian scholars, teachers, and students initiated a new stage in scientific awareness, advancing well beyond the focus of the previous three centuries upon time-keeping and the construction of calendars. New concepts of celestial order were more elaborated when using numbers and were distinctly novel and inventive in their attention to space. Routine studies of the heavens came to include diagrams, both for clarity and for instruction in new themes, during the ninth century. Both commentary and diagrams added to the four Roman texts provided not only explanations but also questions and alternatives to their contents. Diagrams especially were used to clarify, question, and redirect doctrines in these texts. Diagrams were a tool for the creation of hypotheses and models in Carolingian astronomy.<br/><br/>Teaching and research on astronomy and cosmology was enabled by the lending, copying, excerpting, and glossing of the ancient texts. Many Carolingian institutions participated, making the activity an essential part of the renaissance. Each of the texts stimulated a somewhat different set of interests and questions. Study of the many Latin manuscripts from the period shows attention to the following few among a large group of topics: planetary order, circumsolar planets, the different lengths of the four seasons, retrograde motion of planets, eccentric and epicyclic models of planetary motion, and the force of the sun as a planetary influence. These topics received discussion and diagrams by Carolingian scholars. Over the course of the ninth and early tenth centuries a tremendous body of new knowledge was created, a body of knowledge characterized primarily by qualitative models and complemented by subordinate quantitative data. The Carolingian Renaissance created anew an awareness of forms of planetary order and motion that had disappeared in late Antiquity. This understanding was an essential basis for further inquiry and development in the eleventh and twelfth centuries as Greco-Arabic astronomy was encountered and then actively sought.<br/><br/>The project is a library research topic, designed to study of medieval Latin manuscripts. Among the many copies of each text the variations in text, scholarly comments in margins, and varying diagrams added as explanations or questions reveal the different understandings of these texts by different Carolingian scholars at different times. As a result, the project will significantly advance knowledge in the history of science, the philosophy of science, the study of knowledge-transfer across cultures, and the historical study of the Carolingian Renaissance."
0.12,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This award supports several projects that study quantum effects related to cosmology and black holes. One of the most important ideas in cosmology today is that early in its history the universe underwent a process of extremely rapid expansion called inflation. Quantum effects would have been very important both during and shortly after this period of inflation. Many calculations of such effects use a classical (not quantum) treatment of gravity and a quantum mechanical treatment of everything else. The validity of this semi-classical approximation will be investigated both in the cosmological setting and near black holes. <br/><br/>The completion of these investigations will drive progress in our understanding of various phenomena ranging from the expansion of the universe to the effects of quantum fields on black holes. For example, if quantum fluctuations destabilize an exponentially expanding universe, predictions of its future and most inflationary scenarios will be affected. There is a long history of undergraduate and graduate students working with the PI on these types of projects and gaining training in both numerical and analytical research techniques."

Galaxy clusters are the most massive, gravitationally bound objects in our Universe, and their study has been pursued for several decades with the double aim of constraining cosmology and understanding structure formation. In the past these studies have mainly relied on optical and X-ray information. In the near future, new results are expected from wider and deeper optical surveys, high-resolution X-ray images, lensing studies and the analysis of the radio (and near-infrared) maps where clusters appear through the SZ effect.<br/><br/>This research will produce broad impacts in several areas, including a code optimized for cluster detection, and the public release of the Planck pre-launch catalog. A by product of the research will be the production of SZ observed maps from the simulations. These will be used to complete movies of cluster formation already developed for public outreach. An addition of this research is the training of new scientists by involving them in modern research. Part of this activity will involve scientists in applied mathematics, rendering it interdisciplinary and potentially useful for application in other fields of science. The international character of the collaborations will provide an opportunity for the young scientists involved to travel aborad, further strengthening their professional development and integration into the international scientific community."
0.00735,"This award provides support for the Buffalo-Case-Cornell-Syracuse Workshop on Cosmology in Fall 2010. This is the latest in a series of highly successful regional conferences covering aspects of physics at the interface between modern high-energy physics and cosmology. This is a particularly ripe time for research at the boundary between particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology. This is due, in large part, to the fact that data is soon expected to emerge from a plethora of experiments in both particle physics and astrophysics. These include the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), experiments seeking the direct and indirect detection of Dark Matter, and Cosmic Microwave Background probes such as Planck. Indeed, in many instances these different experiments are complementary to each other, each providing a different window into the as-yet-unexplored physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>NSF support of this conference will enable young researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to attend this conference at reduced expense. Participation by students and postdocs will enhance their education and promote their research. It will permit face-to-face interactions between physicists at different stages in their careers, allow all to network in an informal setting, enable them to share ideas and establish personal contacts, and provide younger researchers the opportunity to lively exhibit their own expertise through presentations of their research."
0.4,"This Career Proposal describes a research plan to exploit the holographic principle as a potential guide towards a unified theory of quantum mechanics, gravity and matter. The holographic principle relies on the covariant entropy bound that posits that the area of any spatial surface exceeds the entropy of matter in adjacent regions. Uncovering the origin of this bound will lead to a better understanding of quantum gravity. The PI will investigate the connection between this bound and the stability of matter as well as the uncertainty principle. The PI also plans to address the apparent tension between string theory and cosmology and use holography to better understand quantum aspects of cosmological models. In a broader context the PI intends to give lectures to High School students at the Berkeley science museum as well as design courses that integrate cosmology and particle physics that will be web accessible."

The PI proposes a five-year plan that can potentially resolve fundamental problems in cosmology and particle physics by developing new models that arise from theories beyond the standard model and quantum gravity. Additionally, he proposes new observational schemes to test these models. The PI's long-term research plans over the next five years focus on two themes. One is at the interface of particle physics and cosmology where he hopes to look at the consequences for LHC physics of his new model that unifies gravity with the electroweak force. He will also investigate the phenomenological consequences of a Supersymmetric extension of this model. The second area concerns the nature of the cosmological singularity. The PI has proposed several novel theories based on modifying gravity and will also consider the experimental consequences of these models. <br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The outreach part of this CAREER project will consist of the PI giving a two-week course on Music and the Cosmos, which will be hands on presentation on the physics of sound and musical instruments. These lectures will be presented to urban high school students. The PI will also serve as both a research and long-term career mentor for two minority undergraduate students each year, by creating two summer research positions in his group through this award."

Another subject of research is the possibility that galaxy and cluster formation is triggered by loops of ""cosmic string;"" the project will study the detailed evolution of loops, and also investigate cosmic string models that are consistent with a form of expansion of the universe that is called ""inflation"". The project will also attempt to ascertain the nature of the DM and the initial conditions by detailed study of the dynamics of disk galaxies and of the evolution of galaxies and their clustering, in anticipation of extensive new data. Finally, it will study the various theories of particle physics beyond the standard model both for their implications regarding the DM and for insights into the big unsolved problems of cosmology such as the value of the cosmological constant.

0.020555,"Understanding the origin of the Universe, cosmology, is one of humankind's fundamental endeavors. Close study of clusters of galaxies remains a critical element in this pursuit. The aim of this conference is for the first time to gather scientists worldwide for the study of cosmology with X-ray, Suyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) and associated astronomical observations of clusters.<br/><br/>One important feature of clusters of galaxies is the huge volume and mass of hot gas that permeates the space between member galaxies. This hot gas is visible in X-rays and is substantial enough that it causes the light remaining from the birth of the Universe---known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)---to shift ever so slightly toward the blue end of the light spectrum. This slight shift of the CMB is detectable and can be used to locate large clusters of galaxies over a wide range of distances and to measure important cosmological parameters that describe and characterize the origin of the Universe. This conference will bring together many American and international scientists involved in current X-ray and SZE experiments to discuss current progress, the latest results, and the many remaining puzzles. The unique aspect of this conference is to facilitate interactions of scientists focused on different observational approaches (i.e., X-ray, SZE, others) so that the community will gain greater insight by combining the knowledge base of these different approaches.<br/><br/>The proposed four-day conference is structured as a workshop to allow ample time for substantial discussions following each talk and each session. A key objective is to involve students and recent graduates. NSF, which is funding about 25% of the total estimated cost of the conference, will be primarily supporting the modest travel expenses of 30 students and recent graduates to attend the conference. The organizers are committing substantial effort to recruit speakers, participants, and students from groups underrepresented in the sciences. The organizers will also produce a volume of the proceedings, including all oral and poster presentations. Holding this conference in the United States will benefit many US students and scientists who would otherwise be unable to attend a similar or related conference overseas. Finally, the proposed effort should have a substantial impact on the training of young STEM researchers and to connect them with international collaborators---supporting the two NSF Strategic Goals that follow: To prepare and engage a diverse STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers. To keep the United States globally competitive at the frontiers of knowledge by increasing international partnerships and collaborations."
0.905944,"This proposal seeks continued support for observations with the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR). ACBAR is a 16 element 230-mK bolometer receiver designed to produce high resolution images of the CMB in three mm wavelength bands. Mounted on the 2.1m Viper telescope at the South Pole, ACBAR has sensitivity that rivals balloon-borne experiments and angular resolution that they cannot hope to achieve. Making full use of the excellent atmospheric conditions in the Austral winter at the South Pole, ACBAR is producing images of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation with sensitivity and resolution that exceed the capabilities of even the proposed Planck satellite. Observations of the CMB provide a unique window to the early Universe; these data play a key role in the transformation of Cosmology to a precise science. In particular, small angular scale observations of the CMB are a new frontier about which comparatively little is known. On these angular scales, contributions from secondary anisotropies introduced by intervening structure are expected to become dominant. For example, the scattering of photons by hot gas bound to clusters of galaxies results in a spectral distortion of the CMB known as the Sunyeav-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. Observations of the SZ effect can provide important new constraints on theories of the growth of Universe's structure. The unique capabilities of ACBAR allow it to address a broad range of science focused on measuring the primary and secondary anisotropies of the CMB. ACBAR was deployed to the South Pole in December 2000 and has been operating since. The second half of the winter of 2003 and the entire 2004 season will be dedicated to observations with ACBAR. The requested 18 months of support for observations with ACBAR and analysis of the resulting data will help to realize the full potential of this uniquely powerful instrument for the study of cosmology. The four institutions supported by this proposal will continue to collaborate in the maintenance and operation of ACBAR and Viper, and participate in the analysis of the data. The results from ACBAR will serve as a vital complement to the large-scale MAP spacecraft dataset, and provide an essential check of the fine-scale excess power reported by the single frequency BIMA and CBI experiments. The novel instrumentation, observation techniques, and analysis developed for ACBAR are generally applicable to future ground based millimeter astronomy experiments.

The instrument itself is a sixteen element bolometer array, operating at 0.03 deg K, designed specifically for observations of CMB anisotropy and the SZE. It will operate in atmospheric windows spanning millimeter to submillimeter wavelengths; extending the spectral range over which observations of anisotropies are made is necessary to separate cosmic microwave background signals from foreground contamination. The combination of sensitive detectors, high angular resolution, and broad frequence coverage the instrument will advance cosmology research on several fronts.

0.27,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vilenkin at Tufts University.<br/><br/>The theory of cosmic inflation, which was proposed as a speculative hypothesis 35 years ago, has by now accumulated substantial observational support and has become the leading cosmological paradigm. This theory has also led to a major change in our global view of the universe. According to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a ""bubble"" where inflation has ended, but it will never end in the entire universe. The total volume of inflating regions continues to grow, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. The major goal of the proposed research is to learn how this ""multiverse"" scenario can be tested observationally and to investigate its implications for the beginning of the universe. The multiverse worldview has far-reaching implications beyond physics. It provides a dramatically new perspective on the global structure of the universe and on our place in it. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the understanding of the properties of the universe. Professor Vilenkin will also involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He will continue his efforts to communicate the ideas of modern cosmology to the general public, in the form of public lectures, popular articles, and interviews for radio and TV. He will also write a textbook, emphasizing the new worldview, based on his undergraduate cosmology course, which is aimed at students with no preparation in science.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Vilenkin will investigate the possibility of a direct test of the multiverse scenario by observing collisions of our bubble with other bubbles, or with topological defects that could nucleate in the inflating background. Possible observational effects of such collisions will be studied using both analytic and numerical methods. A complementary approach is to analyze the statistical properties of the multiverse and use them to derive predictions for the observed values of the constants of Nature in our bubble. This approach will be pursued, with the main focus on the statistics of different states in the multiverse and of the transition rates between them. The general problem of making predictions in the multiverse, known as the measure problem, will also be addressed."
0.27,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Matthew B. Kleban at New York University.<br/><br/>Some contemporary theories of fundamental physics predict the existence of a so-called ""multiverse"" containing many distinct bubble universes. These bubbles collide, and collisions with our own bubble produce ""cosmic wakes"" that travel across our universe, creating specific patterns that are potentially observable with cosmological data from satellite- and ground-based observatories. The detection of such a collision would be a transformative discovery, demonstrating that our observable universe is a tiny part of a vastly larger whole populated by bubbles containing regions of highly exotic physics. It would confirm a prediction of string theory, provide crucial evidence for the nature of ""dark energy"", and permanently alter our view of the big bang. Professor Kleban will advance a program of research focused on those aspects of string theory and quantum gravity that predict effects --- like bubble collisions --- that can be tested with cosmological observations. Professor Kleban's ongoing research seeks to determine the microphysical origin of cosmic inflation, a period of explosive expansion that took place in the very early universe. As such, Professor Kleban's research advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. Professor Kleban's work will also continue to have broader impact in the form of public lectures and interviews, and in inspiring undergraduate and graduate physics students at NYU. On another front, Prof. Kleban will also train and assist in the professional development of a postdoctoral researcher who will participate in this project.<br/><br/>More technically, Prof. Kleban will attempt to realize a model known as ""unwinding inflation"" in a consistent, stabilized string theory compactification. This model has a number of notable advantages that might make it a plausible explanation for inflation, particularly the fact that it begins spontaneously from a generic meta-stable de Sitter phase in the string landscape. He will also continue his work on inflationary signatures of bubble collisions, tunneling, and other initial-state effects, as well as dynamical features produced during inflation that might indicate its microphysical origin. Lastly, he will continue to study string theory in strongly time-dependent settings, such as cosmology and relativistic brane scattering."
0.275111,"The ""Feedback in Realistic Environments"" (FIRE) project introduces exciting new ways to account for the effects of the earliest generation of stars, formed when the Universe is young, on the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, the large-scale tracers of cosmology, the science of the origin and evolution of the Universe. The FIRE computer models will include more of the important physics than has ever been done before, and early tests suggest this work agrees with observations more cleanly than previous studies, which had to include various arbitrary assumptions in order to make progress. The technical details within FIRE will also disentangle problems due to the uncertain physics of galaxy formation from problems caused solely by the limitations of computer modeling.<br/><br/>FIRE will carry out novel computational studies of galaxy formation using high-resolution cosmological simulations that resolve the interstellar medium (ISM) with unprecedented realism. Star formation injects large quantities of energy and momentum into the surrounding medium, and this stellar feedback generates galactic winds that affect the galactic environment. This project will run the first cosmological simulations that self-consistently include important stellar feedback physics. Combining a resolved, multiphase ISM with highly non-linear feedback interactions produces powerful galactic winds in broad agreement with observations, without using any of the ad hoc prescriptions which previous simulations have had to invoke. FIRE simulations will address the regulation of galaxy growth by stellar feedback, the properties of galactic inflows and outflows, the morphological transformation of galaxies, quenching of star formation in massive galaxies, active galactic nucleus feedback, the escape fraction of ionizing photons, and stellar feedback on dark matter halos. All of these simulations will be connected directly with multi-wavelength observations. In particular, simulated absorption line statistics compared with high-redshift measurements will test predictions of gas flows in and out of galaxies. Technical enhancements incorporated into FIRE will help to quantify the relative importance of numerical and physical uncertainties in galaxy formation modeling. The initial conditions of all FIRE simulations will be made available to the community to motivate others to follow this approach.<br/><br/>The project includes training of four graduate students, who will also learn from the collaborative interactions across three institutions. Visualizations from FIRE form a basis for outreach targeted at high school students, including workshops in computational thinking for teachers. Other efforts include seminars aimed at teachers, local astronomy enthusiasts, and students from underrepresented groups, working to explain the connection between local phenomena on Earth and the cosmic processes studied by FIRE."

The PI's on this project will investigate a wide range of innovative ideas in particle physics and cosmology: theoretical descriptions of the mechanisms of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions; collider phenomenology; grand unified theories and quantum gravity; dark matter and particle cosmology. Much of this research will be of direct relevance for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which recently started its operations et the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), as well as for several other upcoming landmark experiments.<br/><br/>This proposal is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The HEP Theory group at UC Irvine plans to play an essential role in UC Irvine's QuarkNet program, where high school teachers and their students are introduced to current research in high energy physics. These efforts will be complemented by additional public outreach activities, the training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and professional service."

Professor Suen will study various classical, semi-classical and quantum systems in general relativity and cosmology. The elasticity of a black hole horizon interacting with its environment will be analysed. A study of the properties and the formation process of oscillating soliton stars will be carried out. Gravitational collapses of quantum mechanical systems will be studied using the semi-classical Einstein equation. Dr. Suen will also study his recently proposed formulation of quantum cosmology, which requires no ad hoc theory of initial conditions. Also of interest is the probability of having the universe tunneling from one classical trajectory to another in terms of the quantum cosmological wave function."
0.08,"The search for a quantum theory of gravity has seen progress with the advent of string theory and loop quantum gravity, but both lack direct contact with experiment. The PI proposes a five-year plan that can potentially resolve fundamental problems in cosmology and particle physics by developing new models that arise from theories beyond the standard model and quantum gravity. Additionally, he proposes new observational schemes to test these models. The PI's long-term research plans over the next five years focus on two themes. One is at the Interface of Particle Physics and Cosmology where he hopes to look at the consequences for LHC physics of his new model that unifies gravity with the electroweak force. He will also investigate the phenomenological consequences of a Supersymmetric extension of this model. The second area concerns the nature of the cosmological singularity. The PI has proposed several novel theories based on modifying gravity and will also consider the experimental consequences of these models. The outreach part of this Career program will consist of <br/>the PI giving a two-week course on Music and the Cosmos, which will be hands on presentation on the physics of sound and musical instruments. These lectures will be presented to urban high school students through the Upward Bound Summer Science program at Penn State. The PI will also serve as both a research and long-term career mentor for two minority undergraduate students each year, by creating two summer research positions in his group through this award."
0.075,"The PI proposes to study aspects of particle physics beyond the standard model that will potentially be tested within the next decade, and that may fill some of the gaps in our current understanding of particle physics and cosmology. The PI has proposed several new ideas which deserve exploration This proposal focuses on studying aspects of Supersymmetry, Higgs physics and the possible role of extra dimensions, all of which will be studied in upcoming collider experiments at the LHC, or possibly even at the Tevatron. The PI also proposes to study the interplay of neutrino physics and cosmology, a timely endeavor now that observational cosmology and the various neutrino experiments have posed certain puzzles in the neutrino sector that require explanation. The major part of the proposal is devoted to supersymmetric extensions <br/>of the standard model. First there is a plan to improve a theory with an interesting pattern of the soft-breaking terms, in which the gauginos obtain Dirac masses, rather than the usual Majorana masses. <br/>Such scenario faces several tight experimental constraints. The second project concerns the fine-tuning associated with the bounds on the Higgs mass. A theory that is less fine tuned might be obtained <br/>by using little Higgs mechanism that operates at low energies after supersymmetry is broken. The third project proposes to increase the upper bound on the mass of the lightest Higgs particle in the minimal supersymmetric standard model."

0.06,"For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics. This is true chiefly because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetic). Results from string theory have also spilled over into many other branches of physics, leading to improved understanding of gauge theories, condensed-matter physics, and heavy-ion physics. String theory has also led to powerful new insights in mathematics. In this project, Professor Blanco-Pillado aims to apply string theory to cosmology. Specifically, he proposes to study the cosmological implications of a certain class of string models (so-called ``flux compactifications''), paying particular attention to the effects of the complex structure moduli part of the four-dimensional potential.<br/><br/>This project will also have significant broader impacts. Beyond the interdisciplinary reach of the proposed research --- connecting high-energy physics and cosmology through the paradigm of string theory --- this project will also involve the training of a graduate student to conduct research in this cutting-edge field of study."

Advances and discoveries in one field have had profound consequences on the other. This is particularly true for our understanding of gravity. These days the major common arena has moved from the study of orbital dynamics to cosmology. The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe is perhaps one of the best examples of how the two fields are currently intertwined. The study of the beginnings of our Universe is another rich frontier. The work of Professor Zaldarriaga will improve our theoretical understanding of the early universe and the observable consequences of our current models. It will improve our modeling of the astrophysics of several cosmological probes and will further our theories for the late time evolution of the universe, thus helping address the outstanding mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.<br/><br/>This project has considerable broader impacts, including the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

It will be hosted by the University of Hue and is supported by BCVSPIN (Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Nepal) a group that supports this area of science. The U.S. organizer is Professor Qaisar Shafi at the University of Delaware in Newark. Other sponsors are the University of Virginia in Blacksburg; Hue University College of Education in Vietnam; the Institute of Physics in Hanoi, Vietnam and the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. In addition to participation from the countries mentioned above, it will also include scientists and graduate students from Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and Thailand. The scientific motivation for this Institute is based on the premise that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) now operating at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland will be able to unlock some of the deepest secrets of the universe. There are many experimentalists and theoretical physicists racing to discover new laws of physics. Such discoveries could greatly alter the face of physics. The main research areas to be discussed include: 1) the origin of mass; 2) the origin of matter in the universe; 3) the nature of dark matter particles; and 4) supersymmetric nature. In addition, they will discuss if there may be complimentary ground-breaking satellite and terrestrial experiments that are helping lay the foundations of modern (post big-bang) cosmology. Each of the above topics will be discussed in depth by leading experts from the U.S. and Europe. The principle lectures will be held during the morning and afternoon, and the evenings will be reserved for discussion and support sessions. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that this Institute will facilitate the creation of global scientific networks among physicists from the U.S. and Asian institutions. It also provides an exceptional opportunity for interaction between U.S. scientists and students with their counterparts. U.S. researchers could select Asian graduate students and postdocs to work at their home institutions and invite faculty members for short research stays in order to engage in new collaborative projects. It will also provide the young Asian scientists and students, who often lack access to conferences, journals and scientific exchange, the opportunity to interact with world class experimentalists and theorists in particle physics and cosmology thereby allowing them to keep abreast of the most recent developments and perhaps even provide them a venue for presenting their ideas and work as well."

The co-organizers are Professor John Carlstrom at the University of Chicago and Professor Naoki Itoh at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan. The meeting will bring together research scientists from the U.S. and Japan, two countries where new instrumentation and technologies, as well as new theoretical developments in this area of science are now emerging as a powerful probe of cosmology. The Japanese participants will include Dr. Rashid A. Sunyaev, the father of the field. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect is a small spectral distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (the remnant glow from the big bang) due to its interaction with large-scale structure as the radiation traversed the universe. The SZE can be used as a powerful probe of cosmology as it provides a sensitive probe of the formation and evolution history of structure in the universes. <br/><br/>The co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field. This enables them to evaluate and attract the best physical scientists to participate. It is expected that the new SZE surveys offer an independent method for probing the properties of the enigmatic dark energy which is believe to be the dominate energy density in the universe today and yet defies explanation by conventional physics. The seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve a large number of postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.

12.981621,"AST-0408698<br/>Page<br/><br/>Exciting recent discoveries in observational and theoretical cosmology have given us a glimpse of new fundamental physics. Our conception of the contents and fate of the Universe is clearer and dramatically different than it was just five years ago. We now believe the Universe is geometrically flat and comprised of ~5% baryons, ~30% dark matter, and ~65% a new form of dark energy. Through a highly interlocking program of observations, sophisticated data analysis, and theory, the researchers involved in this collaborative project expect to expand our knowledge well beyond the capabilities of the current generation of investigations. <br/><br/>A revolution in detector technology, namely thousand-element bolometric arrays, has opened the door to new discoveries about the physical Universe. This group will couple a three-color millimeter camera based on these field-tested arrays to a specialized, 6-meter diameter telescope to be located at an altitude above 5000 m in Chile. Observations with this instrument can map out the formation of cosmic structure from the high-redshift (z > 1000) linear regime through the low-redshift (z < 5) non-linear regime when structures form. Optical spectroscopy with 10-meter class telescopes and measurements with modern X-ray satellites will enable the determination of the redshifts and masses of hundreds of galaxy clusters, the latest stage of cosmic evolution. Through a combination of observations - Cosmic Micowave Background (CMB), optical, X-ray - the researchers will probe the picture of the Universe to greater depths than have yet been plumbed. <br/><br/>Goals of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) project are to: 1. Map the CMB temperature anisotropy over 100 square deg, beyond the resolution limits of the WMAP (operating) and Planck (launch 2007) satellites. The primary anisotropy constrains the fundamental physics of the infant Universe and provides the initial conditions for structure formation; the secondary anisotropies reflect the emergence of structure. 2. Find and study galaxy clusters in the CMB map region through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and determine the spectroscopic redshifts of over 400 of them. The masses of these clusters will be measured with X-ray observations and with galaxy velocity dispersions. 3. Combine the high fidelity CMB map data and the cluster measurements to find the equation of state, w = p/p of the ""quintessence"" or ""dark energy"" to +0.1. 4. Limit or determine the mass of the neutrino to +0.1 eV from the combined CMB map and cluster measurements. 5. Use the CMB maps to construct gravitational lensing displacement maps at 0.2 degree resolution, which will probe the total mass distribution directly on length scales of 1 Mpc at z ~ 1 to 2. This technique is independent of and complementary to lower redshift galaxy surveys (which involve bias). 6. Detect reionization of the Universe from the formation of the first stars at z ~ 10 through the Ostriker-Vishniac effect in the CMB.<br/><br/>This research team will conduct a range of activities in education, outreach, and technology transfer in conjunction with the ACT project. One program of special note gives research experience to minority students at City University of New York. Undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdocs will receive advance training through participation in all aspects of the ACT project. Cosmology research captures the public imagination, and the results of this project are expected to generate considerable media attention.

0.0375,"Project Description: This project provides support for 15 U.S. scientists to participate in an international conference on gravitation and cosmology to be held in Goa, India, 14-19 December 1987. The meeting is sponsored by the Indian Association for General Relativity and Gravitation, in cooperation with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, and with major scientific institutions in India engaged in research in this area. Topics to be covered include spacetime structure, exact solutions, relativistic astrophysics, gravitational experiments, gravitational radiation, cosmology, the early universe, quantum fields in curved spacetimes, quantum gravity and new directions in gravitation theory. Project Significance: The conference deals with an area of science where major developments have taken place recently. These developments have made interactions with Indian scientists important since India has a distinguished tradition in the area of general relativity and there are a number of first rate scientists in this area working there now. The speakers are very distinguished scientists from the U.S. and from India on the subjects of general relativity, cosmology, particle physics and astrophysics.

3.061692,"The Princeton experimental program is centered on measurements of the angular distribution of the thermal cosmic background radiation (the CBR) and its spectrum and absolute temperature. These are a proving ground for scenarios of galaxy formation; if the scenario is simple we may find encoded in the angular distribution the values of key cosmological parameters. The spectrum at wavelengths greater than about 3 cm should be better explored to improve constraints on the history of interactions of matter and radiation. This group's measurements from Saskatoon detect the power spectrum of irregularities in the CBR on angular scales from about 0.5 to 3. They will improve these detections with their ground-based telescope and to build a balloon-borne instrument that produces a map of the anisotropy. Better measurements of the CBR anisotropy require more sensitive and stable detectors and radiometers. They will build and test a new 90 Ghz HEMT-based (High Electron Mobility Transistor) radiometer and to develop a small array of broad-band SIS receivers for 90 Ghz. They will also continue developing the techniques to search for long-wavelength distortions in the spectrum. The objective of this research is to advance knowledge, through both theory and experiment, of the evolution and large-scale structure of the universe. New telescopes and improvements in detector sensitivities over a broad range of energies have yielded a much enlarged fund of data that confront a multitude of options within the standard cosmological model. The Princeton group expects that within a decade additions to the data and a careful evaluation of the theoretical options the data allow will yield a new test of general relativity theory, and, through an improved check of consistency of the cosmological model, will sharply restrict models for the formation of galaxies and their large-scale distribution, and perhaps tell us whether the universe is open or closed. Education is central t o this research. The group places a strong emphasis on undergraduate teaching; on average, the group supervises six undergraduates each summer and ten independent research projects during the school year. Though many go on in physics, quite a few continue their education in medicine, engineering, or law. Educating graduate students also has high priority."
2.15,"The investigators in this group propose to work on outstanding questions in physics. What is the Nature of the Universe and what is it made of? What are matter, energy, space and time? How did we get here and where are we going? from the theoretical standpoint. Theoretically, string theory has undergone major developments in the last several years in techniques as well as emerging cosmological applications. Many new possibilities of physics beyond the standard model that were not considered in the past have recently emerged. Connection between particle physics and physics underground or in space is becoming stronger than ever.. This proposal attempts to address these major questions from many possible directions Specifically, the PIs propose to take the following approach. Ganor proposes to do research in M-theory, string theory, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, field theories in higher dimensions,and to search for possible tests of string theory and M-theory in cosmology. Gaillard studies effective supergravity theories at the quantum level, with an emphasis one those derived from the weakly coupled heterotic string. She will explore the implications for collider physics and cosmology of these theories. Hall plans to study issues of electroweak symmetry breaking, and connections between particle physics and cosmology, such as how inflation and dark energy can be incorporated into fundamental theories that connect to scales of unification and to neutrino masses. Murayama proposes to study physics behind the electroweak symmetry breaking, underground physics such as neutrino physics and proton decay, dark matter and cosmology, and dynamics of field theory. Zumino studies various aspects of noncommutative quantum field theories and (super)string theories and tries to go beyond the known mathematical techniques to develop a deformation quantization of differential forms (for gauge theories) and a functional super-star product for (super)string field theory. The broader impact is that the PIs provide training to students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists of the nation as well as the world.

The dark matter halos represent intermediate, but very important link between cosmological models, which deal with global parameters of the Universe and observations (e.g., power spectra of galaxies, different statistics of velocities of galaxies, rotational velocities of dark matter dominated galaxies). Theoretical predictions are uncertain and inconsistent. There is no consensus regarding projiles in the central parts (slope of the cusps). The PI is carrying out extensive simulations that will resolve the issues and produce reliable results concerning structure and distribution of dark matter halos.

0.4,"This award supports the development of Cello, a new parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) software framework. The purpose of Cello is to enable researchers to write multi-physics AMR applications that can harness the enormous computing power of current and future world-class high- performance computing (HPC) platforms. The distinguishing characteristic relative to existing AMR frameworks is the aggressive pursuit at the onset of extreme scalability, both in terms of software data structures and hardware parallelism. Integral to developing Cello will be developing Enzo-P, a petascale astrophysics and cosmology application built on top of the Cello framework. Enzo-P will not only help drive development of the underlying Cello framework, but it will serve as a highly scalable variant of the Enzo terascale astrophysics and cosmology community code. Both the Enzo-P science application, and the underlying independent Cello parallel AMR software framework, will be released and supported as community software.<br/><br/>Software sustainability will be realized under the dual support of the Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (LCA) at the University of California San Diego, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, organizations devoted to the long-term maintenance of---and user support for---community scientific codes and HPC cyberinfrastructure. Software self-management will be an integral component of the Cello software design, with software resilience a high priority. The Cello framework will be designed to detect hardware and software faults, identify performance and numerical issues, and dynamically reconfigure to always perform with the highest possible efficiency on currently available hardware components. Energy efficiency can be considered implicit in the underlying adaptive mesh refinement approach, which dynamically targets computational resources where they are required, and avoids expending resources where they are not. The adaptivity of AMR translates directly to energy savings. This project synthesizes the best practices of existing parallel AMR frameworks and adds several innovations that improve the quality of the mesh for various types of simulations. A hierarchical approach to parallelism and load balancing is taken while enforcing locality to the maximum while relaxing global synchronization to a minimum. This will enable the construction of AMR applications of unprecedented spatial and temporal dynamic range on tomorrow's hierarchical HPC architectures. Adaptive mesh refinement has proven to be a powerful numerical technique in a wide variety of disciplines in the pure and applied sciences and engineering. Existing frameworks will probably not be scalable to tens and hundreds of millions of cores, meaning that existing applications built on them will need to move to more scalable and fault tolerant frameworks. Cello is being built with these applications in mind. The broader impacts of this software development will come through the science and engineering applications that Cello supports, as well as novel design principles it embodies."

0.242607,"AST 98-02568 David H. Weinberg Dr. Weinberg proposes to work with Dr. Katz (University of Massachusetts) and Dr. Hernquist (University of California, Santa Cruz) to conduct numerical simulations that model the cosmic history of the baryon component of the universe from z ~ 8 to the z=0, with particular attention to the Ly a forest, high redshift galaxies and the distributions of galaxies and intergalactic gas in the local universe. They plan to use TreeSPH - a numerical simulation code that combines a hierarchical tree N-body algorithm for gravitational components with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for the gas component. The code now exists in parallel form. According to the leading cosmological theories, the galaxies and large scale structure that we observe today grew by gravitational instability from small-amplitude fluctuations in the early universe. Gravitational clustering of collisionless dark matter drives the evolution of the mass distribution on large scales, but astronomical observations reply almost exclusively on electromagnetic radiation that has been emitted (or in some cases absorbed) by stars or gas. Hydrodynamic simulations, which incorporate the non-gravitational physics that influences the evolution of the cosmic baryon distribution, dramatically enhance the predictive and explanatory power of cosmological theories. Preliminary results from the simulations show that a substantial population of high redshift galaxies is predicted by several variants of the cold dark matter scenario. The team is studying the clustering of Lyman break galaxies in different scenarios. Hydrodynamic simulations show that the low column density Ly a forest arises primarily in diffuse, smoothly fluctuating, intergalactic gas. The physics of this medium is remarkably simple, allowing the simulations to make robust, quantitative predictions given a specified cosmological model. Simulations of high redshift structure, supported by QSO absorption data, indicate that most of t he high redshift baryons reside in the diffuse medium that produces the Ly a forest, with smaller fractions in galaxies and hot gas halos. ***"

The numerical techniques developed for this purpose will be applicable to a multitude of other astrophysical problems such as the formation of Population I and II stars, cosmological reionization, chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium, galaxy formation, supermassive black hole formation, gamma ray burst afterglows, and supernova remnants. All new numerical codes will be released to the scientific community.<br/><br/>In addition to his research, Dr. Abel will continue to produce animations for the public, and develop visualizations for students and the public that make use of state-of-the-art immersive technology. He will also develop courses on numerical astrophysics and cosmology that will train students to apply public N-body and radiation hydrodynamics codes to model a variety of astrophysical phenomena."
0.071204,"This collaborative project will bring to light an overlooked astronomical controversy of previously unsuspected importance for the interpretation of the Copernican revolution. Johannes Regiomontanus was the leading mathematical astronomer of the fifteenth century; his critical analysis of Ptolemy's `Almagest` provided an important stimulus for Copernicus's development of his sun-centered model of the solar system. Regiomontanus's `Defense of Theon against George of Trebizond` is a very rich but completely unstudied 573-page attack on Trebizond's presentation of the `Almagest,` the work that Copernicus would eclipse. This work of Regiomontanus's illuminates the most important known clue about the emergence of Copernicus's cosmology, for it fleshes out Regiomontanus's reasoning in proposing the alternative models that Copernicus would later use. In this collaborative project the PIs will transcribe and analyze Regiomontanus's lengthy text, present their most important results in four preliminary articles, and begin the monograph they will write about this astronomical controversy and its significance in the history of cosmology. The project will be done in collaboration with Michael Shank at the University of Wisconsin, who is funded separately for this work through grant SBR9729712."

This research program is aimed at understanding M-theory and string theory by analyzing the physics of D-branes, which are solitonic objects in string theory. The research is concerned with constructing and understanding D-branes in novel string backgrounds that do not have a geometrical description (e.g. group manifolds, orientifolds). These branes can be used as probes of these backgrounds, and this opens up the possibility of constructing the geometry of non-geometrical spaces!

0.804263,"There is mounting evidence that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a subnuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale at which Inflation occurred. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor-to-scalar modes, r = T/S. Many theoretically favored models of Inflation produce this ratio between 0.01 and 0.1, corresponding to average amplitude from 30 to 100 nanoKelvins for the resulting CMB B-mode polarization patterns where they peak on scales of degrees. With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and ultimately detecting the CGB polarization signature, which is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. In 2005, the Community Task Force on CMB Research identified a target sensitivity of that ratio equaling to 0.02 as an immediate goal to detect the Inflationary gravitational waves imprint in the CMB polarization that pertain to the standard cosmological model. The newly installed 'Small Polarimeter Upgrades for DASI' (SPUD) reconfigured a five- receivers telescope to the ""South Pole Inflationary Cosmology Experiment"" (SPICE) that will: (a) Complete the CGB search in CMB B-mode polarization at 150 GHz, reaching depths which based on current sensitivity performance, that will detect the Inflationary CGB for r > 0.02; (b) Prove that this signal is cosmic in origin while separately measuring the Galactic foreground contamination at its minimum; (c) Detect gravitational lensing of CMB polarization on scales of ~1 degree, probing the CGB to the lensing confusion limit for degree-scale observations (r < 0.01) if the energy scale of Inflation is low; and (d) Surpass the instrumental sensitivity goals set forth for 2013 by the 2005 CMB Task Force recommendations. Detection of the CGB waves would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang theory. Indeed, its impact may be even broader as nuclear physics had matured enough prior to the establishment of the ""hot"" Big Bang model, while Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics: the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics, string theory, and the highest accessible energies.

0.4,"This CAREER grant supports the research of Professor Justin Khoury at the University of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>As is now increasingly well understood, the energy density of the universe is dominated by contributions from a so-called ""dark sector"". As part of his research, Professor Khoury will explore the tantalizing prospect that the dark sector includes new light degrees of freedom that mediate long-range forces on cosmological scales, affecting both dark and baryonic matter. To ensure consistency with laboratory and solar system tests of gravity, some screening mechanism is necessary to ""hide"" these degrees of freedom locally. Professor Khoury therefore aims to probe the theoretical underpinnings of this idea, and fully develop the observational implications of existing screening theories. He also aims to devise novel screening mechanisms within the framework of consistent effective field theories. Professor Khoury will also study a new cosmological framework which he recently developed which might eliminate the need for an early inflationary period of cosmological evolution. This framework, which he calls the ""pseudo-conformal universe"", provides alternate solutions for many of the classic problems that are also solved by inflation.<br/><br/>Professor Khoury's activities are also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Khoury will design a freshman seminar for non-science majors, with invited guest lecturers from a new public lecture series hosted jointly by the Center for Particle Cosmology, Penn's Women Studies, and Penn Women's Center. The lecture series will contribute to broader representation of women in science by featuring leading women physicists.

1.650001,"Debate surrounding resource use and conservation by indigenous peoples has shifted away from tests of the ""noble savage"" hypothesis of the 1970s and 1980s towards analysis of the multiple social, economic, and biological factors that affect the sustainability of resource use. Hunting practices in particular among many indigenous groups are probably strongly regulated by internal controls, based on a combination of spiritual beliefs (cosmology), social rituals, and natural history knowledge. Despite the evidence for the key role of cosmology in regulating resource use, most work on game overexploitation and the abandonment of traditional hunting practices by indigenous peoples, particularly in the Neotropics of Central America and northern South America, has focused on the effects of market integration and ignored spiritual and other cultural practices. This research project will test the fundamental hypothesis that retention of traditional practices and cosmology by indigenous societies buffers them against the process of integration into the national society, thereby preventing biodiversity and ecosystem degradation by the indigenous societies themselves. This hypothesis will be evaluated by quantifying resource-use practices and biodiversity status among communities of one ethnic group that differ in their degree of retention of traditional cosmology and practices. The project will be based in the 1.7 million-hectare Raposa Indigenous Area in the northern Brazilian Amazon. The dynamics of hunting by the Macuxi people of this region offer an excellent system for bridging theory and practice in the study of complexity. Hunting practices and degree of integration to Brazilian society vary among 206 villages distributed across the heterogeneous landscape in Raposa. A mechanistic model of animal population dynamics and human hunting practices will be developed and tested using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Socioeconomic data, wildlife data, and remotely sensed data will be collected, integrated, and analyzed within a geographic information system. In addition to a better understanding of human-biodiversity linkages in indigenous areas, outcomes of this project will include (1) educational materials for the Macuxi and the institutions that work with them, (2) a distance-linked graduate seminar in which students collaborate across departments, campuses and disciplines, (3) broadening of the participation of women and minority students in science, and (4) enhancement of the infrastructure for science by linking institutions with different areas of specialty into a teaching and research network that will benefit students who would normally have access only to their own institution.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the development of effective development policies and biodiversity conservation and will help provide theoretical background for coupled human-natural systems in the subsistence or semi-subsistence societies that characterize much of tropics. Research results will be relevant to discussions on the role of overkill by low technology hunters in Pleistocene extinctions and the synergistic effects of environmental conditions and forms of social organization and decision making on the intensity of natural resource depletion. The results will be particularly germane for the ongoing debate on the role of ""people in parks"" and on the contribution that indigenous peoples will make to biodiversity conservation worldwide. The geographical location of this study is significant unto itself. Roraima covers a large portion of the unstudied and largely unmanaged high diversity Guiana Shield forest-savanna transition. The area, which grades from dry savannas through mesic and wet forests to montane cloud forest and tepui habitats, represents one of the last wilderness areas on Earth. For this key ecological area, the future of biodiversity lies in the hands of indigenous peoples. This study will provide key insights regarding how the internal cultural dynamics of indigenous societies influence and are influenced by biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, with implications for human-environment interactions in Raposa and elsewhere where indigenous peoples retain an important presence. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

The explosion of recent and forthcoming data from numerous observational programs places a burden on theorists for testable predictions. Studying dark matter halo structure and substructure leads to profound connections among these fields. Dr. Zentner will undertake detailed theoretical studies of the formation of dark matter halos, particularly halo substructure and satellite galaxies, that will yield fundamental improvements in our understanding of galaxy formation and that will constrain dark matter properties and inflation. These studies aim to make definitive predictions for the properties of dark matter subhalos and galaxy observables in the standard cold dark matter cosmology and selected alternative models. The primary tools for these studies are: (1) high-resolution cosmological numerical simulations of halo assembly; (2) targeted simulations of subhalo and galaxy evolution within larger systems; and (3) analytic models of halo merging and substructure evolution. These studies have several revolutionary aspects, including resolving phase-space-limited cores in self-consistent simulations of alternative dark matter and improving the basic framework of halo merger statistics that forms the foundation of most galaxy formation models.<br/><br/>Dr. Zentner will also undertake an educational program at Chicago's Young Women's Leadership Charter School (YWLCS) aimed at encouraging urban young women to pursue careers in science.

0.251999,"My research deals with mathematical problems involving gravity which arise in astrophysics. Specifically my research will involve (1) proving decay of solutions to the initial-value problem for Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and for gravitational waves, both in a Kerr rotating black hole geometry; (2) studying shock waves and expansion waves arising in general relativity; (3) magnetic rotating and non-rotating Newtonian stars. Part 1 continues previous work on decay results for the Dirac and scalar wave equations, to Maxwell's equations and to the linearized Einstein equations in a KBH background geometry. Part 2 deals with shock waves and expansion waves in general relativity, and applying these wave solutions to problems in astrophysics; e.g. the so-called anomalous acceleration of the universe, without needing dark energy or the cosmological constant. It is based on my rigorously obtained new solutions of the Einstein equations. Part 3 arises from my recent results on existence and stability results for rotating Newtonian stars and is aimed at extending these results to magnetic stars (like our sun). This study is motivated by an attempt to better understand sunspots and solar flares, from a rigorous mathematical point of view.<br/><br/>The proposal is focused on three areas of astrophysics. The first involves studying whether black holes are stable under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbation. That is, if one sends an electromagnetic or gravitational wave into a rotating black hole, will the black hole remain pretty much intact, or will it radiate away a good portion of its energy? The second is to continue my work on new solutions of Einstein's equations explaining the so-called anomalous acceleration of the universe. That is, the standard physical model modifies Einstein's equations in an ad hoc manner and involves the notion of ""dark energy"", an unobserved anti-gravitational force, in order to agree with astronomical observations. This approach has no physical basis whatsoever. The final area of interest to me is to study start with magnetic fields with an aim to getting a theoretical explanation of sunspots and solar flares. These phenomena remain highly mysterious, and are important since when they occur, they disrupt satellite as well as radio communication.

0.456149,"The extragalactic universe is abundant with sources that are associated with the most powerful persistent phenomenon in the universe: accreting supermassive black holes that form Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Numerous AGN launch relativistic twin jets of plasma from the immediate vicinity of their black holes which, when oriented close to the line of sight to the observer, give rise to a class of AGN named blazars. <br/><br/>Observations by the Fermi satellite and ground based imaging Cerenkov telescopes show that many blazars are prodigious sources of gamma-rays at tera-electronvolt (TeV) energies. Their impact on the energetics of the universe, however, has previously been thought to be slim since their luminous output is a minor component of the total radiative power in the universe. However, recent work by the PI and his collaborators suggest that TeV blazars are, in fact, remarkable sources of energy. By studying pair beams (electron-positron pairs that are produced when photons from TeV blazars meet extragalactic background light photons) the PI argues that blazars are the dominant heat source in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts 2-3. This would have substantial implications for the evolution of the universe.<br/><br/>The PI will perform a detailed analysis of the cosmological implications of TeV blazars, which will touch on many different areas of astrophysics: from linear plasma instabilties, to weak turbulence and thermalization, to thermodynamics of the IGM, and to the formation of galaxies and clusters. He will (1) investigate the plasma physics of ultrarelativistic pair beams, (2) set blazar heating in a cosmological context, and (3) explore the implications of his work for the structure formation of the universe.<br/><br/>The PI will disseminate his research to a broad audience in numerous ways. First, he will reimagine introductory physics classes at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), by combining traditional lectures with online video lessons and exercises. He will also work closely with the Astronomy Club at UWM by recruiting undergraduates and high school teachers for semester and summer research projects.

0.135,"Among of the most exciting events of recent years has been the mounting evidence that the very early universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion known as primordial inflation. During primordial inflation there is a vast enhancement of quantum effects, which are ordinarily very small. These quantum effects can become so strong that conventional techniques for computing them break down. The main goal of this project is to develop new techniques for reliably computing these quantum effects, so that people can know precisely what they are. Another goal is to search for observable consequences of these enhanced quantum effects that may be masquerading as modifications of the gravitational force.<br/><br/>Such a study is interesting because many aspects of the current universe can only be understood, without using quantum effects, by supposing that cosmological evolution is driven by enormous quantities (about 96% of the total) of exotic mass and energy that has not been detected in Earth-bound laboratories. It is possible that some of the inexplicable features of cosmology are the result of quantum effects that became strong during primordial inflation. The broader impacts of this project lie in the promotion of teaching, training and learning."
0.015,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Brian Fields at the University of Illinois and Professor Lloyd Knox at the University of California Davis.<br/><br/>The theory of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--in the first seconds of the big bang. BBN predictions for cosmic light-element abundances are in broad agreement with observations; this concordance is a major success of the hot big bang model. Moreover, BBN provides a measure of the ordinary matter (""baryon"") content of the universe, as well as total content in relativistic particles (""radiation"") in both visible and invisible form (e.g., neutrinos and any other forms of ""dark light""). In the past decade, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a precise and independent measure of cosmic baryons. Comparing BBN and CMB baryon measures thus has provided a new fundamental test of the hot big bang cosmology, and reveal a ""lithium problem."" This BBN/CMB connection is now poised to open qualitatively new possibilities. Recent and upcoming measurements of the CMB for the first time will simultaneously probe not only cosmic baryons, but also cosmic radiation as well as the helium abundance itself. This will enable powerful new tests of cosmology: for the first time, the predictions of BBN can be tested entirely with very precise CMB data. Agreement would dramatically demonstrate the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics. Professors Fields and Knox will both evaluate and interpret the BBN-CMB comparison, develop tools to efficiently and accurately compare BBN and CMB data. For the first time, a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach will be used to evaluate BBN uncertainties; this will allow a direct and consistent means of combining BBN predictions and CMB data and statistically characterizing the results. As part of this analysis, a new open-source BBN code will be produced, tested, and publicly released.<br/><br/>It is expected that this work will have substantial broader impacts. A publicly available open source BBN code will be released. Moreover, new and strong links will be forged among the CMB and early-universe particle astrophysics communities, and more widely among the particle astrophysics, cosmology, and astronomy communities. Graduate students, both in formal courses in research mentoring, will be trained to synthesize these approaches and to work in an interdisciplinary way. In addition, Profs.

Kinney's research focuses on the physics of Cosmological Inflation, the leading model for the physics of the earliest moments of the universe. This research will address the questions of observational constraints on inflation, alternatives to inflation, and probes of fundamental physics. By contrast, Stojkovic will focus on building, developing, and using the very comprehensive BlackMax computer code for simulating dark matter signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, and addressing puzzles raised by recent observational data. Joint effort by the PIs is also planned in studying alternatives to inflation and addressing the puzzles raised by recent observational data. <br/><br/>The research funded by this award will also have significant broader impacts. The tools developed (such as the BlackMax software package) will be made publicly available for the benefit of a wide physics community. This project will also provide an excellent training ground for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, preparing them for future careers in scientific research. Both Kinney and Stojkovic are very active in outreach activities such as public lectures, school visits, planetarium shows, and the ongoing ""Science & Art Cabaret"" organized by Kinney in conjunction with Hallwall's Contemporary Art Center and the Buffalo Science Museum."
1.05,"The three researchers on this proposal propose a program investigating fundamental aspects of string theory and M-theory and their implications for particle phenomenology and cosmology. One aspect of this project deals with the construction and implications for phenomenology of flux backgrounds for heterotic strings, which they denote by torsional heterotic geometries. The heterotic string is a natural setting to construct models of particle phenomenology. However, the role played by background H-flux has not been unraveled yet, even though it may profoundly influence the 4d low-energy effective action. In this project the PIs employ a strategy to obtain the first large class of torsional heterotic geometries by explicitly constructing their metric. The number of torsional heterotic geometries turns out to be of the same order of magnitude as the number of type II flux backgrounds. The explicit examples display an N=2,1,0, supersymmetry in 4d. Flux changes the 4d phenomenology and the PIs are investigating the implications of this new strategy. They propose strategies to obtain chiral matter and novel ways to break the E8 gauge symmetry to the standard model gauge group. These backgrounds stand a much better chance of admitting tractable world-sheet descriptions compared to the type II counterparts. The precise implications of torsional geometries for algebraic geometry such as the calculation of the exact moduli space of torsional geometries, the resolution of singularities, the construction of vector bundles and ultimately three-generation models with stabilized moduli is proposed. Evidence of string theory from cosmology will be explored in terms of a brane inflation model. String theory models make predictions for gravitational radiation and lead to strong non-Gaussianities in the cosmic microwave background. Several aspects of the duality between M-theory compactifications to 4d space-time and its boundary conformal field theories (CFT) will also be explored. The research also includes a systematic construction and possible string/M-theory embedding of new supergravities in diverse dimensions, exploration of infinite dimensional symmetries, and their implications for integrability in string theory in nontrivial backgrounds. Finally, the important question of the uniqueness of string theory as a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity will be addressed in the context of 3d quantum gravity and its dual CFT. The broader impacts of the project are related to the importance of testing string theory as theory that can describe experiments. The PIs are looking for ways to understand the experimental tests for Cosmology and particle physics. In the LHC era and with new satellites becoming available, it is vital to work out the connections between physics at the Planck scale and TeV scale physics, while advancing our knowledge in string cosmology. The final goal of this project is to unravel the imprints of high-energy physics onto our 4d world. At the same time the program is expected to have a profound impact on different areas of mathematics. Two of the PIs have just written an important book on string theory and M theory with John Schwartz, one of the founders of superstring theory. All three PIs are involved in disseminating information about string theory by giving talks at workshops and conferences as well as organizing workshops. They are also involved in collaborations with mathematicians to understand the topology and geometry of string theory."

1.23269,"The fields of particle physics and cosmology have become inextricably intertwined. Accelerator based experiments, detectors in mines, and telescopes are all needed and used to explore fundamental questions such as the nature of dark matter. The Stanford group led by Principle Investigator Patricia Burchat will complete its investment in the highly productive BaBar experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and build a new effort in cosmology through the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. On the BaBar experiment the goal is to more than double the current data sample by the time the experiment completes its nine-year program at the end of FY2008. The Stanford group will contribute to the maintenance and operation of the SVT and the SVT radiation monitoring system. Members of the group will complete ongoing searches for new physics in rare or forbidden tau and charm decays, and a diverse set of analyses involving charmed baryons. The group is also initiating a new analysis effort involving D mixing and will conduct the final time-dependent Dalitz-plot analysis of B -> rho pi on the complete data sample, to extract the CKM angle alpha. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is the first ground-based telescope being designed from scratch to address the severe demands on systematic uncertainties needed to fully exploit weak gravitational lensing as a cosmological probe. The LSST will also address cosmological questions through studies of the growth of large scale structure, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. The Stanford group is joining the LSST project collaboration and will contribute to areas that benefit from the experience of particle physicists and aid in the understanding and reduction of potential systematic uncertainties: the development of a detailed simulation, the study of algorithms with existing data sets, and the design and construction of calibration systems. The broader impacts of the program have several foci. The PI will continue her efforts to integrate experimental particle physicists into the LSST project through tutorials and workshops. Members of the Stanford group have been very involved in programs that involve high school teachers and students (including those traditionally under-represented in physics) in basic research. The PI has led efforts to develop new undergraduate majors that increase the cohort of students who receive an education in physics."
1.32955,"PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0802575<br/>INSTITUTION: University of California ? Berkeley<br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY ? UNDERGROUND PHYSICS<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Sadoulet, Bernard<br/><br/>TITLE: Experimental Particle Cosmology<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>A broad range of observations, from galaxies and superclusters to distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation, tell us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. <br/><br/>This proposal requests the renewal of the base program of the UC Berkeley group to support their participation in the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) CDMS-II & SuperCDMS 25 kg projects. This includes (a) the completion of the CDMS-II experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the Soudan Mine in Minnesota, and (b) the testing and underground operation in the CDMS-II infrastructure at Soudan of two new SuperTowers. <br/><br/>This program will have broader impact than improving limits or detecting WIMPs. Not only are its scientific results important for astrophysics and particle physics, but its technological development will also push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, whose applications are increasingly widespread, and contribute to the development of non-dissipative readout techniques. Furthermore, they continue to support the public outreach program at Soudan, which hosts some 60,000 visitors and tens of classes each year for tours of the mine and laboratory."

0.250059,"AST-0708154/0708087<br/>Kravtsov/Gnedin<br/><br/>Understanding galaxy formation is one of the most important and challenging problems in modern cosmology. In particular, star formation is perhaps the worst understood and least developed ingredients of modern cosmological simulations. This collaborative project, led by Dr Kravtsov, aims to reduce greatly the uncertainty in the physics of galaxy formation by developing new, observationally motivated models for the formation of stars and star clusters. Recent advances in numerical algorithms and computing power mean that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations can now resolve the actual sites of star formation in the interstellar medium, making it possible to track the formation and destruction of giant molecular clouds self-consistently. The planned suite of ultra high-resolution N-body and gas dynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations will incorporate an unprecedented wealth of physical processes, including the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust and its self-shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation, and self-consistent three-dimensional continuum radiative transfer. On smaller unresolved scales, the simulations will incorporate star formation recipes based on reliable empirical correlations. The planned research will study the molecular content of high-redshift galaxies, develop star formation prescriptions consistent with the observational correlations, and study star formation in different galactic environments. It will address the formation and evolution of massive star clusters, for which abundant observational data exist, and investigate the dependence of cluster formation efficiency on properties of the host galaxy.<br/><br/>This project is unique in its ability to bridge the large scales of galaxy formation and the small scales of star formation, thus developing links between those two research communities. By involving students, the work provides professional training of young computational cosmologists in cutting-edge simulation techniques. The results provide support for current and forthcoming space- and ground-based observing programs. The research results are tightly integrated into academic teaching, and public education and outreach activities. Three-dimensional visualizations of the simulations will be available for planetarium shows and public lectures, and also web-accessible."
0.12354,"AST 0098584<br/>Weinberg<br/><br/>Over the past two decades astronomers have amassed a considerable body of evidence for the existence of an unseen component of the universe which exerts a gravitational-like influence but has no other identified signature. This component is known as ""dark matter."" One of the outstanding problems in the construction of cosmological models is our lack of knowledge of just how the dark matter is distributed with respect to the luminous matter. The spatial function which can describe this difference in distribution is referred to as ""bias"" and its determination is critical for understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. The goal of this project is to construct a series of cosmological models, using a bias model known as the ""halo occupation distribution"" (HOD) which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by giving the conditional probability p(NjM) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within virialized dark halos. These models would predict different types of galaxy clustering depending on the HOD used. The resulting predicted distributions of galaxies generated by these families of cosmological models will be compared with the observed galaxy distributions found in the upcoming surveys from Australia (the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey or ""2dFGRS"") and from the United States (the Sloan Digital Sky Survey or ""SDSS""). These comparisons may confirm the basic validity of the models and thus determine an empirical form of the HOD. Alternatively, these empirical tests may show that the current theoretical picture of galaxy formation is still missing important physical ingredients.

0.120001,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Rouzbeh Allahverdi at the University of New Mexico Department of Physics and Astronomy. <br/><br/>We know from observations that only 15% of the matter in the universe is described by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, while 85% is made of Dark Matter (DM). However, the nature and origin of DM remains as one of the most profound problems at the interface of particle physics and cosmology. The successful running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has put us on the verge of discovering new physics beyond the SM. This, combined with a whole array of direct and indirect detection experiments, will help us discover the DM and establish its particle physics origin. The complementary information provided by these experiments will also play a crucial role in shedding light on the cosmological history of the early universe. The research funded by this award will be to help establish the nature of Dark Matter by using complementary signals from different experiments, and to determine its origin. It will also study the reason for the numerical coincidence that the amount of visible matter and dark matter are not too different, and will study possible interactions between Dark Matter and neutrinos. The research funded by this award will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Allahverdi will involve graduate and undergraduate students in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field. The PI will additionally outreach his results to a broader audience by giving public lectures and visiting schools.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award has a three-fold goal. First, by using complementary signals from different experiments to determine the thermal or non-thermal origin of DM. In several extensions of the SM, the DM is produced non-thermally. Second, to investigate models that can address the baryon-DM coincidence puzzle, since in general the densities of baryons and DM can be widely different (since they are produced at very different epochs). Third, to probe possible connections between the DM and neutrinos, including possible sensitivity to the Dirac or Majorana nature of neutrinos. To achieve these objectives, Professor Allahverdi studies various particle physics models of DM in light of data from indirect detection searches, and examines their testable predictions for collider and direct detection experiments. These investigations will help determine the deeper theoretical origin of the DM sector and its embedding within a fundamental theory. They will also enable us to use DM as a window to the thermal history of the universe when it was a tiny fraction of a second old. This is far earlier than that provided by current observational probes, namely the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)."

3.644169,"There is mounting evidence that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a subnuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale at which Inflation occurred. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with the amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor-to-scalar modes, r = T/S. Many theoretically favored models of Inflation produce this ratio between 0.01 and 0.1, corresponding to average amplitude from 30 to 100 nanoKelvins for the resulting CMB B-mode polarization patterns where they peak on scales of degrees. With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and ultimately detecting the CGB polarization signature, which is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. In 2005, the Community Task Force on CMB Research identified a target sensitivity of that ratio equaling to 0.02 as an immediate goal to detect the Inflationary gravitational waves imprint in the CMB polarization that pertain to the standard cosmological model. The newly installed 'Small Polarimeter Upgrades for DASI' (SPUD) reconfigured a five- receivers telescope to the ""South Pole Inflationary Cosmology Experiment"" (SPICE) that will: (a) Complete the CGB search in CMB B-mode polarization at 150 GHz, reaching depths which based on current sensitivity performance, that will detect the Inflationary CGB for r > 0.02; (b) Prove that this signal is cosmic in origin while separately measuring the Galactic foreground contamination at its minimum; (c) Detect gravitational lensing of CMB polarization on scales of ~1 degree, probing the CGB to the lensing confusion limit for degree-scale observations (r < 0.01) if the energy scale of Inflation is low; and (d) Surpass the instrumental sensitivity goals set forth for 2013 by the 2005 CMB Task Force recommendations. Detection of the CGB waves would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang theory. Indeed, its impact may be even broader as nuclear physics had matured enough prior to the establishment of the ""hot"" Big Bang model, while Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics: the union of general relativity and quantum mechanics, string theory, and the highest accessible energies. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science and train students."

He proposes to continue to refine our understanding of the origin of the quasiclassical realm of every day experience as an emergent feature of our quantum universe. Gary Horowitz will investigate physics near cosmological singularities in holographic theories of quantum gravity. These are theories in which quantum gravitational degrees of freedom are equivalently described by a lower dimensional nongravitational theory. Horowitz will also explore connections between gravity and condensed matter that can arise using a classical limit of holography. This provides a new tool for the study of superconductivity and other phenomena. In addition, Horowitz will investigate aspects of higher dimensional black holes. Don Marolf will explore a variety of issues in classical and quantum gravity related to black holes, thermodynamics, and entropy. One is to extend arguments that black holes are thermodynamic systems to more general situations. Another is to investigate the possibility that the area of more general surfaces in spacetime might also be associated with entropy, and that spacetime itself may exist only due to thermodynamic phenomena. A final part of his work will continue to study implications of a quantum-mechanical phenomenon (the so-called Hawking effect) that causes black holes to slowly evaporate and which may require significant changes in our understanding of fundamental physics.

The aims are to develop analytical methods for describing nonlinear gravitational instability and gravitational lensing and to investigate observational consequences of these phenomena. The evolution of correlation functions and the matter distribution within virialized objects will be studied analytically and with numerical models. Local Lagrangian approximations to weakly nonlinear evolution will be further tested and applied.

0.147379,"The focus of this proposal is the study of the global nonlinear behavior of solutions to the relativistic Euler equations, which are the fundamental PDEs of relativistic fluid mechanics. In particular, the principal investigator will study the effect that spacetime expansion has on the global behavior of fluids. A primary goal is to understand the minimal expansion rate that is capable of suppressing the formation of shocks in solutions that are launched by small, smooth initial data. A related secondary goal is to find conditions on smooth initial data that guarantee the evolutionary formation of shocks. In a broader context, this work will advance our understanding of the global behavior of solutions to quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs on expanding Lorentzian manifolds. Attacking these problems requires the development and application of mathematical techniques lying at the interface of geometry, analysis, and fluid mechanics. Specifically, the principal investigator will use geometric energy methods to derive dissipative and dispersive estimates for solutions to hyperbolic PDEs.<br/><br/>The projects in this proposal are expected to help provide rigorous mathematical justification for some of the most fundamental predictions of cosmology, many of which are based on the behavior of explicit solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; in cosmology, much of the ""normal matter"" content of the universe is assumed to be effectively modeled by a fluid. It is especially important to understand the effect that spacetime expansion has on the behavior of fluids, for experimental observations indicate that our own universe is undergoing accelerated expansion. Although the physical picture of the fluid behavior set forth by the standard cosmological model is by now well-established, a full mathematical justification of its predictions has yet to emerge. In particular, in order for the explicit fluid solutions to have predictive value, it is essential to show that they are globally stable under small perturbations of their initial conditions; this is one of the major proposal goals. On the other hand, the principal investigator's investigation of shock formation may expose some limitations of the fluid model in cosmology. In addition to conducting research, the principal investigator will also supervise undergraduate research projects connected to the main themes of this proposal."
0.058364,"The series of measurements made after the initial observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation has helped transform observational cosmology into an extremely predictive science. Many of the parameters of the cosmological concordance model have now been measured and further exploration of these parameters over the next few decades are likely to reveal even more hidden aspects of our universe. Although many of the predictions from cosmology have now been realized, there are others that remain unobserved. The direct detection of the Cosmic Neutrino Background produced from the primordial Big Bang stands as one of the fundamental challenges in both neutrino physics and cosmology. Like their photon counterparts, the existence of relic neutrinos in the cosmos is expected; yet, its direct observation remains elusive. Observation of the cosmic relic neutrinos or, conversely, the absence of such, stands as an important verification of the model.<br/><br/>The direct observation of relic neutrinos is an extremely difficult challenge from an experimental perspective. The neutrino temperature, T, is related directly to the CMB temperature, and is expected to be T=1.95 K, or 0.17 meV in energy. Most conventional methods of detecting neutrinos rely on interactions that have some threshold for the energy of the incoming neutrino which is often many orders of magnitude larger than this predicted relic neutrino energy. Fortunately, there exists a good candidate by which such low energy neutrinos can be detected: neutrino capture on radioactive nuclei. The signal of the neutrino capture process is unique: a monoenergetic peak above the endpoint energy of the beta decay energy spectrum. With a detector of sufficient resolution and target mass, detection of the Cosmic Neutrino Background appears, at least in principle, to be possible. This EAGER award is for an exploratory, high-risk, high-payoff effort to build a small novel experiment to test this high precision detection technique.<br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, this project addresses a search for the direct detection of the Cosmic Neutrino Background. If successful, it will have significant overlap with particle physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. The technique envisioned for this measurement has potential ramifications for other disciplines with significant interest in low energy electron metrology."
0.105,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Brian Fields at the University of Illinois and Professor Lloyd Knox at the University of California Davis.<br/><br/>The theory of big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--in the first seconds of the big bang. BBN predictions for cosmic light-element abundances are in broad agreement with observations; this concordance is a major success of the hot big bang model. Moreover, BBN provides a measure of the ordinary matter (""baryon"") content of the universe, as well as total content in relativistic particles (""radiation"") in both visible and invisible form (e.g., neutrinos and any other forms of ""dark light""). In the past decade, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a precise and independent measure of cosmic baryons. Comparing BBN and CMB baryon measures thus has provided a new fundamental test of the hot big bang cosmology, and reveal a ""lithium problem."" This BBN/CMB connection is now poised to open qualitatively new possibilities. Recent and upcoming measurements of the CMB for the first time will simultaneously probe not only cosmic baryons, but also cosmic radiation as well as the helium abundance itself. This will enable powerful new tests of cosmology: for the first time, the predictions of BBN can be tested entirely with very precise CMB data. Agreement would dramatically demonstrate the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics. Professors Fields and Knox will both evaluate and interpret the BBN-CMB comparison, develop tools to efficiently and accurately compare BBN and CMB data. For the first time, a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach will be used to evaluate BBN uncertainties; this will allow a direct and consistent means of combining BBN predictions and CMB data and statistically characterizing the results. As part of this analysis, a new open-source BBN code will be produced, tested, and publicly released.<br/><br/>It is expected that this work will have substantial broader impacts. A publicly available open source BBN code will be released. Moreover, new and strong links will be forged among the CMB and early-universe particle astrophysics communities, and more widely among the particle astrophysics, cosmology, and astronomy communities. Graduate students, both in formal courses in research mentoring, will be trained to synthesize these approaches and to work in an interdisciplinary way. In addition, Profs. Fields will maintain vigorous, sustained outreach programs which include school visits and public lectures bringing this forefront science to a wider audience."

The chief goal is to build the foundation required to use H2CO as a unique and powerful tool to study the star formation history of the Universe, the evolution of galaxies, and the formation mechanism of hydroxyl megamasers, and to make precise measurements of cosmological parameters. Formaldehyde is a tracer of high-density gas, which is tightly correlated with star formation, so H2CO surveys will be limited by the star formation rate, independent of redshift or dust extinction. H2CO surveys are also mass limited. H2CO absorption against the CMB can likely be used as a standard ruler to measure cosmological parameters far beyond the distance limit set by galaxy clusters.<br/><br/>The research project includes building a scientific foundation for ground-breaking work with the Expanded Very Large Array (New Mexico) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Chile), training new astronomers to use these upcoming facilities, creating synergy between astrophysical and laboratory studies of molecules, and creating opportunities for new directions in education, outreach, and mentoring.

In the context of the early Universe, studies of the quantum mechanics of cosmologies and of the properties of the most general cosmological spacetimes might suggest how to overcome these intrinsic limitations of general relativity. Quantum cosmology serves as a theoretical laboratory within which to test both approaches to quantum gravity and possible quantum gravitational effects in the early Universe.

1.32,"A broad range of cosmological observations tells us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. Such particles would represent an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as supersymmetry or additional dimensions. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low-temperature phonon-mediated devices to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from backgrounds. This award will provide funds for the base program of UCB to support the scientific aspects of this program in the following ways, fully coordinated with the CDMS collaboration: (a) scientific support of the SuperCDMS Soudan experiment (monitoring of Soudan operation, characterization of detector performance, reconstruction, and analysis); (b) contribution to the design of SuperCDMS SNOLAB (proof of concept of various detector configurations, detector testing, optimization of cold hardware and electronics); and (c) scientific support to SuperCDMS SNOLAB construction (SNOLAB production detector testing and characterization, cold hardware design validation, optimization of analysis methods to maximize efficiency).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This program's technological development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, whose applications are increasingly widespread. The project will contribute to the training of undergraduates, graduates, and research scientists.

Astronomers' expectation of what will be observed at high redshifts (above 7) by future major facilities is largely based on theoretical and numerical models of the early growth of cosmic structure in a standard Lambda-CDM cosmological framework. The new simulations will span local and global scales using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technology developed specifically for petascale computers. This enables simulations with ten billion particles, a spatial dynamic range of a hundred thousand, and complex baryonic physics including radiative and chemical feedback. As theories are at present poorly constrained by observations, an equally important effort will be a rigorous attempt at uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. The study will thus address forefront questions in cosmology using the most complete physical models running on the most powerful computers, analyzed using best practices. The result will be comprehensive models of early cosmic evolution along with a rigorous assessment of their predictive value.<br/><br/>This work will substantially advance the state-of-the-art in numerical multi-physics cosmological simulations, which can be expected to continue previous successful impacts of code availability, both within and outside of the astrophysics community. The new petascale methodologies will also be publicized well outside the usual astronomy circles, and the enhanced version of the Enzo community code will be released to the public. In addition, both the numerical results and the synthetic observations will be published to the international research community using mechanisms provided by the National Virtual Observatory."

This area of physics has not been covered in recent years in India from a unified perspective. The topics to be covered include the standard models of particle physics and of cosmology; neutrino physics; fermion masses and mixings; physics beyond the standard models including (a) grand unification, (b) supersymmetry, (c) superstring phenomenology and (d) dynamical schemes on the origin of masses and families; inflation, dark matter, baryogenesis and related areas. Lecturers are from the U.S., Europe, FSU, and Asia. Students are from Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India and Nepal (BCSPIN). Fifty percent of the students will be from India. Scope: The exposure of students and young researchers to lectures by world renowned scientists greatly strengthens the scientific potential in these countries, and fosters scientific cooperation between the developing countries and the U.S. and, particularly, between India and the U.S. This school is the fourth in a series of highly successful schools that were designed to promote interest in physics research in the BCSPIN region.

A broad range of topics in particle physics such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, neutrino physics and grand unification are covered. Topics in cosmology cover the nature and origin of dark matter and dark energy and their implications for large scale structure of the universe. The unifying theme is the search for new physics that explains various puzzles of the successful standard model of particle physics and cosmology and their tests at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various ongoing non-accelerator searches for new physics such as dark matter, neutrino mixings, astrophysical anomalies and cosmic microwave background. These projects will extend the frontiers of our understanding of quark-lepton phenomena and the early Universe and may lead to discovery of new particles and forces. The research program will support graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The PIs will develop a strong program of research for high school and undergraduate students, with an emphasis on students from historically black colleges.

0.367839,"This project will apply a novel technique in gravitational lensing to the measurement of fundamental parameters related to dark energy and the acceleration of the cosmic expansion. The focus is on strong gravitational lensing by massive clusters of galaxies. In strong lensing, the gravitational bending of light by the cluster produces multiple images of background galaxies. The new aspect to be explored in this project concerns those cases where there are multiple images of multiple sources at different distances behind the cluster. Because the lens is the same, analysis of the images can permit the extraction of the lens-source geometry, from which follow constraints on the overall cosmology. Applying this technique quantitatively requires good models for the mass distributions in galaxy clusters and along the full line of sight. To this end, the Principal Investigator and a supported graduate student will perform a ray-tracing analysis through cosmological structure-formation simulations, to quantify the expected statistical and systematic errors on the recovery of cosmological parameters from simulated lens systems. They will then apply the analysis to a sample of five cluster lenses, for which Hubble Space Telescope imaging data exist, and obtain joint constraints on the cosmological matter density and the dark-energy equation of state. In addition to advising the student supported by this project, the Principal Investigator will develop and teach a seminar in scientific communication for undergraduate astronomy majors.

In particular, star formation is perhaps the worst understood and least developed ingredients of modern cosmological simulations. This collaborative project, led by Dr Kravtsov, aims to reduce greatly the uncertainty in the physics of galaxy formation by developing new, observationally motivated models for the formation of stars and star clusters. Recent advances in numerical algorithms and computing power mean that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations can now resolve the actual sites of star formation in the interstellar medium, making it possible to track the formation and destruction of giant molecular clouds self-consistently. The planned suite of ultra high-resolution N-body and gas dynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations will incorporate an unprecedented wealth of physical processes, including the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust and its self-shielding from ambient ultraviolet radiation, and self-consistent three-dimensional continuum radiative transfer. On smaller unresolved scales, the simulations will incorporate star formation recipes based on reliable empirical correlations. The planned research will study the molecular content of high-redshift galaxies, develop star formation prescriptions consistent with the observational correlations, and study star formation in different galactic environments. It will address the formation and evolution of massive star clusters, for which abundant observational data exist, and investigate the dependence of cluster formation efficiency on properties of the host galaxy.<br/><br/>This project is unique in its ability to bridge the large scales of galaxy formation and the small scales of star formation, thus developing links between those two research communities.

The project scientists plan to extend their observations to cover galaxy counts for sources in the flux range of 0.5 to 20 mJy at submillimeter wavelengths. They expect these low flux sources to comprise the bulk of the light seen in the far infrared background. They will use deep centimeter radio maps from the VLA and hi-resolution, hard x-ray images from the Chandra satellite to determine the multi-wavelength properties of these distant, heavily dust-obscured sources. This data in turn will be used to identify objects for further study with the Keck, Subaru, and Gemini telescopes.<br/><br/><br/>These studies focus on the properties of galaxies during an interval of cosmic time when most of the stars we see today were being formed. In the early stages of formation, stars are enshrouded in dust and this dust blocks visible light. However, very energetic electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays, or very low energy radiation, such as submillimeter (far infrared) or radio waves can penetrate the dust and allow us to ""see"" the stars as they form. The newly developed ""SCUBA"" detector at the 15 m JCMT in Hawaii can be used to detect very faint submillimeter sources, which may be dust enshrouded stars (starbursts) or may be active galactic nuclei (AGNs), by using intervening clusters of galaxies to ""lens"", or enhance the brightness, of the faint sources. By combining these observations with ones in the X-ray region (from the Chandra satellite) and other observations in the radio region (using the VLA) Cowie and Barger will be able to sort out the starbursts from the AGNs and determine the relative importance of the two types of activity for galaxies in the early stages of evolution.<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/><br/>***"

The PI's earlier work suggests that Ly-alpha systems are the gaseous progenitors of most normal galaxies with kinematics and ionization levels which indicate absorption in moving, presumably merging, clumps rather than smooth disks. The PI has started a numerically-intensive simulation program to examine consistency between the observations and cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>The object of this proposal is to find and observe the ancestors of typical current galaxies; i.e., protogalaxies. Current theories, (for example, cold dark matter cosmologies (CDM)), predict that most protogalaxies were much less massive than current galaxies. Thus, the starlight emitted by exceedingly distant protogalaxies is too faint to detect by conventional techniques. By contrast the surveys for neutral gas discussed in this proposal are capable of detecting low-mass objects.<br/>Since stars in current galaxies have formed out of interstellar gas for the past 10 billion years, most of the ordinary matter in protogalaxies must have been gas. We detect the gas in absorption against the bright light emitted by even more distant quasars. The principal signature of gaseous protogalaxies is strong absorption in the hydrogen Lyman - alpha line. In principle we can detect low-mass objects since the absorption strength of the gas is insensitive to variations of the mass of the protogalaxy. In this work, the PIs will use the two Keck 10 m telescopes to test predictions of CDM, studying the velocity structure of the neutral and ionized gas to determine whether gas motions are generated by rotating disks or some other mechanism. and measuring the abundance of heavy elements in order to trace chemical enrichment of galaxies over cosmic time scales. and searching for emission of starlight from galaxies associated with the absorbing gas.

The interrelated physics of neutrinos and strong interaction physics/nuclei is at the heart of current theories for the origin of the light nuclei and the baryon/lepton numbers in the early universe, the origin of the heavy nuclei in stellar collapse-based events, the dynamics of supernovae, and potentially even the dark matter/energy problems. Nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics stand at the contact point of two great current trends in science: (1) the ongoing experimentally driven revolution in neutrino physics; and (2) the startling recent advances in the capabilities of observational astronomy, especially in cosmology. This represents a tremendous opportunity for advancing both fundamental neutrino/nuclear physics and astrophysics and cosmology through their interconnection. The work supported by this project will aim at exploiting this opportunity. In fact, the PI and his graduate students over the last three funding cycles have discovered a number of these connections between fundamental weak interaction/neutrino/nuclear physics and the frontiers of astrophysics, in early universe physics, the physics of gravitational collapse, nucleosynthesis, and especially the possible connections between neutrino ?avor transformation and dynamics/nucleosynthesis. This has proven to be an excellent training ground for graduate students (7 PhD's in 9 years, all of whom have positions in nuclear physics research, and 5 have tenured or tenure track positions) and undergraduates (6 REU undergraduates). This project will enable the continuing training of excellent students. Coupled with the PI's seminars/outreach and publications, this constitutes the broader impact of this project beyond the scientific product. Arguably, the mass-squared differences and vacuum mixing angles (save for 13) of the neutrinos are now measured. A key goal of this project is to assess and calculate the impact of this new knowledge on models for the physics of the early universe, gravitational collapse, and nucleosynthesis. Some neutrino properties, like the CP-violating phase(es) and 13 remain unmeasured. A goal here will be to assess the role of these quantities in astrophysical environments with an eye toward constraints. Ultimately, the full extent of the neutrino mass and mixing spectrum, especially regarding right-handed states remains mysterious. Because the cosmological parameters (e.g., as derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotopies) and neutrino properties are so tightly constrained, a positive result in the on-going mini-BooNE experiment, for example, could signal the existence of a light SU(2) singlet 'sterile' neutrino which mixes with active species. This might also signal the existence of a large net lepton number(s) as well as call for a radical overhall of existing models for stellar collapse, heavy element nucleosynthesis, the role of neutrinos in dark matter/energy, and the origin of the baryon number. Observations of Ultra Metal Poor halo stars recently have given us new insight into the r-process which challenge existing models (e.g., the solar system abundance pattern seems to be universal for nuclear masses > 100). <br/>The PI and his students will direct analytic and numerical calculations toward: (1) an understanding of active-active and active-sterile channel neutrino flavor transformation in the early universe as regards big bang nucleosynthesis and lepton number generation/destruction/limits, CMB derived neutrino mass limits, supernova shock re-heating, r-process nucleosynthesis, the supernova neutrino signal, and all with emphasis on insight into the newly discovered fixed point solution for the nonlinear neutrino-neutrino forward scattering 'background' potential in the active-active neutrino/antimeutrino conversion channel; (2) a further study of neutrino-nucleus interactions in stellar collapse/heavy element nucleosynthesis, including de-excitation of hot nuclei into neutrino pairs and neutrino capture-induced fission, as well as a consistent treatment of the relationship between the high temperature nuclear partition function and the weak strength distribution in nuclei; (3) studies directed toward better constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter from better knowledge of the physics of the QCD epoch in the early universe, from future x-ray observatories, and from the effects of these particles in post-supernova explosion neutron stars, especially the way in which the neutrino potentials which the govern de-coherence production of these heavy states evolve with time; (4) exploring the role of dynamical neutrino mass generation in cosmology; (5) studies of high neutron excess r-process nucleosynthesis with fission cycling."
0.03441,"This award will enable Dr. Edward W. Kolb of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and other members of the Fermilab Astrophysics Group to collaborate with Prof. Katsuhiko Sato of the University of Tokyo, Japan, and other Japanese scientists over a period of two years. They will perform a systematic study of the expanding universe model and its space-time structures, including aspects of the universe's creation and evolution. The purpose of this research is to study the cosmological effects of the breaking of the natural symmetry which, it is assumed, was manifest in the very earliest stages of the existence of the universe. At high energies the laws of physics have a higher degree of symmetry than is achieved at present in nature; therefore experience gained in high-energy physics is relevant to this research. This experience of the Fermilab researchers and their Japanese co-workers will be applied to theoretical studies of dynamical systems with extra dimensions, which may describe the universe in its early stages; of cosmic strings, and their influence on the creation of particles; of anisotropic universes and quantum cosmology; of quark-hadron transitions in the early universe; and of the failure of conservation of baryon numbers. Close U.S.-Japanese cooperation made possible in this program will facilitate the completion of many of these projects, which are too comprehensive to be tackled by any single group."
0.047764,"Prof. Anderson is going to work on several projects studying quantum effects as they relate to both black holes and cosmology. For black holes he will study the question of how quantum fields alter the temperatures and entropies of black holes, as well as what happens at the end ofthe black hole evaporation process. In cosmology he will investigate whether quantum effects can cause a very rapidly expanding universe to become unstable and expand in a different way than it otherwise would, as well as study particle production in the universe after it underwent an extremely rapid period of expansion called inflation early in its history.<br/><br/>By studying the details of how quantum fields affect black holes one can address such questions as what is left after a black hole finishes evaporating and is there any new physics that is required to describe the evaporation process. By studying particle production in the early universe one can investigate exactly how the matter and radiation in the universe were created."

Astronomers' expectation of what will be observed at high redshifts (above 7) by future major facilities is largely based on theoretical and numerical models of the early growth of cosmic structure in a standard Lambda-CDM cosmological framework. The new simulations will span local and global scales using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technology developed specifically for petascale computers. This enables simulations with ten billion particles, a spatial dynamic range of a hundred thousand, and complex baryonic physics including radiative and chemical feedback. As theories are at present poorly constrained by observations, an equally important effort will be a rigorous attempt at uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. The study will thus address forefront questions in cosmology using the most complete physical models running on the most powerful computers, analyzed using best practices. The result will be comprehensive models of early cosmic evolution along with a rigorous assessment of their predictive value.<br/><br/>This work will substantially advance the state-of-the-art in numerical multi-physics cosmological simulations, which can be expected to continue previous successful impacts of code availability, both within and outside of the astrophysics community. The new petascale methodologies will also be publicized well outside the usual astronomy circles, and the enhanced version of the Enzo community code will be released to the public. In addition, both the numerical results and the synthetic observations will be published to the international research community using mechanisms provided by the National Virtual Observatory."

Clusters provide efficient tracers of the large-scale structure of the universe, and have placed some of the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters. Systematic studies of clusters are currently limited by the lack of large area, accurate, complete, and objectively selected catalogs of optical clusters: this research will use the comprehensive Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to improve this situation. The resultant well-calibrated catalog will be the largest of its kind by an order of magnitude, and will be made generally available. It will then be used to study the cluster mass function and its evolution, and the richness-dependent cluster correlation function and its evolution.<br/><br/>This project provides exceptional educational and outreach opportunities: not only will the work be carried out mostly with graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows, with a significant fraction being female, but the catalog will be made easily available.

These include possible explanations for why gravitational interactions are so much weaker than other particle interactions (like electromagnetism), and perhaps even new directions toward understanding the cosmological constant problem pointed out by Einstein.

0.09,"This project extends and continues previous work on the behavior of photons and neutrinos in a medium. Concrete calculations to be performed include: (1) The effects of the presence of a magnetic field on neutrino damping rates due to the effects of the matter-induced electromagnetic couplings of the neutrino. These effect, independent of neutrino mixing, could provide a mechanism for pulsar kicks; (2) The imaginary part of the photon self-energy (from which the photon damping rate is determined)in a medium that contains, besides the usual background of charged particles, a background of neutrinos that moves, as a whole, relative to the stationary background. This type of system has been considered in connection with energy generation mechanisms in supernova explosions; (3) The photon self-energy in a medium with an external plane wave field to study chirality effects. This is a novel application of thermal field theory methods in the context of optical and condensed matter physics.<br/><br/>The properties of photons and neutrinos in a medium, and their interactions, have been the subjects of continuous attention over the years because of they provide information about underlying processes in the environments in which they occur. This information can be important in various astrophysical and cosmological situations and in condensed matter and physical optics laboratory experiments. Apart from the details that are specific to the particular calculations and physical contexts of the calculations in this project, the treatment of these problems involve ideas, methods and techniques that can be useful in other branches of physics."
0.5,"The work proposed here is aimed at a deeper understanding of the basic laws and forces of nature. It is based on string theory and Supersymmetric Gauge Theories. These are theoretical models which combine quantum mechanics and gravity with the other forces of nature in a unified framework. Although lots of progress has been made in connecting String Theories and Supersymmetric Gauge theories to the Standard Model of Strong, Electromagnetic and Weak Interactions, as well as to big bang cosmology, new insights will be needed to make this connection stronger so that String Theory and Supersymmetry can be tested in the laboratory and observatory. This proposal is to foster serious international collaborations between the very strong string theory group at the University of Chicago, with some of the premier groups in Europe, Israel, and India. The subjects that will be investigated are at the very forefront of ideas on how to better understand Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and relate them to the Standard Model. Also of great importance is understanding Black Hole Entropy and how big-bang cosmology can emerge from string theory and brane-world physics. The PI's and collaborators have been leaders in the past few years in making progress in these areas, and by improving the mechanism for international collaboration that this grant will provide, one can expect an increase in the progress in these very important areas. The international collaboration will lead to new ways of looking at the problems confronting String Theory by having diverse talents and perspectives taking a fresh look at the issues. American Students and Post-Docs will benefit in being in diverse research and cultural environments and will benefit from being exposed to these interactions and environments. The collaboration will involve not only culturally different points of view, but also involve public lectures of the International collaborators at their partner institutions"

New experimental results offer invaluable prospects for identifying the astrophysical objects responsible for the production of high energy particles, for testing and studying models of these sources, and for studying fundamental neutrino properties.<br/>The PIs propose a theoretical study of some of the major open questions, in the context of new experimental data that are, or will soon be, available. They will focus on the sub-TeV and higher photon and neutrino emission by hadronic and electromagnetic interactions in astrophysical sources. They will use both semi- analytical methods and, where appropriate, Monte Carlo simulations. This research will consist of a theoretical study of high energy sources and a study of the constraints provided by neutrino flavor measurements on fundamental neutrino properties and on models of astrophysical sources. The broader impacts of this research are that the scientific results are expected to be useful to the high energy astrophysics, the high-redshift cosmology and the neutrino physics communities.

They will also benefit students, with whom these developments will be shared in classrooms and research projects. The research will also provide exciting material for public presentations."
0.015,"One of the greatest challenges of modern cosmology and particle physics is to <br/>explain the origin of matter in the Universe. How did the matter that makes galaxies, <br/>stars, and ultimately living beings originate in the primeval fireball described by the <br/>Big Bang model? Once the ingredients are there the leptons, quarks, and gauge <br/>fields comprising the Standard Model of particle physics Big Bang cosmology <br/>is very successful at explaining the formation of the first light nuclei and atoms. <br/>The challenge lies in understanding the mechanisms responsible for generating the <br/>particles of the Standard Model themselves: their origin and the ubiquitous excess <br/>of matter over antimatter. <br/>Observations firmly support the notion that the early Universe underwent a short <br/>period of superluminal (exponential) expansion known as inflation. The origin of <br/>matter is traced to the end of this inflationary era, when the primordial field that <br/>drives inflation transfers its energy into matter fields. This transfer is dramatic: it <br/>effectively models the hot Big Bang and is believed to have occurred in at least <br/>two phases, known as preheating and reheating. The goal of this proposal is to address both the origin of matter and its excess over antimatter as inflation transitions into the hot Big Bang model. The PI plans to analyze in detail the nonperturbative dynamics of the preheating and reheating stages for a variety of models, using analytical and numerical <br/>techniques of nonequilibrium field theory. Based on this analysis, the PI hopes to propose <br/>several observational consequences of pre/reheating for different models, including: <br/>the number of e-folds or efficacy of the inflationary phase; the generation of net <br/>baryon number; and the production of a stochastic background of gravitational <br/>waves."

0.074997,"Cosmological observations using of a variety of different techniques have provided consistent measurements of the density of mass and energy in our Universe. These observations support a model of the universe in which the present amount of nucleons (or baryons) accounted for is only a fraction of the total amount of nucleons, the nucleons are only a part of the total amount of matter, and matter is only a part of the total mass-energy of the universe, most of it being in a mysterious form. Where are the missing nucleons? What is the non-baryonic matter? What constitutes the rest of the energy? These questions are the so-called dark matter and dark energy problems. The identification of dark matter and the understanding of dark energy are among the major open questions in physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The research outlined in this proposal addresses theoretical and phenomenological aspects of these two problems using several tools: finding new models to explain the nature of the dark energy and ways to discriminate among them, studying the prospects of detecting non-baryonic dark matter in the light of recent astrophysical progress in the theory of galaxy formation, examining the formation of high concentrations of dark matter around galactic black holes, and using gravitational microlensing of unresolved stars to search for compact baryonic objects in nearby galaxies. The dark matter and dark energy problems provide abundant educational opportunities outside the traditional university setting. First, cosmology has always been of great appeal to the general public. Second, the research outlined in this proposal will use results from the largest galaxy surveys and will deal with modelsof black holes. Both topics can be used to produce attractive but scientifically sound visualizations of our location in the Universe and of a journey into a black hole, respectively. Such visualizations will then be in planetariums."

0.116999,"The research under this award investigates connections between geometry <br/>and the mathematical theory of shock waves. This includes a continuation <br/>of the authors' recent work on developing a mathematical theory of <br/>shock-waves that applies to the Einstein equations - the equations <br/>that describe the time evolution of spacetime curvature, the gravitational <br/>field according to general relativity. Shock waves are relevent here <br/>because the compressible Euler equations appear as a subsystem of the <br/>Einstein equations, and emerge exactly in the limit of low velocities <br/>and weak gravitational fields. The work includes the construction of a <br/>new cosmological model in which the expansion of the universe, <br/>(as measured by the Hubble constant), is modeled as the effect of a great <br/>explosion that generates a shock wave at the leading edge, something <br/>like a nuclear explosion into a static background, except on an enormous scale, <br/>instead of by the standard cosmological model in which it is assumed <br/>that the entire universe is expanding at a rate measured by the Hubble law. <br/>If successful, the results will provide the first and simplest model for <br/>cosmology under the assumption that the Hubble constant measures only a <br/>localized expansion, and consistent with the energy density and background <br/>radiation levels observed in the universe today. This research also has an <br/>interesting philosophical implication in that, if there were a shock wave present <br/>from the Big Bang, then, in contrast to the standard model of cosmology, <br/>there would be an associated loss of information that would make it <br/>impossible to reconstruct the details of the initial event from <br/>present data. In addition, a covariant version of Glimm's Method will be developed <br/>in an attempt to provide the first general existence theory of shock wave <br/>interactions for the Einstein equations. This is a step toward developing <br/>principles that can be applied to the numerical simulation of shock waves <br/>in general relativity. These studies will also have implications for <br/>classical fluids because the Einstein equations provide a unique setting in <br/>which natural geometrical constructs put a handle on the <br/>fluid dynamics. This work dovetails with ongoing research <br/>into how the large time behavior of shock wave solutions is related to the <br/>geometry of the Lie Algebra that gives the scattering picture for<br/>shock wave interactions. Thus this research connects the theory of <br/>shock waves and geometry on several levels. <br/><br/>Einstein's equations of general relativity describe the large scale development<br/>of the universe. Although they were first proposed more than eighty years ago,<br/>they still pose formidable mathematical challenges. This research will continue <br/>earlier work in which exact shock wave solutions of these equations were found.<br/>A mathematical theory will be developed that leads to alternatives of the standard<br/>""Big Bang"" theory and that allows a general theoretical treatment of shock waves <br/>within the general theory of relativity.

Mathematical models of such fluid flow involve highly nonlinear differential equations that have solutions with very singular structure, which is difficult to analyze. For large amplitude or highly oscillatory solutions that generate shock waves, there is no general mathematical theory that applies, and many fundamental problems remain unsolved.

0.133058,"Old stellar populations in galaxies will be studied and used as cosmological probes. The work falls logically into two areas: the study of old stellar populations and integrated spectra per se and the use of old stellar populations, specifically elliptical (E) and spherical (SO) galaxies, as tracers of irregularities in the local Hubble expansion of the universe. In the latter work, a project using E galaxies that has given evidence of a bulk motion at 600-700 km s-1 with respect to the cosmic restframe of a large sphere of galaxies around us out to 6000 km s-1 in radius will be expanded. This motion of the galaxies could provide a powerful constraint on cosmological theories and needs to be tested and probed in every possible way. To this end, a comprehensive analysis of N-body universe models as a means to illuminate potential pitfalls in Hubble flow studies of this type will be carried out. Completely new and independent estimates of the motions of nearby SO galaxies will be obtained to compare with those of Es. In the area of old stellar populations, a project will be continued to determine the metallicities and element abundance ratios in E galaxies and globular clusters. An empirical calibration of absorption-line features in G dwarf and K giant stars versus temperature, abundance, and surface gravity will be completed. These results will be compared to theoretical synthetic spectra, and, when a satisfactory understanding of stellar spectra is achieved, there will be a synthesizing of integrated spectra of galaxies.

0.2,"AST 0205944<br/>Primack<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to improve the understanding of key issues in galaxy formation and evolution, especially the origin of the structure of dark matter halos and the evolution of their baryonic contents. It will address the questions that have arisen concerning cold dark matter (CDM) type models by developing analytic and semi-analytic treatments based on, and tested against, high-resolution simulations. These will provide detailed predictions of galaxy properties at both high and low redshifts, to be compared to space and ground based data especially from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP) program. These simulations feature use of the Adaptive Refinement Tree (ART) technique, which adjusts the resolution automatically to follow particles in dense regions, and can now use particles of different masses to improve mass and force resolution. This permits the identification of all dark matter halos that can harbor bright galaxies. In addition the project will use a second tool, Semi-Analytic Merging (SAM) to model the outcomes of various star formation and feedback scenarios in CDM galaxy formation. These SAM models will be used to study the structural and chemical evolution of galaxies, including gas cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, satellite merging, and the effects of dust. They model dust emission, and allow the prediction of galaxy counts and integrated backgrounds over wavelengths from the far-UV to the sub-mm. These predictions will be invaluable for interpreting data from previous and planned space missions such as COBE, SIRTF, GALEX, etc. The computer codes for the ART and SAM models will be made available to the public.<br/>.***"
0.497038,"AST-9984924<br/>CONNOLLY<br/>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the next decade will mark the beginning of a golden age for observational cosmology. Technological advances have now made it feasible to map the properties and distributions of galaxies in the local and distant Universe with unprecedented detail. New astronomical surveys are underway, or nearing completion, that will produce images and spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of objects each with measurements covering the full electromagnetic spectrum (from X-ray wavelengths through to radio frequencies). In the near future we will no longer be restricted to applying for telescope time at national or private facilities. Instead, people will be able to ""dial-up"" a region of the sky (a virtual observatory is becoming a reality). This new paradigm for undertaking research will have profound implications for research at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. <br/><br/>One of the fundamental questions to be addressed with these new multi-frequency surveys is how do galaxies evolve as a function of redshift or lookback time. Extant photometric and spectroscopic surveys provide a framework for this evolution, finding a rapid increase in the total star formation rate from a redshift of z = 0 to redshift z = 1 (a factor of 10 increase in luminosity). The limitation of these surveys is that they extend over very small regions of the sky (for instance the deepest image ever undertaken, the Hubble Deep Field, subtends only 2 arcminutes on a side) and comprise only a few hundred galaxies. Consequently, we do not have the numbers of galaxies to identify anything more than the broad features of galaxy evolution (i.e. our analyses are shot noise limited) nor do we survey sufficient volume to be able to say whether we are seeing a true reflection of how the Universe evolves (i.e. we are sample variance limited).<br/><br/>Many of these issues will be resolved by the new multicolor sky surveys. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey alone will contain > 108 galaxies and cover a huge volume of the sky. For the first time, there will be access to large, statistically complete samples of galaxies that can provide an accurate census of the local and distant Universe. Through the use of novel statistical techniques we can use the multicolor information within these surveys to estimate the physical properties of galaxies (i.e. their redshifts, spectral types and luminosities). From this we can then directly trace how galaxies change as a function of redshift, galaxy type and environment and thereby guide the theories of galaxy formation and evolution.<br/><br/>Beyond the insights into the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, these data will open new avenues for introducing students into the astrophysical sciences. These multifrequency surveys can be combined to form a digital sky; a database of stars and galaxies covering a large fraction of the night sky that is accessible to undergraduate and graduate students alike. Students will, in essence, have access to their own telescope and can explore or analyze the data at their own pace. Given the enormous research and teaching potential of these new sky surveys, a program of research and education designed to build the graduate and undergraduate astrophysics programs at the University of Pittsburgh will be carried out. The principle goals of these programs are:<br/><br/>o To quantify how the properties of galaxies (their spectral types, star formation and luminosities) evolve from a redshift of z = 0 to z = I and to determine what physical processes drive these changes.<br/><br/>o To trace the clustering of galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts (z < 1) as a function of lookback time, galaxy type and environment and to relate these observations to current cosmological theories of galaxy formation and evolution.<br/><br/>o To develop the new virtual observatories into an undergraduate and graduate research and teaching environment (a ""virtual telescope""). One that enables students to undertake exploration of online astrophysical databases at their own pace.<br/><br/>o To integrate computational sciences into astrophysics to enable a cross-fertilization of ideas and tech-niques at the graduate and undergraduate level.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences.<br/><br/>***"
1.192518,"Debate surrounding resource use and conservation by indigenous peoples has shifted away from tests of the ""noble savage"" hypothesis of the 1970s and 1980s towards analysis of the multiple social, economic, and biological factors that affect the sustainability of resource use. Hunting practices in particular among many indigenous groups are probably strongly regulated by internal controls, based on a combination of spiritual beliefs (cosmology), social rituals, and natural history knowledge. Despite the evidence for the key role of cosmology in regulating resource use, most work on game overexploitation and the abandonment of traditional hunting practices by indigenous peoples, particularly in the Neotropics of Central America and northern South America, has focused on the effects of market integration and ignored spiritual and other cultural practices. This research project will test the fundamental hypothesis that retention of traditional practices and cosmology by indigenous societies buffers them against the process of integration into the national society, thereby preventing biodiversity and ecosystem degradation by the indigenous societies themselves. This hypothesis will be evaluated by quantifying resource-use practices and biodiversity status among communities of one ethnic group that differ in their degree of retention of traditional cosmology and practices. The project will be based in the 1.7 million-hectare Raposa Indigenous Area in the northern Brazilian Amazon. The dynamics of hunting by the Macuxi people of this region offer an excellent system for bridging theory and practice in the study of complexity. Hunting practices and degree of integration to Brazilian society vary among 206 villages distributed across the heterogeneous landscape in Raposa. A mechanistic model of animal population dynamics and human hunting practices will be developed and tested using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Socioeconomic data, wildlife data, and remotely sensed data will be collected, integrated, and analyzed within a geographic information system. In addition to a better understanding of human-biodiversity linkages in indigenous areas, outcomes of this project will include (1) educational materials for the Macuxi and the institutions that work with them, (2) a distance-linked graduate seminar in which students collaborate across departments, campuses and disciplines, (3) broadening of the participation of women and minority students in science, and (4) enhancement of the infrastructure for science by linking institutions with different areas of specialty into a teaching and research network that will benefit students who would normally have access only to their own institution.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the development of effective development policies and biodiversity conservation and will help provide theoretical background for coupled human-natural systems in the subsistence or semi-subsistence societies that characterize much of tropics. Research results will be relevant to discussions on the role of overkill by low technology hunters in Pleistocene extinctions and the synergistic effects of environmental conditions and forms of social organization and decision making on the intensity of natural resource depletion. The results will be particularly germane for the ongoing debate on the role of ""people in parks"" and on the contribution that indigenous peoples will make to biodiversity conservation worldwide. The geographical location of this study is significant unto itself. Roraima covers a large portion of the unstudied and largely unmanaged high diversity Guiana Shield forest-savanna transition. The area, which grades from dry savannas through mesic and wet forests to montane cloud forest and tepui habitats, represents one of the last wilderness areas on Earth. For this key ecological area, the future of biodiversity lies in the hands of indigenous peoples. This study will provide key insights regarding how the internal cultural dynamics of indigenous societies influence and are influenced by biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, with implications for human-environment interactions in Raposa and elsewhere where indigenous peoples retain an important presence. This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2005 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems."

Telescopes operating at radio wavelengths at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) will be utilized, including the NRAO 140-foot telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia and the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico. The results obtained will be used to launch more ambitious radio observing campaigns to further the same goals. This research is comprised of two components. In the first component, radio-loud active galaxies which have ""inverted spectra"" (i.e., are brighter at higher radio frequency than lower radio frequency) have been selected from the VLA Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey and the Green Bank six centimeter (GB6) radio catalogs. These inverted-spectrum radio sources may be a small part of a class of radio sources that have been difficult to detect up to this date. Existing radio source catalogs are biased against the detection of inverted spectrum radio sources since they are faintest at the radio frequencies used for observations to compile existing catalogs (4.8 GHz in frequency and lower). However, models of radio-loud active galaxies predict inverted-spectrum radio sources as the precursors to other classes of radio sources (e.g., flat-spectrum radio sources). Inverted-spectrum radio sources can be brightest at frequencies well above 4.8 GHz, even above 20 GHz. A class of extra-galactic radio sources that is brightest above 20 GHz would be a significant foreground contamination to cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements such as will be made by NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), which is scheduled to be launched in 2001.<br/><br/>The data obtained at the NRAO 140-foot telescope and other facilities will be used to place upper limits on foreground contamination of the CMB anisotropy and to study the evolution of inverted-spectrum radio sources into other classes of radio-loud active galaxies. Ultimately, these data will be used to devise optimal strategies for radio surveys of the sky in the frequency range from 15 GHz to 43 GHz. Surveys of the radio ""sky"" at these frequencies are the best method for obtaining data for detecting inverted-spectrum radio sources.<br/><br/>The second component of this research project is a study of the gaseous environments of powerful extended radio sources. The environments of powerful extended radio sources appear to be gas-rich clusters of galaxies. These radio sources are detected farther, both in space and time, than galaxy clusters that are detected in the visible light or X-ray wavelengths. Thus, environments surrounding powerful extended radio sources can be used to probe cluster evolution father back in time than clusters detected by other methods.<br/><br/>A method to measure the properties of the gas in a cluster utilizes the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (S-Z) effect. Radio sources with a predicted S-Z signal from their environments greater than the radio emission from the active galaxy itself will be selected from the Third Cambridge Revised Catalog (3CR) sample of powerful extended radio sources. Radio maps at frequencies up to 43 GHz will be collected and used to compute the radio signal above 100 GHz from the active galaxy. These radio maps will be obtained from the VLA archives and the remainder will be obtained by observations at the VLA. The S-Z signal will be computed on the basis of the interaction of the radio source with the surrounding gas. A target list for observations of the S-Z effect will be determined from these data."
0.0126,"This award supports a program of theoretical research at the interface of gravitation, elementary particle theory, and cosmology. Projects include the study of ""Galileon"" models of the dark energy that appears to drive the acceleration of the universe, the use of cosmological topological gravity as a theoretical laboratory for quantum gravity, the development of a well behaved theory of quantum gravity but with only two spatial dimensions that might have implications for more realistic theories, and generalization of the Bel-Robinson tensor from general relativity to other theories of gravity.<br/><br/>The enormous improvements in recent years in the ability to measure the properties of nature from the largest to the smallest scales has raised questions and challenges for theoretical physics. Two major examples are to understand the dark matter and dark energy that appear to form 96% of today's universe and to reconcile Einstein's theory of general relativity that appears to describe gravity for the macroscopic world with the principles of quantum mechanics that appear to rule the microscopic world of atoms and elementary particles. This research program expects to have implications for both these questions. The PI plans to continue to write a series of pedagogical articles on these topics."
0.136578,"New experiments at Brookhaven and CERN will probe matter at high temperatures and densities, achieved only during the very early stages of evolution of the Universe. The next generation of Astrophysical experiments will also offer a glimpse of the Physics of the Early Universe through the imprint left by the physical processes as anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Particle Physics predicts that several phase transitions have occurred during the very Early Universe that are responsible for these anisotropies. My project is to develop and implement the tools of non-equilibrium quantum physics to provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics of these phase transitions. The goal is to be able to recognize and quantify their Cosmological consequences and their experimental signatures and to compare predictions from theories to the experimental data that will become available through these new experiments. It has been recognized that only a consistent study away from equilibrium can address effectively the Physics of the extreme environments that has taken place in the Early Universe."

0.252,"9971127<br/><br/>This proposal focuses on two major areas in spatial statistics: inference for point processes and prediction and inference for Gaussian random fields. The work in point processes is largely motivated by questions arising in the analysis of an important cosmological catalog of locations along the lines-of-sight between quasars and the Earth of what are known as heavy-element absorbers. This catalog provides a means for assessing the clustering of matter in the universe over very large spatial scales and for describing changes in this clustering as the universe has evolved. The absorber catalog can be most simply modeled as a collection of realizations of a point process observed on a large number of intervals. The fact that the process is observed over many regions rather than one large contiguous region produces some interesting opportunities and challenges for estimating properties of the point process and obtaining valid standard errors for the estimates. For example, one can use resampling methods with the regions as sampling units to obtain confidence statements, although the problem is rather difficult if, as in the absorber catalog, the regions are of different sizes. The proposed work on Gaussian random fields addresses several problems related to prediction when the covariance structure of the random field is partially unknown. Under the natural asymptotic regime of an increasing number of observations in a fixed and bounded domain, only in some very simple cases is it presently possible to prove that predictions based on an estimated covariance structure are asymptotically optimal. Recent work by Putter and Young provide a promising approach for proving such results. This proposal also addresses the design of observation networks for prediction when the covariance structure is unknown. For prediction, the local behavior of the random field is critical and practical experience has demonstrated that evenly spaced observations are poor designs when trying to infer this local behavior. This proposal aims to provide theoretical support to this empirical finding. For example, preliminary work shows that there is tremendous potential for improving the estimation of the fractal dimension of a Gaussian process by taking observations on two grids of very different spacing rather than on a single evenly spaced grid.<br/><br/>Spatial statistics is a rapidly growing area of inquiry with broad applicability to the natural and social sciences. Despite its present widespread usage, the theoretical properties of many commonly applied procedures in spatial statistics are poorly understood. The first major topic of this proposal is the analysis of data made up of locations in space. This work is motivated by a cosmological data set that provides important information about the large-scale structure of the universe. Estimating this large-scale structure is a critical component in resolving the fundamental cosmological problem of how the universe evolved from its nearly uniform early state to its present highly clumped state. In addition to the direct application the proposed work has to cosmology, the problems addressed also occur naturally in microscopy. The second major topic in this proposal is the prediction of quantities such as temperature, pollution concentrations and soil characteristics whose levels vary randomly across space. Two specific problems include studying the properties of such predictions when there is uncertainty about how the values of this quantity fluctuate in space and selecting the locations of observations to yield accurate predictions. Spatial prediction is widely used in the atmospheric sciences, pollution monitoring, hydrology and mining."
0.200112,"AST-0084847<br/>Barger, Amy J. <br/><br/>Submillimeter Studies of the Cosmological Star Formation and AGN Histories<br/><br/>This work has as its goal the analysis of new information about the dust-obscured star formation and AGN activity at high-redshifts which was recently discovered with the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the 15 m James Clark Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii. The project scientists plan to extend their observations to cover galaxy counts for sources in the flux range of 0.5 to 20 mJy at submillimeter wavelengths. They expect these low flux sources to comprise the bulk of the light seen in the far infrared background. They will use deep centimeter radio maps from the VLA and hi-resolution, hard x-ray images from the Chandra satellite to determine the multi-wavelength properties of these distant, heavily dust-obscured sources. This data in turn will be used to identify objects for further study with the Keck, Subaru, and Gemini telescopes.<br/><br/>These studies focus on the properties of galaxies during an interval of cosmic time when most of the stars we see today were being formed. In the early stages of formation, stars are enshrouded in dust and this dust blocks visible light. However, very energetic electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays, or very low energy radiation, such as submillimeter (far infrared) or radio waves can penetrate the dust and allow us to ""see"" the stars as they form. The newly developed ""SCUBA"" detector at the 15 m JCMT in Hawaii can be used to detect very faint submillimeter sources, which may be dust enshrouded stars (starbursts) or may be active galactic nuclei (AGNs), by using intervening clusters of galaxies to ""lens"", or enhance the brightness, of the faint sources. By combining these observations with ones in the X-ray region (from the Chandra satellite) and other observations in the radio region (using the VLA) Cowie and Barger will be able to sort out the starbursts from the AGNs and determine the relative importance of the two types of activity for galaxies in the early stages of evolution.<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/><br/>***"

0.050047,"This collaborative project will bring to light an overlooked astronomical controversy of previously unsuspected importance for the interpretation of the Copernican revolution. Johannes Regiomontanus was the leading mathematical astronomer of the fifteenth century; his critical analysis of Ptolemy's `Almagest` provided an important stimulus for Copernicus's development of his sun-centered model of the solar system. Regiomontanus's `Defense of Theon against George of Trebizond` is a very rich but completely unstudied 573-page attack on Trebizond's presentation of the `Almagest,` the work that Copernicus would eclipse. This work of Regiomontanus's illuminates the most important known clue about the emergence of Copernicus's cosmology, for it fleshes out Regiomontanus's reasoning in proposing the alternative models that Copernicus would later use. In this collaborative project the PIs will transcribe and analyze Regiomontanus's lengthy text, present their most important results in four preliminary articles, and begin the monograph they will write about this astronomical controversy and its significance in the history of cosmology.

Dr. Swanson will research the mysteries of dark energy and neutrino mass using the upcoming galaxy surveys of the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Differences in fundamental physics lead to changes in the large-scale clustering of matter, so one can use the universe as a particle physics laboratory by measuring this clustering with surveys cataloging large numbers of galaxies. However, galaxy formation physics also impacts the clustering, which leads to systematic uncertainties in measuring dark energy and neutrino properties. This project will develop a detailed understanding of these uncertainties and apply them to the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. The methods used will be as follows: first, build theoretical models encoding galaxy formation physics and test them by comparing to current surveys and simulations. Next, use these models to compute the uncertainties expected from future galaxy surveys. Finally, develop analysis methods to apply to future survey data that will optimize the physics results. The primary objective is an analytical framework to account for galaxy formation physics when extracting information about dark energy and neutrinos from survey data.<br/><br/>Dr. Swanson will also develop and teach an enrichment course in cosmology for Boston area high-school students through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Educational Studies Program. She will collaborate with the CfA Science Education Department to develop and assess the curriculum for the course, which will focus on helping students break down commonly-held misconceptions about astonomy and cosmology using inquiry-based techniques, observational projects using the MicroObservatory online telescopes, and computer simulations and visualizations.

0.005,"9988661<br/>Kubodera<br/> Interconnection between microscopic physics and astrophysical phenomena is one of the most fascinating aspects of nature. In particular, we now know that neutrinos play a key role in many areas of particle physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. The recent discovery of neutrino oscillation gives the first exciting hint of new physics beyond the standard model. It is clearly extremely important to further study the oscillation and other fundamental properties of neutrinos. It is also important to improve our knowledge of neutrinos-nucleus reactions, which are crucial for understanding stellar collapse and the origin of chemical elements. These and many other interesting questions can be investigated at stopped pion neutrino facilities like the planned spallation neutron source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The SNS offers a unique opportunity to build a large neutrino detectors that are ideally suited for neutrino oscillation measurements and studying neutrino-nucleus reactions. It is clearly desirable to place this project in the broad context of the current status of neutrino physics in general and its relation to astrophysics and cosmology. We therefore wish to organize a three-day symposium entitled Carolina Symposium on Neutrino Physics (CSNP), with two main goals: (1) To explore and exchange ideas on the latest developments in general frontiers of neutrino physics, both experimental and theoretical; (2) To address specific issues pertaining to the above-mentioned stopped-pion neutrino facility. We request the NSF to partially support CSNP with a grant belonging to the category: ``Conferences, Symposia and Workshops"".

0.943696,"Semiclassical quantum gravity is a bridge between the classical theory of Einstein and a full quantum theory of gravity whose exact nature is not yet known. It therefore applies to phenomena that are both close to the classical theory of gravity, but have implications for the search for a quantum theory of gravity. Several investigations into semiclassical quantum gravity will be carried out. These include an investigation into the pair production of charged black holes. Investigations into the nature of the full theory of quantum gravity will also be carried out. A problem of particular importance is the status in quantum gravity of the singularities which limit the predictive power of the classical theory. This will be investigated using the techniques of string theory. The objective is to establish whether singularities are smoothed out or removed at this fundamental level. A central issue of modern cosmology is the problem of providing a theory of the initial condition of the universe which will make testable predictions for observations today. Since gravitation is the dominant force governing the structure of the universe on the largest scales of space and time, and since the early universe is likely to be quantum mechanical in an essential way, the search for this initial condition is carried out in that branch of quantum gravity called quantum cosmology. A broad based research program will be carried out into the nature of this initial condition, the generalizations of quantum mechanics which may be needed for its interpretation, and the models which allow for comparison of its predictions with observations. The objective of this research is to encapsulate the simplicity of the early universe as revealed by observation, together with the features which arise out of this simplicity, in one physical law."

0.1,"Recent observations have been able to detect remnants of physical processes that occurred a tiny fraction of second after the so-called big bang. On the theoretical side our understanding of the cosmic evolution although quite sophisticated is still incomplete. A deep understanding of how to make Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics consistent is needed to describe the very early universe, and such a theory is not fully developed yet. This project seeks to contribute to filling this gap by incorporating ideas and techniques of quantum gravity to cosmology with the goal of overcoming limitations of current models. The objective of this project is therefore twofold: to extend our understanding of the origin and fate of the universe, and to confront new quantum-gravity ideas with the last generation of observations.<br/><br/>The proposed research aims at developing approximate methods to incorporate quantum gravity physics in models of the early universe. Investigations will focus on theoretical as well as phenomenological aspects of quantum cosmology, with special emphasis on techniques coming from loop quantum gravity. From the theoretical point of view, it will be explored how matter fields propagate on regimes in which the quantum aspects of gravity are important, and the way in which the familiar quantum field theory in curved space-times emerges from the more fundamental theory. From the phenomenological viewpoint, the resulting theoretical framework will be applied to extend cosmological models to include Planck scale physics. Investigations will cover scalar perturbations that are responsible for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy distribution, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, and particular attention will be paid to gravitational waves generated in the early universe."
0.18,"This is a particularly ripe time for research at the boundary between particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology. This is due, in large part, to the fact that data is soon expected to emerge from a plethora of experiments in both particle physics and astrophysics.

Indeed, in many instances these different experiments are complementary to each other, each providing a different window into the as-yet-unexplored physics beyond the Standard Model. In this proposal, Professor Tait aims to explore new theories for physics at the electroweak scale which sit at this interface between particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. His goal is to understand new phenomena which may be manifest at these experiments, provide theoretical descriptions of phenomena as they are discovered, and eventually fit them into a larger theoretical framework.

He will also compile a set of lecture notes which will be regularly updated, and include topics in the areas of collider physics and dark matter. These notes should provide an important resource for graduate students (or even postdocs and interested faculty in other subfields) in these rapidly evolving fields.

Today's scientific understanding of those beginnings still leaves many unanswered questions: Why is the geometry of the universe so flat? Why is the universe so homogeneous? Theoretical cosmologists have posed answers to these questions, but the theories are extremely difficult to verify. Inflation in the very early universe is now the widely accepted theoretical explanation, but empirical measurements of the subtle predictions of inflation theory are elusive. Dr. Charles Bennett of The Johns Hopkins University is building a sophisticated instrument to make a measurement of the very faint imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) that inflation theory predicts would have been made by gravitational waves. The key is to measure the anisotropy of the so-called ""B mode polarization"" in the CMB. This is a search for a veritable needle in a haystack and great care is required to detect and isolate the very weak distant signature from the very strong unrelated foreground signals on the sky. Dr. Bennett has designed an instrument that he suggests stands the best chance for making this measurement by targeting the scales where the signature is strongest relative to the foreground signals.

AdvACT will perform a large-area survey to search for gravitational waves generated during inflation (B-modes), and measure the isotropy, frequency spectrum, and scale dependence of any detected signal. Measurements of primary CMB fluctuations will improve our knowledge of key cosmological parameters, and measurements of secondary fluctuations will map out the dark matter distribution, potentially providing the first high-signal-to-noise measurement of the sum of the neutrino masses. In addition, AdvACT maps will contain measurements of approximately 20,000 clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect, with heightened scientific impact due to overlap of the survey with X-ray and optical surveys such as eROSITA, the Dark Energy Survey, and LSST.

This telescope is a first Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarimeter, specifically designed to search for CGB signatures while mapping ~2% of the southern sky that is free of the Milky Way foreground galactic radiation at 100 GH and 150 GHz. The BICEP1 telescope will reach its designed sensitivity by the end of 2008. A coordinated series of upgrades to BICEP1 will provide the increased sensitivity and more exacting control of instrumental effects and potential confusion from galactic foregrounds necessary to search for the B-mode signal more deeply through space. A powerful new 150 GHz receiver, BICEP2, will replace the current detector at the beginning of 2009, increasing the mapping speed almost ten-fold. In 2010, the first of a series of compact, mechanically-cooled receivers (called SPUD - Small Polarimeter Upgrade for DASI) will be deployed on the existing DASI mount and tower, providing similar mapping speed at 100 GHz in parallel with BICEP2. The latter instrument will reach (and exceed with the addition of a SPUD polarimeter) the target sensitivity r = 0.15 set forth by the Interagency (NSF/NASA/DoE) Task Force on CMB Research for a future space mission dedicated to the detection and characterization of primordial gravitational waves. This Task Force has identified detection of the Inflation's gravitational waves as the number one priority for the modern cosmology. More broadly, as the cosmology captures a lot of the public imagination, it is a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in basic science. The CGB detection would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of cosmologists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with the technology and instrumentation development, astronomical observations and scientific analysis.

1.41,"This grant funds the research activities of Professors Mina Aganagic, Raphael Bousso, Petr Horava, and Yasunori Nomura at the University of California, Berkeley. <br/><br/>This project involves theoretical research at the crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string theory, with applications ranging from physics beyond the Standard Model to the multiverse approach in cosmology, the interface of string theory and condensed-matter physics, the nature of space and time in quantum gravity, and mathematical implications of topological strings. Professor Aganagic will investigate applications of string theory in gauge theories and mathematics; Professor Bousso will examine the challenges encountered when extracting predictions from the string multiverse, in particular the measure problem of eternal inflation; Professor Horava will continue to study quantum gravity with anisotropic scaling and its connections to string theory, particle phenomenology, the AdS/CFT correspondence, mathematics of the Ricci flow, and lattice gravity; and Professor Nomura will consider various issues in theoretical particle physics and cosmology relevant to experiments coming in the next decades --- in particular the LHC --- with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the origin and nature of dark matter, and the conceptual understanding of the multiverse and its implications for TeV-scale physics.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have considerable broader impacts. These include the training of students and postdocs who will be involved in this research; dissemination of research results to the general public; involvement in QuarkNet; and participation in lecture series and summer schools that reach under-privileged communities."

Pryke, University of Chicago<br/>Collaborative Research: BICEP2 and SPUD - A Search for Inflation with Degree-Scale Polarimetry from the South Pole<br/><br/>The proposed work is a four-year program of research activities directed toward upgrading the BICEP (Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) telescope operating at South Pole since early 2006 to reach far =stretching goals of detection of the Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB) . This telescope is a first Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarimeter, specifically designed to search for CGB signatures while mapping ~2% of the southern sky that is free of the Milky Way foreground galactic radiation at 100 GH and 150 GHz. The BICEP1 telescope will reach its designed sensitivity by the end of 2008. A coordinated series of upgrades to BICEP1 will provide the increased sensitivity and more exacting control of instrumental effects and potential confusion from galactic foregrounds necessary to search for the B-mode signal more deeply through space. A powerful new 150 GHz receiver, BICEP2, will replace the current detector at the beginning of 2009, increasing the mapping speed almost ten-fold. In 2010, the first of a series of compact, mechanically-cooled receivers (called SPUD - Small Polarimeter Upgrade for DASI) will be deployed on the existing DASI mount and tower, providing similar mapping speed at 100 GHz in parallel with BICEP2. The latter instrument will reach (and exceed with the addition of a SPUD polarimeter) the target sensitivity r = 0.15 set forth by the Interagency (NSF/NASA/DoE) Task Force on CMB Research for a future space mission dedicated to the detection and characterization of primordial gravitational waves. This Task Force has identified detection of the Inflation's gravitational waves as the number one priority for the modern cosmology. More broadly, as the cosmology captures a lot of the public imagination, it is a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in basic science. The CGB detection would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB radiation was to the Big Bang. The project will contribute to the training of the next generation of cosmologists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with the technology and instrumentation development, astronomical observations and scientific analysis. Sharing of the forefront research results with public extends the new knowledge beyond the universities. This project will be undertaken in collaboration between the California Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago."

0.50126,"By virtue of their use as standard candles, Type Ia supernovae are key tools in our quest to measure cosmological parameters, to probe the nature of dark energy, to understand the origin of matter, and to unravel the final fate of the universe. However, despite their adoption as distance indicators, questions of possible systematic effects remain open. Observations of individual Type Ia supernova explosions, double white dwarf binary systems, and Type Ia supernova rates in galaxies suggest that they may originate from different progenitor systems and may depend on the population of the host galaxy.<br/><br/>Here, a comprehensive theoretical analysis will be undertaken that will examine merging white dwarfs as a pathway for producing Type Ia supernova. The hope is to better understand possible systematic effects and thereby improve the fidelity of future cosmological observations. The work is expected to lead to an understanding of the Type Ia supernova features produced from double-degenerate mergers based on first-principles physics that can be tested against current and future observations conducted by instruments such as the Supernovae Ia Progenitor Survey (SPY), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM). The analysis includes developing a variety of double white dwarf Type Ia supernova progenitor systems, multi-dimensional simulations of the dynamical merger event with better mass resolution and input physics than previous studies, and statistical tools to generate a set of models that are in the best agreement with the observations of double white dwarf binary systems and double-degenerate Type Ia supernova candidates. <br/><br/>This research will also impact a variety of other areas including cosmology, numerical methods, stellar evolution, massively parallel simulations, and galaxy evolution. This research will also promote national and international partnerships, specifically the LSST consortium and the JDEM enterprise. The project will serve as trans-disciplinary platform for training young scientific talent through the support of a postdoctoral research fellow and the results will be integrated into large classes for undergraduate non-science majors that are intrinsically diverse. Through writing, teaching and public lectures, the team will also broadly disseminate their results to the public. The codes developed here, including software for stellar evolution, nuclear reaction networks, equations of state, thermal conductivities, deflagrations, detonation, numerical methods and hydrodynamics will continue to be added to and release to the public throughout the research."

Current results from this method agree very well with large numerical simulations and semi-analytic models, and to extend this progress, a large number of quasar pairs and groups in close proximity on the sky will be targeted for deep follow-up spectroscopy. Such a large sample can now be identified because of the results from the two largest redshift surveys, which are currently being completed. In addition to their use for this plan, the spectra will be reduced, analyzed and made available to the community. The foremost goal of the project is the geometrical distortion of the observed correlation function of the IGM, the classic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test, which should measure the density of dark energy in the universe to a precision of five percent. Combined with other datasets in preparation, the three-dimensional statistical correlations to be measured will introduce complementary constraints on cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>This research involves significant infrastructure enhancement, considerable student training, and broad dissemination of results of cross-disciplinary interest via MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative.

Progress in computational science together with the adoption of high-level frameworks and modular development have produced widely used community simulation software specific to individual communities. These state-of-the-art codes have been under development and optimization for several years and currently simulate multi-scale, multi-physics phenomena with unprecedented fidelity on petascale platforms. Currently each of these codes have solvers with varied performance characteristics, but all face challenges because of changing hardware architecture. Efforts underway to cope with these challenges, are largely fragmented. While it is true that the scientific codes used in various domains differ significantly from one another, many solutions are likely to be conceptually similar, even if they differ in details. The goal of the proposed conceptualization project, Software Institute for Methodologies and Abstractions for Codes (SIMAC) is to find common abstractions and frameworks applicable across a broad range of applications through cooperation, coordination and interdisciplinary interactions among the participants.

0.34595,"AST-0707480<br/>Stocke<br/><br/>This is a project to measure the change in certain fundamental ""constants"" of nature over cosmic time, using molecular absorption lines in the spectra of very distant sources. Determining whether fundamental constants vary is a frontier study both in modern cosmology and in particle physics. The aim is both to increase the sensitivity of such measurements by a factor of three to five, and to increase the range of cosmic times over which determinations can be made. This involves a search for new, highly-redshifted molecular absorbers, and their use to determine, or set limits on, the rate of change of the fine structure constant, the proton gyromagnetic ratio, and the ratio of proton mass to electron mass. The methodology, focusing on the use of the ""conjugate"" lines of the OH molecule, offers significant advantages compared to other approaches, such as more accurate frequency calibration and minimizing systematic errors due to relative gas motion of different species. As well as considering secular changes in physical constants, this work will measure the molecular gas mass as a function of redshift, make in-situ measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature, find new examples of compact symmetric radio galaxies, test the radio-loud model for Active Galactic Nuclei, and determine the changing physical conditions in star-forming molecular clouds over cosmic time.<br/><br/>In addition to training a new generation of radio astronomers in observing techniques at both the high- and low-frequency ends of the radio spectrum, this study includes developing a planetarium talk, an undergraduate introductory module, and an Aspen workshop, on the implications of the research."
1.59,"This award funds the research activities of Profs. Csaba Csaki, Yuval Grossman, Toichiro Kinoshita, Peter Lepage, Liam McAllister and Maxim Perelstein at Cornell University. <br/><br/>The investigators propose to study some of the most important and exciting topics in a variety of fields within high-energy theory, including particle physics in and beyond the Standard Model, collider physics, string theory, and cosmology. Research on the Standard Model (SM) consists of investigations of flavor and neutrino physics, lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and precision quantum electrodynamics (QED). Beyond the Standard Model, explorations of diverse models of the TeV scale are proposed, together with studies of the new collider physics techniques necessary for testing them. Investigations of aspects of dark matter physics are also proposed. Within string theory the primary focus is on understanding the effective theories arising in string compactifications, and exploring the implications of string theory for cosmology. Intellectual merit: The Cornell particle theory group carries out state-of-the-art research in nearly every major area of modern particle theory. The unifying theme of the group's research program is a distinctive focus on theoretical problems that are relevant for present and future experiments, including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the intensity frontier program, dark matter searches, and cosmic microwave background experiments. The proposed research is directed at maximizing the scientific impact of these experiments. The most important recent development in particle physics is the historic discovery of the Higgs(-like) boson, as part of the wealth of data produced by the 2010-2012 runs of the LHC. Professors Csaki, Grossman and Perelstein will focus their attention over the next five years on physics related to current and future colliders. Csaki will explore unconventional supersymmetric models that are still viable in light of the LHC data; alternative Higgs models, including a Higgslike dilaton and the composite Higgs; and other TeV-scale models consistent with LHC results. Grossman will explore the physics that is relevant to the intensity frontier program in the near and more distant future. This includes charm and beauty physics, charge-parity (CP) violation, and the study of neutrino physics. Perelstein's research plans include using the new window on TeV-scale physics provided by the 125 GeV boson to glean new information about possible physics beyond the Standard Model; understanding the implications of the direct LHC searches for new physics, focusing in particular on naturalness issues; and proposing new LHC searches motivated by both theoretical and experimental developments. In parallel, Perelstein proposes to continue to contribute to theoretical interpretations of dark matter searches, where several interesting hints of detection have already been reported, and much more data will soon become available. Professor Lepage, as a leading member of the ""High Precision QCD"" (HPQCD) lattice gauge theory collaboration, will continue the pursuit of high-precision results for heavy quark physics from lattice gauge theory, obtaining semileptonic D-meson form factors for charm physics; extending b-quark results to the same precision (of order 1%) as the charm observables; and determining the quark masses and the strong coupling constant to high precision. Professor Kinoshita has devoted the past decade to a systematic evaluation of the five-loop QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the electron. In the next few years, he proposes to improve the numerical evaluation of his group's analytic results. Professor McAllister plans to investigate the physics of the very early universe, using cosmological observations of ultraviolet-sensitive quantities to shed light on theories of quantum gravity. McAllister's primary focus will be understanding inflationary dynamics in compactifications of string theory, but he also proposes to study the vacuum structure of non-supersymmetric string compactifications. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The Cornell particle theory group puts a high priority on the training of graduate students and postdocs, as well as on the wide dissemination of recent research results to the general public. Over the past three years, the group graduated twelve students, a majority of whom are now postdocs, while eight of our former students who graduated over the past decade now have faculty positions in the U.S. or abroad. Every member of the group is vigorously pursuing all possibilities for outreach to the general public. Numerous public talks, articles, colloquia, high school lectures and teacher conferences have been produced in the past, and will continue to be organized in the future by the group members."
0.103418,"Studies of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) first detected dark energy, a fundamentally weird component of the Universe that carries enormous implications for both cosmology and particle physics. This project will produce a better measurement of the properties of dark energy, including its equation of state and constraints on how much it could have changed over cosmic time. The PanSTARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System) project will use an unprecedented combination of a 3.3 degree field of view and a 1.8 m collection aperture to increase some 30-fold the current sample of about 300 objects that crudely map out the history of cosmic expansion and the parameters of the dark energy. These new observations will have much higher quality, homogeneity, and freedom from systematic effects than has been heretofore possible.<br/><br/>But because it will not be possible to obtain spectra for the tens of thousands of SNIa that PanSTARRS will detect, Dr. Tonry's group has created a new powerful classifier with explicit freedom from assumptions about the nature of SNIa (such as the homogeneity of explosion, properties of enshrouding dust, or evolution with redshift). These automatic methods use precision light curves to measure both luminosity distance and redshift for each SNIa, and can determine whether a light curve is that of a SNIa or something else. The current project will use these techniques to classify the transient detections from PanSTARRS, estimate SNIa redshift and distance, and measure the time history of the expansion of the Universe to determine the properties of dark energy. It will also investigate exceptionally over- or under-luminous SNIa, and critically examine SNIa metallicity effects and the properties of dust extinction. Finally, this work will establish SNIa rates as a function of host galaxy star formation to search for SNIa subclasses arising from prompt or delayed white dwarf explosions.<br/><br/>Dark energy is apparently the main source of gravitation in the Universe, causing it to expand exponentially, and profoundly affecting galaxy formation and the creation of stars, planets, and people. A better measurement of dark energy will constrain particle physics theories, and affect our understanding of how galaxies and stars grew in the Universe. It is critical to carry out the most basic tests of isotropy and homogeneity, because it is certainly possible that we are being fooled by an even stranger Universe than we have dared to guess."
0.6,"This award funds the research of Professor Alexander Vilenkin at Tufts University.<br/><br/>Recent developments in cosmology suggest that much of the universe is in a state of explosive accelerated expansion, called inflation. We live in a ""bubble"" where inflation has ended, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. A major unresolved problem in this theory of eternal inflation is the problem of calculating relative probabilities of different measurements. In the course of eternal inflation, any event having a nonzero probability will happen an infinite number of times, and comparing infinities is an inherently ambiguous task. The challenge is to formulate a compelling probability measure prescription. This will put the theory on a much firmer footing and will (at least in principle) allow its observational tests. Another major topic of this research is the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic strings. Strings can be formed as high-energy linear defects in the early universe and can produce a variety of observational effects at the present time. A detection of cosmic strings would be of great importance, as it would open a unique window into the physics of very high energies and into the early history of the universe.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The new worldview that has emerged from the eternal inflation scenario has far-reaching implications beyond physics. Professor Vilenkin will continue presenting these ideas in public lectures, in popular articles, and in popular magazine and TV interviews. The research described above will be done with active collaboration of graduate students and postdocs, thus providing crucial training to the young physicists."

Measuring weak gravitational lensing -- the way in which the cluster's gravitational pull distorts the path of light from distant galaxies lying behind it -- will provide additional mass estimates. The results of this study will relate measures of the optical richness (the number and brightness of its member galaxies) of each cluster to its mass.<br/><br/>The results of this work will be used to test theories of cosmic structure formation, which can predict how the mass that galaxy clusters should build up through cosmic time.

The dynamics of stellar systems with twisted isophotes will be explored considering the (neglected) possibility that there are real internal misalignments of different components. The dynamical consequences of the recent results indicating very large M/L's in galactic nuclei will be studied. Previous work on the formation of clusters will be extended to different cosmologies by treating the dark matter separately from the galaxies. The purpose of these numerical simulations will be to explore the separation of dark matter from luminous matter during cluster formation and evolution, to understand better whether cluster profiles can be used to estimate the mass density of the Universe, to study the formation of disk galaxies and the evolution of galaxy mass and luminosity functions, and to attempt to understand whether subclustering can be used as a cosmological probe."

0.179398,"AST 0204514<br/>Loeb<br/><br/>According to the most current theories of cosmology, hydrogen, the most abundant element left over from the big bang, was formed out of free electrons and protons when the Universe cooled below a temperature of a few thousand degrees. However, recent observations imply that most of this relic cosmic hydrogen was dissociated once again (i.e., `re-ionized') less than a billion years after the big bang. It is commonly believed that the cosmic hydrogen was re-ionized by the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the first generation of stars and black holes in the universe. How and when did the first galaxies form in the Universe? What was their effect on the surrounding cosmic gas? These are two of the most exciting questions in observational and theoretical cosmology today. This project will combine analytic calculations and limited numerical simulations of radiative transfer problems to address these questions and make detailed predictions for the expected clues that future, cutting-edge observations might reveal. In particular, it will identify observational probes that could signal the cosmic time at which most of the hydrogen was re-ionized.

0.178,"Dr. Jacobs is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Arizona State University. The goal of the research is to detect evidence of the first stars, thought to be born sometime about 500 Million years after the Big Bang. These stars emitted intense radiation which burned away the universe's pervasive atmosphere of Hydrogen. As hydrogen accounts for three quarters of the normal matter in the universe, this last global cosmological process underpins much of what is known about cosmology and galaxy formation. However, observing this time period in ordinary star light challenges the world's premier telescopes due to the extreme distance and faintness of the early stars. The goal of this research program is to detect and characterize radio emission from intergalactic hydrogen before and during its ionization using two recently completed radio telescopes. Detecting and characterizing the predicted radio signature of this ""Cosmic Dawn"" was rated as a top priority by the astronomical community. This project will also support a student volunteer corps who will take a portable a planetarium to schools and who will be directly involved in developing elements for museum and planetarium facilities. These include a state of the art 3D planetarium theater, in the recently constructed Arizona State University astronomy building.<br/><br/>Recent advances in digital technology allow the construction of very large arrays of antennae which provide the necessary sensitivity to detect radio emission from Hydrogen when the universe was only 300Mya old. Emitted at a wavelength of 21cm, the radiation is stretched by cosmological expansion to an observed wavelength of 1.5 to 3m depending on the time period under observation. Both the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) have been designed to observe these wavelengths at the necessary sensitivity and are constructed, in large part with funding from the National Science Foundation, far from interfering human radio emission; the MWA is in Western Australia and PAPER is in the Karoo desert of South Africa. Using both telescopes, Dr. Jacobs will compile a deep statistical measure of the amount of radiation coming from Hydrogen in the early universe. Portions of the work include performing observations, measuring and removing other bright interfering signals from other bright astronomical objects, and applying this new knowledge to building larger telescopes capable of directly imaging the early universe. These measurements of bright interfering signals will form a substantial, interesting, and compellingly beautiful image of the universe and provide a foundation data set for exhibits produced by the student corps created as a part of the project.

A standard assumption made in all halo occupation studies is that the mass of a dark matter halo completely determines the properties of its resident galaxy population. Mounting observational evidence indicates that galaxy properties, in particular star formation rates, are correlated with halo properties other than mass, such as halo age or concentration. This ""galaxy assembly bias"" (GAB) is a significant source of systematic error, both in efforts to understand galaxy evolution and in the precision cosmology program. In order to ensure the unbiased interpretation of forthcoming data, this proposal aims to develop the next generation halo occupation models that properly account for GAB. The researchers will identify the optimal set of observational diagnostics that can be used to infer the presence and strength of GAB, develop open-source software that properly accounts for GAB, and explore methods to mitigate the impacts of GAB by using alternative definitions of halo mass.

0.36,"Predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, gravitational waves have evaded direct detection for nearly a century due to their exquisitely small amplitudes. However, with the arrival of the second-generation gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, first detections of gravitational waves produced in astrophysical and cosmological processes are expected to be made over the next decade. This project focuses on gravitational waves emitted on long time scales, such as the stationary stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) generated by an incoherent superposition of signals from many independent sources. The project also targets transient gravitational-wave signals on the time-scales of minutes, hours or longer, generated by a variety of astrophysical processes such as dynamically formed black-hole binaries or fragmentation in accretion disks around black holes. Cross-correlation techniques will be applied to the first data to be acquired by the second-generation detectors in search for these long-lasting signals. With over 1000 times better sensitivity than the latest published results, these searches will probe and constrain a number of proposed SGWB models. Furthermore, the SGWB models will be systematically studied to precisely identify the open science questions within these models that could be pursued by the second-generation detectors. Examples of such open questions include: What is the equation of state in neutron stars? What is the coalescence rate of binary neutron stars? Which cosmological models of SGWB are accessible to the second-generation detectors?<br/><br/>This project is expected to have a strong impact on cosmology and astrophysics. For example, the SGWB is expected to be generated just moments after the Big Bang, and hence may contain unique information about the first moments in the evolution of the universe and about the physics of highest energy scales, which is otherwise not accessible in laboratories. Similarly, the SGWB could be of astrophysical origin: for example, summing up contributions from all binary neutron stars, binary black holes, magnetars, or Supernovae in the universe leads to a stochastic gravitational-wave ""foreground"" that contains information about these most violent objects and events in the universe. The long-lasting transient gravitational-wave signals will also provide information about the astrophysical objects and processes that generated them. For example, direct detection of gravitational-wave signals produced by dynamically formed black hole binaries would shed light on the population of black holes that lurk in the inner regions of nearby galaxies, revealing their density and velocity distribution."
0.999926,"Parallel machines with over a hundred thousand processors are now being built. NSF's widely accessible TeraScale facilities have already deployed a 3,000 processor machine. Algorithmic advances have made it possible to solve problems at a much faster rate. However, complexity of these algorithms and parallelizing them remain a hindrance to advances in scientific computing. This project will develop an object based methodology to simplify development of highly efficient parallel applications. A run-time system will be developed to automatically distribute the user's object based application among various processors. This novel system observes the running program to apply dynamically an intelligent suite of strategies to effect optimization. Parallel components can be plugged in and out of running computations and exchange data with each other in a flexible manner. <br/>The development of this infrastructure will provide a framework to allow easy building of particle-oriented parallel programs to be used to model galaxies, dark matter, stars, planets, and gas particles in computational astrophysics. The new framework will allow simulations to operate efficiently with billions of particles and tens of thousands of processors. These simulations will be able to make direct contact with satellite and ground-based astronomical data to obtain cosmological parameters with high precision and to study how planets form."
1.388381,"The Universality of Gravitational Free Fall, the underlying symmetry of general relativity (Einstein's theory of gravity), will be tested with unprecedented precision and generality. There are two strong reasons for testing this symmetry. First, general relativity is not a quantum theory and current ideas about quantum gravity naturally produce violations of the Universality of Free Fall that may be experimentally accessible. Discovery of such fields would have profound consequences for our understanding of gravity and perhaps of cosmology. Second, by searching for violations of a symmetry that general relativity holds to be exact, one can probe for new, ultra-weak, non-gravitational fields. Current ideas in cosmology suggest that much of the energy in the universe may be tied up in such fields. Although such ultra-weak fields would normally be obscured by gravitational forces, they are detectable because they generically violate the Universality of Free Fall.<br/> The proposed tests require the continued improvement of instruments for detecting tiny differences in the accelerations of test bodies attracted toward the earth, the sun, large-scale cosmological structures, or toward a massive uranium laboratory source. The test bodies include Be, Al, Ti, Cu, Pb, plus bodies having compositions close to the earth's core and the moon respectively. Three different torsion-balance instruments, initially developed under previous NSF support, will be upgraded and employed in this work. The combination of these instruments will test the Universality of Free Fall for Yukawa length scales from 1 cm to infinity with differential acceleration resolutions down to 10-13 cm/s2. The torsion balance instruments will be adapted to probe for spin-dependent forces by using an electron-spin polarized pendulum and attractor. In addition, the Newtonian constant G will be measured using a new technique that avoids important sources of error in previous measurements. Recent results for G have scattered widely, demonstrating the necessity of several independent measurements of this fundamental constant. The technique should be capable of determining G to a precision of 1 part in 105."
0.167199,"ABSTRACT 9320045 Hogan This grant will support research on two projects in observational cosmology. As a test of hot big bang cosmology, the PI and a graduate student propose to measure the cosmic abundance of deuterium in high redshift QSO absorption clouds, using high-resolution spectra (about 10- 20 km/sec) of five QSO's with high column density hydrogen absorbers known to be optically thick in the Lyman continuum. Using fits to a number of Lyman series absorption lines in each absorption system they aim to obtain D/H in the absorbing clouds with sufficient accuracy for a rigorous test of cosmological theory, a test of the universal character of the deuterium abundance, and a measurement of the abundance in a relatively pristine environment where the universe is much younger. The PI and another graduate student propose to detect and catalogue line-emitting galaxies near damped QSO absorbers, using narrow-band imaging of damped QSO absorber and high-redshift protogalaxies, which will be used to constrain theories of cosmic structure formation. Data for both projects will be gathered primarily at the new 3.5M telescope at the Apache Point Observatory. ***"

2.19,"This proposal is for the study of gravitational physics and cosmology through measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The research has two main components that complement what we expect to find with the Planck satellite and other measurements. In the first component, we continue our support and leadership of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Specifically, working with the ACT team, we will test detectors for, build, deploy, observe with, and analyze data from ACTPol, a new polarization sensitive receiver. The scientific payoff from ACT, measuring the CMB at small angular scales, has been considerable thus far and we expect ACTPol to be as successful if not more so. In the second component, we will observe with, upgrade, and analyze data from the Atacama B-mode Survey (ABS). ABS is aimed at detecting the signature of primordial gravitational waves in the polarization of the CMB at large angular scales.<br/><br/>Measurements of the CMB have revolutionized our understanding of the universe. We now have a standard model of cosmology that is so well tested we may use it as a foundation. The current generation of measurements is aimed at such things as determining the mass sum of neutrinos, elusive sub-atomic particles, and finding primordial gravitation waves. Thus CMB observations are touching on and informing everything from particle physics to quantum gravity. The lure of this exciting science has led to the invention of new types of detectors and detecting systems as well as to new algorithms for analyzing the data. The research is done by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs who are active participants in international collaborations. These students and postdocs go on not only in astrophysics but in other branches of science and in research labs as well. For example, former students are working at NIST on advanced X-ray detectors, which are intimately related to our detectors, for threat assessment and other applications."

The CMB is the cleanest probe of the physics of the nascent universe. In addition to unveiling fundamental physics during the first instants of the universe, the CMB provides information about the dark energy causing the present-day acceleration of the universe, is sensitive to the sum of the neutrino masses, can help locate the baryons that we know must exist but wich have not yet been found, and tells us how cosmic structure emerged in the early universe.

0.497855,"A short time after the Big Bang, the Cosmic Dawn emerged and featured the formation of the first stars, black holes, and galaxies. Neutral hydrogen gas dominated the Universe during this epoch. As the life cycle of the first stars ended and the first black holes formed, the intergalactic medium (IGM) was heated, and the neutral hydrogen was ionized during the Epoch of Reionization. The cosmic reionization of hydrogen remains one of the poorly understood and constrained frontiers of modern cosmology. Current constraints of reionization from observations of cosmic microwave background and high-redshift quasars point to a rapid change of the ionization state of the universe from a redshift of z between 6 and 10. The crucial stage of reionization in between and the formation of first galaxies are closely linked to each other. Observations of galaxies beyond a redshift of z around 6, one of the main science goals of many space-based and ground-based facilities and surveys, can provide critical data for learning about cosmic reionization.<br/><br/>This project will carry out a comprehensive theoretical investigation of using Ly-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs), efficiently detectable beyond a redshift z around 6, to constrain the late stage of reionization. Because Ly-alpha photons emitted from these galaxies interact with the circumgalactic and intergalactic media, Ly-alpha emission is a sensitive probe of the reionization state. The investigators will combine a state-of-the-art cosmological reionization simulation with an efficient Monte Carlo Ly-alpha radiative transfer code to obtain detailed and realistic L-alpha emission properties of LAEs in a large survey-like volume. The primary science goals include (1) studying and designing a variety of statistics to address how to use different aspects of observed LAEs to probe reionization; (2) implementing several prescriptions of galactic winds to address one of the major uncertainties in the visibility of LAEs during reionization; (3) making specific predictions and forming mock LAE observations to help developing observational strategies and guiding observational efforts. Advancing the understanding of early structure formation, the comprehensive Ly-alpha radiative transfer modeling of star-forming galaxies in a cosmological volume across the reionization epoch will provide a solid theoretical basis to interpret observations and to constrain reionization and will provide support to current and future space- and ground-based facilities and surveys. The data generated from this study will be made available to the scientific community through a designated web page for a variety of applications.<br/><br/>Educationally, undergraduate students will be actively involved in projects that support the research program. The principal investigator will help establish a collaboration in education and outreach between the Museum of Natural History of Utah and the Observatory of the University of Utah. He will enrich the astronomy component in the ""Scientist in the Spotlight"" program at the Museum, and he will also interact with the general public at weekly star parties on campus."
0.05,"High energy physics and particle astrophysics are very dynamical fields that have revealed evidence of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics through the discovery of neutrino oscillations, dark matter and dark energy. This project is aimed at advancing the theoretical understanding of such aspects of physics beyond the standard model and at maximizing the amount of information that can be obtained from the experimental data by considering new analysis frameworks and exploring new connections between different phenomena. The project integrates an educational outreach program aimed at high school teachers. Neutrino experiments are a large component of both the intensity and cosmic frontiers of exploration in particle physics. The research covers theoretical aspects of several different science topics that can be studied using large neutrino detectors. More specifically: The PI will work on optimizing the next generation of neutrino experiments and developing a better framework for understanding the data and its implications for theoretical models. An extensive study of atmospheric neutrino oscillations in present and future large neutrino detectors will be performed, extending the PIs investigation of such oscillations in the Ice-Cube Deep Core detector. Topics to be explored include: non-standard neutrino interactions in matter; tests for the existence of new species of sterile neutrinos; the value of the atmospheric neutrino data, which covers a large range of energies and propagation distances, in combination with precise neutrino data from long baseline neutrino experiments and other observations. Supernova neutrinos from a galactic explosion would be observed in very large numbers by present and future neutrino detectors. The PI will explore possible analytic solutions to the flavor oscillation equations for streaming neutrinos in a supernova, especially the effects of neutrino-neutrino scattering, by employing methods used to study collective effects in other fields of science. Such solutions could help in simplifying the very involved numerical simulations of supernova neutrino propagation and thus lead to a better understanding of the information that can be obtained from a supernova neutrino detection. The project will address the potential for indirect dark matter detection in large neutrino detectors. Investigation of its value in the context of a general theoretical framework and in connection with other dark matter searches and potential discoveries is also proposed. High energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology and the questions they are trying to address are very exciting and capture the interest of a larger public, providing excellent outreach opportunities. Penn State University and the Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium coordinate an annual series of summer Science Workshops for Educators aimed at secondary school teachers. The PI and her experimenter colleagues and have successfully developed such a workshop in particle astrophysics. For the future they will continue organizing such summer schools and expand the interactive activities."

0.12,"The early universe must have contained tiny initial fluctuations, which later grew by the attractive force of gravity as the universe expanded, to become the structures we observe in the universe today. This proposal aims to empirically examine the properties of these primordial fluctuations, and to refine theoretical predictions about their properties. On the phenomenological side, and building on previous work by the PI, the proposal discusses tests of statistical homogeneity and isotropy. If averages of cosmic density fields are invariant under translations, we speak of statistical homogeneity; if they are additionally invariant under rotations we speak of statistical isotropy. Both are two of the key assumptions that underlie most of our analyses of the origin and growth of structure, so it is crucial to test both empirically. On the theoretical side, the PI proposes to further study the predictions of inflation, the leading explanation for the origin of the primordial perturbations. At the end of inflation, the inflaton field must decay into the hot radiation of the Big Bang, in a process known as reheating. The PI plans to study the survival of non-adiabatic perturbations after inflation, and several aspects related to the quantum nature of the inflaton decay. These studies are important to unveil the details of a process that remains hidden by the resulting thermal equilibrium. Reheating may also have indirect implications on the Gaussianity of the primordial perturbations. Calculations of the degree of primordial non-Gaussianity produced during inflation have neglected the couplings needed for the universe to reheat. The PI intends to include the effects of such couplings, in order to verify whether they can be neglected, and thus confirm one of the key predictions of single-field inflationary models. The broader impacts of this proposal are as follows: As a major component of his efforts in public education, the PI plans to draw from his Hispanic background to promote the diffusion of cosmology among Hispanic minorities in the Syracuse area. In collaboration with the Spanish Action League of Onondaga County he proposes to extend the multi-disciplinary educational program in astronomy and cosmology addressed to Hispanic children that he started in 2007. The program is structured in a series of weekly ninety minute sessions in which children aged six to ten are exposed to basic concepts in astronomy and cosmology. In the coming years, the PI intends to build on the successes of the first year of life of the program, and to correct and address the challenges that have emerged so far."

1.078,"This award enables the Stanford University group led by Principle Investigator Patricia Burchat to maximize the long-term benefit of its investment in the BABAR experiment at SLAC and contribute to a new effort in observational cosmology through the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The intellectual merit of the project follows from searching for ways to improve the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The SM does not address the ""hierarchy"" problem and its particle content does not contain a candidate for the dark matter in the Universe. The highly sensitive searches and precision studies conducted with bottom, charm and tau decays at the B Factories impose severe constraints on any model that is introduced to address the deficiencies of the SM. The analyses that will be conducted by the Stanford group on the final BABAR data sample will leave a legacy of results that will help define the theories that are developed to describe the universe. The Stanford group will complete ongoing searches for new physics in rare or forbidden charm and B decays, conduct the final time-dependent Dalitz-plot analysis of B -> rho-pi to extract the CKM angle alpha, begin studies to elucidate the nature of recently observed but perplexing charmonium-like states, and continue to play a significant role in organizing the production of the simulated data samples needed to carry out all physics analyses in BABAR. The initiation of a program based on the LSST will enable the group to study gravitational lensing as a cosmological probe which is sensitive to all matter in the universe - baryonic and dark matter. The Stanford group has been focusing on pre-LSST astronomical data sets (in particular, images of deep galaxy clusters from the 8-meter Subaru telescope) to gain technical experience in ""pipeline"" development needed for analysis of gravitational lensing, especially photometry and the measurement of galaxy shapes, and studies related to systematic uncertainties that will potentially limit the sensitivity of LSST for cosmology. Broader impacts include participation in an inter-experiment study of issues related to data preservation and long-term analysis in high energy physics, particularly directed to the BaBar data set. As part of this effort, the Stanford group is focusing on how long-term data storage and access can be optimized for outreach and education to benefit the general public, high school students and teachers, students in college-level particle physics courses, and the training of future graduate students in particle physics. Prototype formats and tutorials are being designed and developed, and will be tested in a particle physics course taught by the PI.

Deep inside the stellar galaxy, most of the hot gas originates from mass loss from normally evolving stars; further out, gas has accumulated by intergalactic accretion. When cosmic gas falls onto the dark matter halos surrounding giant elliptical galaxies, its kinetic energy is converted into heat, reaching temperatures as hot as the center of the<br/>sun! This gas is heated even further -- and enriched in heavy elements -- by supernovae explosions from young massive stars. Understanding this latter type of heating is a central problem in modern cosmology -- the ""feedback"" problem -- and this is one of the key problems addressed in this project. Elliptical galaxies are perhaps the most dramatic manifestations of these ancient heating activity.<br/><br/>The theoretical calculations in this project are aimed at understanding the complex interplay of gas ejection from young star-forming galaxies and the subsequent evolution of this gas into the enormous X-ray clouds typically observed around elliptical galaxies. The calculations begin with initial concentrations of dark matter in an expanding universe, and after 13 billion years the computed radial variation of gas density, temperature and iron enrichment all agree with X-ray observations of large elliptical galaxies. This project will build on these results to study the heating of diffuse gas in groups of galaxies, the way collective supernova-driven galactic winds can produce the abundances of elements typically observed in the richest clusters of galaxies, the physics of the gas cooling process in clusters of galaxies, and the way X-ray emission lines in from the cores of cooling flows is absorbed by partially cooled gas.

To do so, he will resolve some difficulties that have arisen in the treatment of gravitons (the quanta that transmit gravitational forces) in de Sitter space, and understand how quantum effects can influence the physical stability of this model. The ""cosmic string"" model can account for the temperature fluctuations expected to occur in the microwave background radiation. He is constructing a computer simulation of the motion of loops of ""cosmic string"" which are supposed to cause galaxies to form in the model. He will study the distribution of these model galaxies in space and compare it with what astronomers observe in the sky. Finally, he will use a new mathematical formalism invented by Vilkovisky and DeWitt for calculating quantum effects.

0.225273,"AST 0205010<br/>White<br/><br/>Cosmology has made tremendous advances in the past decade, with many fundamental questions approaching resolution. We now have a highly predictive theory for the emergence of large-scale structure in the Universe. As is often the case, this theory raises new questions, and several crucial issues still remain to be understood. First, the nature of most of the matter in the Universe remains mysterious. Second, while we have known for some time that earthly matter doesn't dominate the energy in the Universe, we now believe that not even exotic `dark' matter plays that role. At present the Universe appears to be accelerating, driven by a mysterious component dubbed ""dark energy''. Luckily we are in a ""golden era'' of cosmological observations. Upcoming observations will soon constrain the initial conditions for structure formation and many cosmological parameters, allowing us to address the next frontier: the era of structure formation. A thorough understanding of structure formation is instrumental in determining both the consequences of the developing 'cosmic web' paradigm and the constraints on variations within this paradigm. The key to this understanding is clusters of galaxies. These are the largest known objects. They exhibit remarkable regularity, but our understanding of their structure is sensitive to our modeling assumptions. This project will construct computer models of galaxy clusters to develop and refine methods which will relate the properties of these clusters to the distribution and nature of the dark matter and the dark energy and thus to sharpen our tests of this dominant paradigm.<br/>***"
0.267188,"The goal of this collaborative project is to improve the current measurement of cosmological quantities, in particular the Hubble constant and the Dark Energy component, using time delay measurements from strong gravitational lenses acting upon quasars. This includes analysis of already taken data, as well as the anticipated discovery of approximately 50 new lenses. Gravitational time delays are not only independent of other methods but are also a very cost effective probe, requiring just a few hours on an 8-10m telescope for modeling the lens, and subsequent monitoring on 1m class telescopes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. At the K-12 level, Dr. Treu collaborates with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural history (SBMNH) and Las Cumbres Observatories GlobalTelescope Network to organize public lectures, and establish an astronomy curriculum at the UC-operated Sedgwick Natural Reserve.

0.083214,"AST 9624592 Abstract - Bernstein The dark matter which dominates the Universe does not emit detectable radiation, but does distort images of background objects by the gravitational deflection of the passing light rays. The research plan is to measure these ""weak gravitational lensing"" effects to determine the true shapes of galaxy clusters and the spectrum of the mass fluctuations in the present-day Universe. These weak lensing distortions are now being used to measure the mass distributions of the inner parts of a few rich clusters of galaxies. The mass profiles of 10 clusters of galaxies will be measured to a larger radius. This is of great interest since theoretical N-body simulations show that cluster shapes and profiles are sensitive to the value of the cosmological density parameter Omega, and to the nature of the dark matter particles. A particularly interesting case is the weak cluster 0957+561, which contains a multiply-imaged quasar with known time delay. By mapping the cluster mass, the modeling of this lens will be improved and an improved value for the Hubble constant will be obtained. The timely completion of these observations requires the use of a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) mosaic camera on a telescope with good seeing. A CCD camera for the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) 2.4m telescope will be constructed. Weak gravitations lensing in random parts of the sky has now been tentatively detected. The weak gravitational distortions of several million field galaxies will be measured, the results from these measurements will provide unambiguous quantitative measurements of: the strength of mass fluctuations on 8 Mpc scales, where linear perturbation theory holds and the fluctuations are directly related to quantum processes in the early Universe; the slope of the power spectrum in the in smaller regions, which distinguishes between present rival models of the structure formation; the power spectrum on >100 kpc scales, where clues to the nature of galaxy formation and dark matter halos will be found; and the growth rate of these structures over the last third of the history of the Universe. These measurements are only feasible if imaging devices with extremely large throughput are used. The Large Area CCD (LACCD) mosaic camera will be completed and mounted on the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) 4m telescope in Chile, giving larger throughput than any other instrument there. Both cameras (at MDM and CTIO) to be completed under this grant will become facility instruments and made available to other astronomers. The completed instruments will also be used to enhance the education of students at the University of Michigan. Ph. D. students will obtain previously unavailable instrumentation experience, and selected undergraduate astronomy majors will work with instruments in Michigan and at observatory sites. The introductory courses for non-science major undergraduates will be revamped, with an emphasis on improving the students' visualization and problem-solving abilities by introducing more modern laboratory exercises and improved classroom demonstrations. The results of this program, and current results by other Astronomy Department members, will be communicated to high school science teachers and students throughout the State of Michigan via a monthly full-color ""Image-of-the-Month"" club mailing."
0.212517,"AST-0407072<br/>Klypin<br/><br/>This project addresses the so-called crisis in cosmology on small scales, using satellites of isolated galaxies, galaxies in nearby voids, and detailed models of rotation curves. Combining the analysis of observations with theory, methods will be used that complement and expand the traditional approach. A full scale Bayesian probabilistic analysis of satellite galaxy kinematics, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, will probe the (mainly dark matter) mass distribution in the peripheral regions of isolated galaxies. A related part of the crisis, the galaxy content of nearby voids, will be analyzed with shallow samples over a large magnitude range, which will then be compared with cosmological simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the reconstruction of mass profiles from rotation curves must depend on galaxy type, and small variations can significantly mar the mass estimates. Therefore, the present research includes the production of publicly available models of disk galaxies embedded in realistic cosmological dark matter halos. <br/><br/>The intent is to raise the quality and reliability of results coming from satellite dynamics, and along the way train two female graduate students and provide catalogs and numerical models to the entire community."

Most of the matter of the universe (the ""dark matter"", solidly established by astronomical and cosmological observations) consists of something undiscovered, and thus there must exist new particles not in the Standard Model. Additionally, the presence of the Higgs boson and the expected properties of a quantum field theory together suggest that new particles and fields will be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, because the properties of both of these new sets of particles are unknown, a broad theoretical study is required in order to evaluate what possible new particles might be discoverable with present techniques and what new search strategies might be needed. As part of this project, Professor Weiner intends to investigate a broad range of theoretical scenarios, both top-down (motivated by new and existing theoretical scenarios) and bottom-up (motivated by new signatures) as well as their experimental implications for the LHC and for direct-detection experiments. Additionally, Professor Weiner will pursue studies to understand the sensitivities of dark-matter searches, with a focus on the sensitivities of the astrophysical assumptions present in the existing analyses.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will be wide ranging.

These satellites within the Local Group include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times.<br/><br/>Extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models in order to learn how the dynamical -, merger -, assembly -, star formation -, and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems fit together in the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy for which were previously studied by the investigators. The Milky Way and M31 are both spiral galaxies but have different populations of satellite galaxies for which an explanations needs to be found. The additional data for M31 are important for evaluating solutions to the ?missing satellites problem? in Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations, where the number of subhalos is predicted to be higher than the number of observed satellites. So far the Milky Way is the only system for which the comparison to models can be made which will change when the results of this study are available.<br/><br/>The three principal investigators have a standing collaboration and they have initiated the SPLASH (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo) survey with previous support from the NSF. The methods and techniques used here are well established in this collaboration. The SPLASH survey uses the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II telescope and the 4-m telescope with Mosaic CCD wide field Imager at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The survey extends to study red giant branch stars in more satellite galaxies of the Andromeda system. The group has already 139 DEIMOS masks (about 20,000 spectra) and spectroscopy of M31 red giant candidates selected from the imaging data. The goal is to observe another 135 DEIMOS masks to obtain spectra of more than 100 member red giant stars in each of the known and any newly found dSph satellites of M31. Further spectra are thought for about 3,000 stars in M33, a low-luminosity disk satellite interacting with M31; and about 1,000 stars in the NE shelf which is tidal debris from a past M31 satellite associated with the Giant Southern Stream in M31.<br/><br/>One part of the work combines spectral and photometric diagnostics to isolate M31 red giants efficiently. Further there are measurements of precision stellar velocities to derive velocity dispersions in dwarf galaxies and tidal streams, which are both kinematically cold subsystems. Measurements of elemental abundances from moderate resolution co-added spectra tare used o constrain the chemical enrichment/star formation histories of M31 satellites. Theoretical models are used to determine the dark matter mass of each dwarf satellite galaxy in M31 to place the observations within a cosmological framework. This will give more data to decipher how the evolution of the Milky Way and M31 can be described in the context of Lambda-CDM cosmology.<br/><br/>This work provides another data set for a galaxy system to test Lambda-CDM cosmologies. This will have a broad impact on other fields. The DEIMOS-derived chemical abundances are of interest for stellar population studies community.

0.24,"The main aim of this project is to complete the formulation of effective descriptions of quantum systems in canonical language. Especially the field of canonical quantum gravity (including loop quantum gravity) requires a more general setting than standard effective actions, allowing for instance for an enlarged gauge structure, general covariance and the associated freedom to change the time variable, and a non-Gaussian or non-vacuum state as expansion basis. Compared to existing formulations, the major extension provided by work in the project will lead to a canonical version of effective quantum field theory. Applications will include an analysis of renormalization in canonical quantum gravity, comparisons with existing results in effective quantum gravity to check the low-energy limit of loop quantum gravity, as well as structure formation in the early universe and possible restrictions on initial states.<br/><br/>Quantum gravity is expected to be important at high energy density, for instance in the early universe during or just after the big-bang. In such regimes, space-time itself, and not just matter in space-time, is described by a wave function subject to quantum uncertainty and fluctuations. For several conceptual and technical reasons, it is difficult to evaluate such wave functions for potential physical observations, but as in particle physics, their implications can often be approximated and derived using effective equations. Standard methods of particle physics are not directly applicable to quantum gravity, in which the classical structure of space-time is no longer available. This project aims to complete the setting of effective equations suitable for quantum gravity, a process in which several questions of mathematical interest (such as Poisson geometry and algebraic structures) will be touched as well.

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search.

0.58907,"Proposal Title: PECASE: Measuring Cosmology and the Evolution of Structure via Gravitational Lensing<br/>Institution: Brown University<br/><br/>Dr. Dell'Antonio of Brown University is awarded funds to conduct the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), for which observations have already begun at the four-meter telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory and Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory. Through this survey, Dr. Dell'Antonio will attempt to determine the amount of dark matter (DM) in the universe by studying its gravitational lensing signal in a wide-field, deep optical imaging survey. The phenomenon of weak gravitational lensing occurs when matter along the line of sight, which might otherwise be unobservable, magnifies and distorts the images of background galaxies. Because gravitational lensing is sensitive to all forms of mass, not just luminous (ordinary) matter, it is an ideal tool for studying DM. In addition, because the different models for the DM predict different degrees of clustering, the actual distribution of mass can offer clues to the nature of the DM. This project will determine the 2-dimensional distribution of projected mass in the universe with great accuracy, and the 3-dimensional distribution with somewhat less accuracy. The 3-dimensional distribution makes it possible to study the evolution of clustering with distance from earth (and thus look-back time). The evolution of clustering at redshifts between 0 and 1 depends critically on the amount and nature of the dark energy (DE) thought to be responsible for the present acceleration of the expansion of the universe, so this proposal will differentiate between possible models for the DE.<br/>Dr. Dell'Antonio will also use the data - which will include multi-color imaging of about 25 million stars and galaxies - to design ancillary science projects at several different levels.

0.518061,"AST 9624592 Abstract - Bernstein The dark matter which dominates the Universe does not emit detectable radiation, but does distort images of background objects by the gravitational deflection of the passing light rays. The research plan is to measure these ""weak gravitational lensing"" effects to determine the true shapes of galaxy clusters and the spectrum of the mass fluctuations in the present-day Universe. These weak lensing distortions are now being used to measure the mass distributions of the inner parts of a few rich clusters of galaxies. The mass profiles of 10 clusters of galaxies will be measured to a larger radius. This is of great interest since theoretical N-body simulations show that cluster shapes and profiles are sensitive to the value of the cosmological density parameter Omega, and to the nature of the dark matter particles. A particularly interesting case is the weak cluster 0957+561, which contains a multiply-imaged quasar with known time delay. By mapping the cluster mass, the modeling of this lens will be improved and an improved value for the Hubble constant will be obtained. The timely completion of these observations requires the use of a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) mosaic camera on a telescope with good seeing. A CCD camera for the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) 2.4m telescope will be constructed. Weak gravitations lensing in random parts of the sky has now been tentatively detected. The weak gravitational distortions of several million field galaxies will be measured, the results from these measurements will provide unambiguous quantitative measurements of: the strength of mass fluctuations on 8 Mpc scales, where linear perturbation theory holds and the fluctuations are directly related to quantum processes in the early Universe; the slope of the power spectrum in the in smaller regions, which distinguishes between present rival models of the structure formation; the power spectrum on >100 kpc scales, where clues to the nature of galaxy formation and dark matter halos will be found; and the growth rate of these structures over the last third of the history of the Universe. These measurements are only feasible if imaging devices with extremely large throughput are used. The Large Area CCD (LACCD) mosaic camera will be completed and mounted on the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) 4m telescope in Chile, giving larger throughput than any other instrument there. Both cameras (at MDM and CTIO) to be completed under this grant will become facility instruments and made available to other astronomers. The completed instruments will also be used to enhance the education of students at the University of Michigan. Ph. D. students will obtain previously unavailable instrumentation experience, and selected undergraduate astronomy majors will work with instruments in Michigan and at observatory sites. The introductory courses for non-science major undergraduates will be revamped, with an emphasis on improving the students' visualization and problem-solving abilities by introducing more modern laboratory exercises and improved classroom demonstrations. The results of this program, and current results by other Astronomy Department members, will be communicated to high school science teachers and students throughout the State of Michigan via a monthly full-color ""Image-of-the-Month"" club mailing."
1.9106,"This group studies gravity physics via experimental and theoretical work on extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. The COBE detection of anisotropy of the 2.7K thermal cosmic background radiation (the CBR) shows the fluctuations are large enough to be studied from the ground and balloons. It seems likely that the character of the anisotropy on angular scales from 30 arc min to the COBE resolution at about 10 will be a strong discriminant for theories of the nature and origin of structure. Work will continue on the development of techniques to map the CBR and the analysis of theories of the origin of the angular fluctuations. The long wavelength part of the CBR spectrum is important as a constraint on the evolution of the intergalactic medium, but the spectrum is not well measured. Research will continue on a systematic approach to deal with the main experimental problem, the separation of the CBR from the emission from our galaxy. A believable theory of galaxy formation must account for the properties of the CBR, the observations of galaxies and the intergalactic medium at redshifts greater than unity, and the systematics of the distribution and motions of galaxies at relatively low redshifts. Research will continue on the development of the theoretical and numerical techniques needed to interpret these phenomena and use them as tests for the models for the development of structure in an expanding universe."
0.116,"Research in theoretical elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology will include studies of possible new particles predicted by `supersymmetry` (which relates the constituents of matter to the basic forces), the origins of the highest energy cosmic rays, the nature of the Dark Matter which makes up most of the mass of the Universe, and problems of interest concerning the four basic forces of nature. Attention has focussed recently on several ways in which supersymmetry may be hidden from discovery because the new particles related which it predicts, although light enough to be produced in existing accelerators, have very subtle signatures. Thus it is extremely important to find ways to infer their existence. The properties of the highest energy cosmic rays suggest they may in fact be new particles, whose understanding could shed light on supersymmetry as well as quasars. Quasars are objects which were especially populous in the early universe and are thought to be enormous black holes accreting the surrounding galaxy. The studies to be undertaken are important to furthering our understanding of both the cosmos and the basic forces."
0.05,"Theoretical research in cosmology will apply techniques and insights from elementary particle physics and from string theory. String theory seeks to describe all the fundamental forces of nature, but its very difficult to test at currently accessible energies. The cosmological research will include studies of the idea that the universe contains regions (`bubbles`) in which the energy density is less than the critical value needed to stop the universe from expanding forever. These bubble models are the only known predictive models for a universe with subcritical energy density, and so it is important to calculate their detailed consequences and properties to compare with the data, which will soon be good enough to determine the universe's energy density. Also, many of these subcritical models (and more general cosmological models) probe high energy scales, and thus may provide significant tests of superstring theory."
0.249979,"This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Marcia J. Rieke of the Steward Observatory, University of Arizona. The NSF Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as the potential for continued significant contributions to scientific research, the academic profession, and the education of future scientists. A period of rapid technological growth in infrared detectors for use in astronomy is allowing astronomers to address problems that could only be dreamed about five years ago. Dr. Rieke will be carrying out studies aimed at understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies. This is now possible because of the availability of infrared (IR) cameras which operate at sensitivity levels far beyond the simple photometry of the past decade. The utility of studying high-redshift galaxies at infrared wavelengths stems from the fact that the energy distribution of the electromagnetic emissions from galaxies peaks in the infrared part of the spectrum and hence galaxies appear brightest in the infrared at all redshifts. The infrared emission is sensitive to the bulk of the stellar population. Early infrared data on high redshift galaxies confirms expectations about the nature of the stars in these galaxies which of necessity were selected mainly from lists of radio galaxies. A new, more sensitive IR camera is being prepared for use, and will allow many issues associated with high redshift galaxies to be addressed. The long-standing question of whether radio galaxies are typical elliptical galaxies and hence suitable for use in cosmological work will be the primary study. Other research centering on understanding the nature of galaxies observed in deep infrared surveys will be carried out.//"

0.308213,"The goal of this collaborative project is to improve the current measurement of cosmological quantities, in particular the Hubble constant and the Dark Energy component, using time delay measurements from strong gravitational lenses acting upon quasars. This includes analysis of already taken data, as well as the anticipated discovery of approximately 50 new lenses. Gravitational time delays are not only independent of other methods but are also a very cost effective probe, requiring just a few hours on an 8-10m telescope for modeling the lens, and subsequent monitoring on 1m class telescopes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. At the K-12 level, Dr. Treu collaborates with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural history (SBMNH) and Las Cumbres Observatories GlobalTelescope Network to organize public lectures, and establish an astronomy curriculum at the UC-operated Sedgwick Natural Reserve.

0.04,"At the intersection of particle theory and cosmology lie fundamental questions. Why is gravity so different from other fundamental forces? Why is it so weak (the hierarchy problem)? What is the universe's dark energy? What drives inflation, smoothing the universe while seeding structure formation? String and M theories require extra spatial dimensions: how could they explain our perceived 3D universe? Recent work on this last question, extra dimension, illuminates all the others. In this project, the PI investigates a class of extra dimensional models: those where extra dimensions warp, or curve, around a 3-brane ? a 3D sub-universe trapping ordinary matter. Such branes are predicted by string and M theory; they warp space-time, due to general relativity; and their warp renders both gravity and particle interactions effectively 3D. The PI's work calibrates the warped particle interactions, using extra-dimensional field theory. Braneworlds thus predict a well-specified 3D universe, from one of higher dimension. Furthermore, they provide a dynamic means of dimensional reduction: a phase transition twists some field in the extra dimensions, spontaneously confining both gravity and ordinary matter, due to a massive 3-brane formed at the twisting defect?s core."

The phenomenon of weak gravitational lensing occurs when matter along the line of sight, which might otherwise be unobservable, magnifies and distorts the images of background galaxies. Dr. Seljak will make progress in this area of research by comparing his theoretical predictions to actual observations. He will make use of several observational surveys, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Deep Lens Survey.

0.918025,"The proposal is to deploy the QUEST experiment to the South Pole Station and to operate it over two austral winter seasons. The receiver and optics are already separately funded and under construction. The telescope will be mounted on the existing DASI platform, covering most of the cost of doing so using existing funds, and re-using large parts of the DASI infrastructure and control system, making this a highly leveraged proposal. QUEST is a 2.6-m Cassegrain telescope equipped with a next generation polarization-sensitive bolometer array, which will be aimed on obtaining maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. The polarization of the CMB results from bulk motions of material at the time of the plasma-neutral transition and the polarization measurements are the next frontier of CMB research, offering both the opportunity to make crucial tests of the standard cosmological model, and fresh insights which will lead beyond it. Angular scale in CMB studies is customarily referred to by spherical multipole number l, and the polarization pattern decomposed into so-called E-modes and B-modes. DASI was the first experiment to detect E-mode polarization at l ~ 300. More recently WMAP has released results on the T-E cross-correlation extending down to low multipoles and providing important new information on the reionization of the Universe. At this time a battery of experiments are either running or under construction to improve CMB polarization measurements. The experiment proposed here (which is referred below as ""QUEST and DASI"", or QUaD) will go well beyond these and is a true ""next generation"" instrument. QUaD has raw sensitivity similar to the planned Planck space mission, and in fact shares much of the same technology. However, while Planck plans to survey the whole sky, QUaD will go extremely deep on small patches selected for extremely low foreground contamination. This is the crucial difference between the two experiments - not simply that QUaD will come first by at least several years. QuaD's maps will have dramatically higher signal to noise per pixel. As the sensitivity is pushed down to microkelvin level and the multipoles up to 2000 and beyond, such maps will prove crucial to disentangling the cosmic signal from instrumental and foreground effects. In this way, it is expected that the QUaD maps will be relevant for extending through the Planck era to that of a possible polarimeter on the South Pole (8-m) Telescope and the CMBpol space mission currently under discussion. In the same way that DASI and CBI make complementary temperature measurements over different ranges in l space, BICEP and QUaD will make complementary polarization measurements. B-mode polarization at higher multipoles is confidently expected from lensing of the E-mode pattern by intervening large-scale structure. QUaD is optimized to detect this signal, making a further crucial test of the standard paradigm and constraining the neutrino mass. Inflationary gravitational waves (IGW) would generate a B-mode signal at lower l, where QUaD begins to lose sensitivity, but where BICEP is optimized to probe for this potentially very important signature of fundamental physics. The ultimate sensitivity to IGW that can be reached will depend on the extent to which the lensing signal can be removed - QUaD will demonstrate the feasibility of this proposed technique. With respect of the broader impact, the enterprise of modern cosmology is one with which almost everybody can identify. The idea that through science humans can understand the origin, nature and fate of our Universe is fascinating, and frequently featured in newspapers and general magazines. QUaD collaborators work hard to communicate this excitement by interacting with the public in both formal and informal settings. Outreach and education related to the project will be disseminated through established structures and mechanisms such as those implemented by the Center for Cosmological Physics (CfCP) at U. Chicago. These programs, which reach out to local and distant K-12 school teachers and students, will use the excitement of exploring our universe to help attract women and minorities to science. Graduate and undergraduate education and research will be integrated in the construction of the instrumentation as well as in the analysis of the data. Students will play a major role in the project, exposing them to all aspects of scientific and engineering research. They will learn valuable skills, which will aid them in pursuing their careers, whether in industry or academia."
0.627814,"Arguably, both dark energy and inflation can currently be viewed more as paradigms than theories, since a compelling, underlying mechanism for each is still to be found.

Dr. Rachel Bean (Cornell University) will establish the required theoretical tools and observational requirements to ensure that the large scale structure cosmological surveys in progress, or being developed, in the coming five years will be optimally applied to decipher and constrain the full array of signatures that dark energy and inflation can leave. The work will also detail the observational implications of tightly delineated theories of brane inflation and alternative theories of gravity that promise distinctive properties, but which have not, as yet, been studied in the necessary detail. In combination, these approaches will yield an improved insight into the physical origins of these two, major, outstanding questions in cosmology.<br/><br/>The research program to be carried out under this award actively involves training of undergraduate and graduate students. One emphasis is on increasing interaction between the Cornell Physics and Astronomy students, giving each opportunities to develop both an understanding of, and research experience in, the underlying theories and how experimental data are used to judge a theory's merit. Dr. Bean will also develop a middle-school ""Afterschool Universe"" program in astronomy and cosmology, in collaboration with the Cornell Department of Astronomy education and public outreach (EPO) coordinator.

These satellites within the Local Group include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times.<br/><br/>Extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models in order to learn how the dynamical -, merger -, assembly -, star formation -, and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems fit together in the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy for which were previously studied by the investigators. The Milky Way and M31 are both spiral galaxies but have different populations of satellite galaxies for which an explanations needs to be found. The additional data for M31 are important for evaluating solutions to the ?missing satellites problem? in Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations, where the number of subhalos is predicted to be higher than the number of observed satellites. So far the Milky Way is the only system for which the comparison to models can be made which will change when the results of this study are available.<br/><br/>The three principal investigators have a standing collaboration and they have initiated the SPLASH (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo) survey with previous support from the NSF. The methods and techniques used here are well established in this collaboration. The SPLASH survey uses the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II telescope and the 4-m telescope with Mosaic CCD wide field Imager at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The survey extends to study red giant branch stars in more satellite galaxies of the Andromeda system. The group has already 139 DEIMOS masks (about 20,000 spectra) and spectroscopy of M31 red giant candidates selected from the imaging data. The goal is to observe another 135 DEIMOS masks to obtain spectra of more than 100 member red giant stars in each of the known and any newly found dSph satellites of M31. Further spectra are thought for about 3,000 stars in M33, a low-luminosity disk satellite interacting with M31; and about 1,000 stars in the NE shelf which is tidal debris from a past M31 satellite associated with the Giant Southern Stream in M31.<br/><br/>One part of the work combines spectral and photometric diagnostics to isolate M31 red giants efficiently. Further there are measurements of precision stellar velocities to derive velocity dispersions in dwarf galaxies and tidal streams, which are both kinematically cold subsystems. Measurements of elemental abundances from moderate resolution co-added spectra tare used o constrain the chemical enrichment/star formation histories of M31 satellites. Theoretical models are used to determine the dark matter mass of each dwarf satellite galaxy in M31 to place the observations within a cosmological framework. This will give more data to decipher how the evolution of the Milky Way and M31 can be described in the context of Lambda-CDM cosmology.<br/><br/>This work provides another data set for a galaxy system to test Lambda-CDM cosmologies. This will have a broad impact on other fields. The DEIMOS-derived chemical abundances are of interest for stellar population studies community. The new analytical methods developed here provide a foundation for similar studies of resolved stars in other stellar systems, including more distant galaxies to be targeted with the next generation of telescopes.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students are participating in the research activities and graduate students work on parts of this project for their theses. This will help to train the next generation of scientists. The researchers make efforts to speak in K-12 classrooms and to reach out to underrepresented high-school and undergraduate students.

Current data on the cosmic background radiation indicate that the gas content of the universe remained mostly neutral from the time of recombination at a redshift of about 1000 to a time corresponding to a redshift of about twenty. Observations of quasars at redshifts of about six indicated that, at that time, the intergalactic medium was highly ionized. Thus this ""reionization"", the shift of intergalactic gas from mostly neutral to mostly ionized, must have happened sometime between the times corresponding to redshifts of six and twenty. Dr. Gnedin will make significant improvements on numerical methods of modeling radiative transfer with the hope of achieving numerical convergence. These models will be able to make quantitatively accurate predictions for the evolution of the intergalactic medium for the first time.

2.636218,"The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides three strong but circumstantial pieces of evidence that the visible Universe was created by the superluminal inflation of a tiny volume of space: the near isotropy of the horizon, the flatness of space, and the phase-synchronicity of acoustic oscillations in the early universe. The goal of better understanding the origins of the Universe requires probing this epoch of Inflation directly. The most promising probe of Inflation is the unique signature that the GWB imprints on the polarization of the CMB. The amplitude of this signature depends on the energy-scale of Inflation. If the energy scale is typical of Grand Unification Theory (GUT) (10^15 > 3 x 10^16 GeV), the signature may be detectable. The signature of the GWB-induced polarization is expected to be less than an rms amplitude of ~300 nK of the CMB; more than two orders of magnitude below the amplitude of the temperature anisotropies that have only recently been resolved. Detection will require only modest angular resolution (~ 1 deg.), but will require long integration (~1 year) on a restricted (~3%) and contiguous patch of sky. The six-month night, the extremely dry and stable weather, and the precise rotation of the sky about the zenith make South Pole Station the ideal terrestrial site for this ambitious project. A CMB polarimeter (BICEP) uniquely capable of detecting the signature of the GWB is now under construction and will be available for deployment to the South Pole in 2003. The team that is building BICEP includes four senior experimentalists who have successfully fielded sophisticated bolometric instrumentation to the Antarctic. BICEP will operate simultaneously at 100 and 150 GHz in order to both minimize and recognize confusion from polarized astrophysical foregrounds. At these frequencies, a modest (and thus relatively easy to deploy and maintain) 20-cm primary aperture will provide a resolution of 1deg. at 100 GHz and 0.7 deg. at 150 GHz. By combining a new polarization-sensitive bolometric detector technology developed for Planck (2007 launch) with four independent levels of signal differencing and a carefully optimized observing strategy, BICEP will reach the current limit on CMB polarization in the first hour of integration, reach the sensitivity of Planck over 1% of the sky in the first week, and precisely measure CMB polarization on the critical angular scales of 1 deg. to 10 deg. BICEP will serve the broader community of cosmologists and astrophysicists by <br/>(i) pioneering an orders-of-magnitude improvement in this exciting new field, (ii) characterizing the diffuse astrophysical foregrounds that will ultimately limit measurements of this type (and which are of direct interest to Galactic astronomers), (iii) demonstrating new technologies and methodologies that promise to be of broad importance to millimeter-wave polarimetry, and (iv) providing excellent training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in labs which have a very strong track-record in this regard. Observational cosmology is currently enjoying a renaissance that has captured the public imagination, and serves as one of the most effective vehicles for stimulating interest in science in general. Detection of the signature of the GWB in the CMB would represent a triumph of fundamental physics and cosmology that would revolutionize our understanding of the origins of the Universe."
0.380611,"The proposal is to deploy the QUEST experiment to the South Pole Station and to operate it over two austral winter seasons. The receiver and optics are already separately funded and under construction. The telescope will be mounted on the existing DASI platform, covering most of the cost of doing so using existing funds, and re-using large parts of the DASI infrastructure and control system, making this a highly leveraged proposal. QUEST is a 2.6-m Cassegrain telescope equipped with a next generation polarization-sensitive bolometer array, which will be aimed on obtaining maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. The polarization of the CMB results from bulk motions of material at the time of the plasma-neutral transition and the polarization measurements are the next frontier of CMB research, offering both the opportunity to make crucial tests of the standard cosmological model, and fresh insights which will lead beyond it. Angular scale in CMB studies is customarily referred to by spherical multipole number l, and the polarization pattern decomposed into so-called E-modes and B-modes. DASI was the first experiment to detect E-mode polarization at l ~ 300. More recently WMAP has released results on the T-E cross-correlation extending down to low multipoles and providing important new information on the reionization of the Universe. At this time a battery of experiments are either running or under construction to improve CMB polarization measurements. The experiment proposed here (which is referred below as ""QUEST and DASI"", or QUaD) will go well beyond these and is a true ""next generation"" instrument. QUaD has raw sensitivity similar to the planned Planck space mission, and in fact shares much of the same technology. However, while Planck plans to survey the whole sky, QUaD will go extremely deep on small patches selected for extremely low foreground contamination. This is the crucial difference between the two experiments - not simply that QUaD will come first by at least several years. QuaD's maps will have dramatically higher signal to noise per pixel. As the sensitivity is pushed down to microkelvin level and the multipoles up to 2000 and beyond, such maps will prove crucial to disentangling the cosmic signal from instrumental and foreground effects. In this way, it is expected that the QUaD maps will be relevant for extending through the Planck era to that of a possible polarimeter on the South Pole (8-m) Telescope and the CMBpol space mission currently under discussion. In the same way that DASI and CBI make complementary temperature measurements over different ranges in l space, BICEP and QUaD will make complementary polarization measurements. B-mode polarization at higher multipoles is confidently expected from lensing of the E-mode pattern by intervening large-scale structure. QUaD is optimized to detect this signal, making a further crucial test of the standard paradigm and constraining the neutrino mass. Inflationary gravitational waves (IGW) would generate a B-mode signal at lower l, where QUaD begins to lose sensitivity, but where BICEP is optimized to probe for this potentially very important signature of fundamental physics. The ultimate sensitivity to IGW that can be reached will depend on the extent to which the lensing signal can be removed - QUaD will demonstrate the feasibility of this proposed technique. With respect of the broader impact, the enterprise of modern cosmology is one with which almost everybody can identify. The idea that through science humans can understand the origin, nature and fate of our Universe is fascinating, and frequently featured in newspapers and general magazines. QUaD collaborators work hard to communicate this excitement by interacting with the public in both formal and informal settings. Outreach and education related to the project will be disseminated through established structures and mechanisms such as those implemented by the Center for Cosmological Physics (CfCP) at U. Chicago. These programs, which reach out to local and distant K-12 school teachers and students, will use the excitement of exploring our universe to help attract women and minorities to science. Graduate and undergraduate education and research will be integrated in the construction of the instrumentation as well as in the analysis of the data. Students will play a major role in the project, exposing them to all aspects of scientific and engineering research. They will learn valuable skills, which will aid them in pursuing their careers, whether in industry or academia."
0.075,"The objective of this proposal is to study dark energy, dark matter, and the neutrino mass by doing N-body numerical simulations of the evolution of the universe incorporating large and small scale cosmological structure formation. The simulations will incorporate future survey results as they become available. This work specifies the physical processes driving the distribution of galaxies within their halos, the halo and sub-halo mass function, the bias of halos relative to the dark matter, as well as pure dark matter statistics such as the nonlinear power spectrum and higher order statistics. Determining these quantities robustly and at high precision is necessary in order to determine the equation of state of the dark energy and neutrino mass. The presence of new physics which generates neutrino mass highlights the chance that something extremely significant may be present in the neutrino sector ? namely,it is a strong contender to be dark matter. Sterile neutrinos, predicted in most extensions to the standard model of particle physics, can be produced in the early universe and be part of dark matter. The PI proposes to improve the analysis of sterile neutrino production and their clustering and growth in order to see whether these particles are responsible for a large fraction of the dark matter in the universe. <br/>The projects presented in this research proposal will integrate research and education by training and developing graduate students through supervised research on these projects. The results of this research will be disseminated to the community on the web and in various talks given by the PI. The graduate students involved on this project would develop the skills needed to work at the forefront of theoretical astrophysics, including sophisticated computational skills."

0.6,"""This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).""<br/><br/>Inflationary cosmology, combined with recent developments in string theory, is pointing to a major paradigm shift: from a nearly homogeneous and isotropic universe to an extremely inho-mogeneous ""multiverse"", where much of the volume is still in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a finite ""bubble"" where inflation has ended, and other bubbles with diverse properties are constantly being formed. A major goal of the proposed research is to learn how this multiverse scenario can be tested observationally. All possible events will happen an infinite number of times in an eternally infllating multiverse. Unless we learn how to compare these infinities, we will not be able to make any predictions at all. This is known as ""the measure problem"". To determine the probability measure of the multiverse, different measure prescriptions will be studied to check for internal inconsistencies and for conflict with the data. Some measure candidates have already been ruled out in this way, and the hope is that there aren't that many viable prescriptions satisfying some minimal set of requirements.<br/>Another idea to be pursued has recently been suggested by Garriga and Vilenkin. They conjecture that the dynamics of the inflationary multiverse is holographically encoded at the future infinity, where it is described by a lower-dimensional Euclidean field theory. The measure is then defined by imposing an ultraviolet cutoff in that theory. This is an attractive approach, as it opens the possibility of deriving the measure from first principles. The most spectacular observational test of the multiverse scenario would be a direct observation of a collision of our bubble with another one. Observational effects of such a collision and the probability for us to be close enough to detect one will be investigated.<br/><br/>Another major topic of the proposed research is the study of the evolution and observational signatures of topological defects, which can be copiously produced at phase transitions in the early universe. The main focus here will be on cosmic string networks and on ""necklaces"", consisting of monopoles connected by strings, which are the most promising defects from the observational point of view. Numerical simulations and analytic modeling will be used to study the evolution of string networks, and the results will be used to make accurate predictions for gravitational waves, high-energy particle fluxes, and other observable effects. Detection of topological defects would open a new window into the early history of the universe and into particle physics at extremely high energies. The broader impacts are that the proposed research will be done in collaboration with graduate students and postdocs. The P.I. will continue his efforts to communicate the results to the general public. This especially applies to the multiverse worldview, which has far-reaching implications beyond physics. The PI has already written a book for lay-persons called ""Many Worlds in One"" and His work has been featured in numerous newspaper and magazine articles in US, Europe, Russia, and Japan, and in many popular books."
0.075061,"This research deals with several aspects of the relationship between quantum theory and gravitation, especially those which are relevant to understanding the origin and evolution of the universe. This work is part of a line of enquiry that seeks to better understand the effects of gravitation on quantum systems and the quantum nature of gravity. The specific research topics include: (1) The problem of the cosmological constant, a fundamental, unsolved problem in cosmology. The problem will be studied in the context of possible dynamical mechanism that force the value of the cosmological ""constant"" to decay. (2) Quantum violations of classical energy conditions (e.g. generation of negative energy densities) and their effects upon gravitation. This will study the extent to which one can produce exotic gravitational fields with quantum matter and avoid the singularities of classical general relativity. (3) The limits of validity of the semiclassical approximation to quantum gravity. This is of importance both for understanding the early history of the universe and for guiding the development of a more complete quantum gravity theory. (4) Alternative approaches to quantum field theory. This is a search for new ways of studying quantum processes, especially in the presence of gravity."

0.092,"If one looks at the biggest structures in the universe, one discovers that our ""neighborhood"", the region of space near our galaxy, is remarkably similar to other regions of similar size, located elsewhere in the universe. In fact our universe appears to be very much the same in all directions. This property is shared by the very cold radiation, discovered in 1965, which was left behind by the big-bang. To explain this fact in a way that is consistent with Einstein's theory of relativity is very difficult, and has forced cosmologists to consider a new theory of how the universe began. In this theory the universe ""inflates"" and grows very rapidly in size during a very short period of time. This project shall investigate under what conditions such a stage is consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics, which are the laws that govern matter at very tiny length scales. It shall also seek to understand better how gravitons, the light-like particles that transmit gravitational forces, are produced during such an inflationary stage, and how they could affect the appearance of the cold radiation left over from the big-bang."

0.075,"The PI has a broad research program in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The first set of his goals exploits the Pierre Auger observatory as an ultra-high-energy particle (UHE) physics laboratory. The PI intends to study the development of UHE cosmic ray (CR) cascades in the atmosphere. To distinguish between the effects of the cosmic ray composition and new effects related to novel hadronic physics, the proposed study will investigate the development of the CR cascades in the atmosphere. Another research area is for the PI to determine the flux of cosmogenic UHE neutrinos due to photomeson production (GZK effect). Once the total amount of data on UHE interactions coming from the Auger Observatory increases, the PI hopes to constrain the number of extra dimensions and probe the possibility of TeV-scale gravity (suggested by having extra spatial dimensions) by studying limits on the production rate of black holes in UHE particle interactions. Observations of the showers triggered by UHE neutrinos will be used to study neutrino interactions and mixing. By studying the development of UHE CR cascades in the atmosphere the PI hopes to identify exotic R-hadrons (standard hadronic states coupled with gluinos), if they exist and are metastable. The detection techniques of HE and VHE gamma rays have recently improved significantly allowing for much better angular resolution and sensitivity of the instruments. A cutting-edge instrument in MeV-sub TeV range GLAST, is scheduled for launch in 2008. The PI hopes to utilize the GLAST capability to shed light on the origin of gamma-ray emission. The PI also intends to study exotic particle physics at the LHC and Ice Cube: probes of quantum gravity, search for R-hadrons. He also intends to study of the ""unparticle"" parameter space which is the regime where conformal field theories at short distances can affect the physics seen at the LHC. The PI writes for several popular magazines and has appeared on BBC radio to publicize the physics potential of the Ice Cube neutrino telecope at the South Pole.

0.482605,"In a major breakthrough during PI's prior funding period, the PI and collaborator Robin Young accomplished the explicit construction and proof of the existence of nonlinear time periodic solutions of the compressible Euler equations. These solutions describe new shock-free waves that propagate through an oscillating entropy field without breaking or dissipating, and thereby give a theoretical basis for the possibility of dissipation free, long- distance signaling. The waves transmit information according to a fundamentally new mechanism---compression and rarefaction are balanced along every characteristic, the waves propagate at a new speed, (different from a shock or sound speed), and sound waves move through periods at speeds that can be commensurate or incommensurate with the period. The period determines the speed of the wave crests, (a sort of observable group velocity), but the sound waves move at a faster speed, the usual speed of sound, and this is like a phase velocity. Part I of this proposal is concerned with both the <br/>mathematical investigation and numerical simulation of these new waves. In particular, the mathematics shows that the waves can be computed by a perturbation series which is given in closed form starting from linearized solutions that display the structure of the nonlinear waves, and this is the basis for a proposed numerical simulation. Part II addresses problems of shock-wave propagation in General Relativity (GR). This includes a program to numerically simulate a physically realistic cosmological shock-wave that could arise from Guth's well known inflationary spacetime. The point of departure here is prior joint work with PI's collaborator Joel Smoller in which we introduced a physically believable, mathematically rigorous shock-wave refinement of the Standard Model of Cosmology. We propose to numerically refine this model by incorporating a more realistic equation of state and thereby resolve secondary waves in the problem. Our goal is to use this accurate simulation as a baseline for comparison with observational data. Part II also addresses shock-wave propagation and black hole formation in GR, and Part III concerns resonant interactions in classical fluids.<br/><br/>The compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics resulted from Leonard Euler's successful attempt in 1752 to complete Newton's program to give a correct version of the Newtonian laws of motion <br/>that apply to continuous media. For Euler, these equations represented the nonlinear theory of sound waves. Euler's great achievement was to derive the nonlinear equations from physical principles, and then to show that in the limit of weak signals the theory recovered D'Alembert's principle that sound waves were approximately sinusoidal oscillations in the pressure that propagate according to the linear wave equation. Thus our new construction of sound waves for the fully nonlinear equations in Part I resolves in the affirmative the most basic question one would ask about the nonlinear theory of sound waves---do the nonlinear equations support oscillatory solutions that propagate like the sinusoidal waves of the linear wave equation? Interestingly, these solutions appear to be ubiquitous, despite two centuries of work suggesting that such time periodic solutions might not be mathematically possible. The PI believes that an understanding of these new waves will have a significant impact, and may well change our point of view regarding the fundamental wave propagation mechanisms in nonlinear hyperbolic systems. When Einstein's ideas about time and space are incorporated into the compressible Euler equations, one is led to general relativity and the Einstein equations for a perfect fluid. In Part II, our proposed numerical simulation of a possible cosmic shock wave, is motivated by our idea that a secondary (rarefaction) wave, <br/>that would be reflected back from the shock in the refined model, might account for the anomalous acceleration of the galaxies within classical GR, without the cosmological constant. If our model is <br/>correct, then the universe after the Big Bang begins inside a White Hole, (the time reversal of a Black Hole in which everything is exploding outward), and eventually evolves into something similar to the late stages of a classical, localized explosion: a finite mass of bounded extent, evolving behind an outgoing shock wave, all expanding into an empty space beyond."

In this theory, the observable universe began <br/>with a shock wave explosion into a stationary (time-independent) space. This <br/>explosion created the expanding universe that astronomers observe today. <br/>The leading edge of this expansion is modeled by an outward propagating <br/>shock-wave.

In part ii) the proposer <br/>will study how solutions of the equations of Quantum Mechanics change <br/>when gravity is taken into account. Up to now, gravity has been <br/>ignored in elementary particle theory, because gravity is much weaker <br/>than nuclear forces and electromagnetism. Preliminary calculations of <br/>the proposer show that in spite of the weakness of the gravitational force, <br/>the addition of gravity into the equations has a ""smoothing""effect on <br/>solutions, and greatly modifies some aspects of elementary particle theory.<br/><br/>The proposer will do research in two areas. First, he will investigate an<br/>alternative scenario to the standard ""Big-Bang"" cosmology. In his model <br/>the observable universe began with a shock-wave explosion rather<br/>than from an incredibly dense small region the size of a grapefruit. <br/>Consistent with some recent astronomical observations of huge energy <br/>bursts in the very outer regions of the cosmos, this theory implies that <br/>there may be other distant universes which also arise from shock-wave <br/>explosions. Secondly, the proposer will study the effect that gravity has <br/>on other forces (electromagnetism and nuclear forces). Since the <br/>gravitational force is extremely weak in comparison to these other <br/>forces, physicists have ignored gravity in studying elementary particles. <br/>However, the proposer has found that the inclusion of gravity does <br/>actually play a role in elementary particle theory.

0.5,"Abstract John J. Salzer Wesleyan University Galaxies that have active nuclei, or regions of intense starburst activity, represent examples of the most energetic phenomena known in the universe. Galaxian activity is very common and occurs on all scales, from the super luminous quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), down to the extremely active star-formation regions in blue compact dwarf galaxies. Much of our knowledge of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and starburst galaxies have come by studying galaxies cataloged in objective-prism surveys which used observations by Schmidt telescopes and data recorded on photographic plates. The opportunity to use more sensitive charge coupled device (CCD) detectors to survey for emission-line galaxies now exists, and initial observations have provided results that have shown great promise to provide better data. The large, deep samples obtained from CCD-based Schmidt surveys will provide exciting new opportunities to study galaxian activity of all types, and should allow us to better understand this activity in the context of galaxy formation and evolution in general. The research will involve carrying out the next generation of objective-prism surveys for emission-line galaxies. The technique to be used combines the benefits of a traditional Qchmidt telescope survey with the advantages of using a CCD detector. It is planned to survey several hundred square degrees of sky to a limiting magnitude of B = 20 - 21 over the next five years. Computer software developed specifically for this program will be used to automatically locate, extract, and classify the spectra in each field, and use pattern matching algorithms to select our sample of emission-line galaxies. An initial pilot project, carried out in the Spring of 1994, has verified that our technique is indeed capable of reaching the desired magnitude. It is conservatively estimated that 20-30 emission-line galaxies will be found per square degree, roughly 200 times the surface density of the galaxies in the Markarian survey. The emission-line galaxy candidates will be observed spectroscopically using a multi-fiber spectrograph to obtain redshifts and line strengths for the full sample. The results obtained from analyzing the data of this deep sample of AGNs and star-forming galaxies will have numerous applications to the study of galaxian activity. These include: global star-formation processes, chemical evolution in galaxies, the value of the primordial helium abundance, luminosity functions and space densities of AGN and actively star-forming galaxies, large-scale structure and observational cosmology."

Currently each of these codes have solvers with varied performance characteristics, but all face challenges because of changing hardware architecture. Efforts underway to cope with these challenges, are largely fragmented. While it is true that the scientific codes used in various domains differ significantly from one another, many solutions are likely to be conceptually similar, even if they differ in details. The goal of the proposed conceptualization project, Software Institute for Methodologies and Abstractions for Codes (SIMAC) is to find common abstractions and frameworks applicable across a broad range of applications through cooperation, coordination and interdisciplinary interactions among the participants. The core group of participating codes includes FLASH (astrophysics, cosmology, CFD, HEDP), Cactus (CFD, numerical relativity, and quantum relativity), the code suite used by the Lattice QCD community, and Enzo (cosmology). <br/><br/>The proposed collaborative research will produce benefit beyond the four simulation codes and collaborating institutions by exploring: a common software infrastructure applicable to a broad range of science and engineering application domains; an engagement model between computer science research and application development; a multidisciplinary immersion program for research, education and training of students, postdoctoral fellows and visitors on future platform architectures."
0.32,"The research of this Career proposal focuses on the very early universe, and lies at the interface between cosmology and particle physics. Very soon various new detectors based on the land and in space will measure the parameters describing the present universe with increasingly high precision. These measurements can then be used to test theories of the primordial universe, whose properties are directly determined by fundamental physics. <br/>The interests of the PI straddle questions involving the present and initial states of the universe, and the evolutionary history that connects them. The proposal covers broad but overlapping areas of cosmology: inflationary dynamics and observational constraints, the termination of inflation and preheating, and the cosmological consequences of candidate fundamental theories. The focus will be to understand and test classes of models, rather than single, overly specific scenarios. The broader implications of this proposal concerns <br/>the development of materials to be used the new Sloan Digital Planetarium. <br/>The PI is developing a program called ""Real Time Relativity for use in the new Yale digital planetarium"". This program will create a ""Mr. Tompkins"" universe where the speed of light is slowed to the point where cars and planes would undergo significant relativistic distortions, and can also be adapted to simulate events such as particle collisions, or relativistic astrophysical phenomena. This package allows the user to interactively specify their trajectory in real time, and thus makes full use of the semi-immersive environment provided by a digital planetarium. Presentations can be tailored for use with the general public, high school students and undergraduates, and will thus significantly add to the impact of what will be a major new facility here at Yale. The ""shows"" will be made freely available, and will hopefully inspire others to explore the full potential of these systems."
0.49,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Petr Horava, Mina Aganagic, Raphael Bousso and Yasunori Nomura at Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Berkeley. <br/><br/>In the first decade of the 21st century, we witnessed a remarkable convergence of the fundamental questions about the origin, structure and the future fate of our Universe. Now, in the middle of the second decade, we experience the exciting confrontation of the fundamental theoretical questions (what is the Universe made of? what are matter, energy, space and time?, etc.) with the experimental data which are now becoming available in experimental particle physics, observational cosmology and astrophysics. These experimental findings are in turn challenging the remarkable developments on the theoretical front. The co-PIs of this award will perform fundamental theoretical research at these crossroads of particle physics, quantum gravity, cosmology and string theory, confronting the experimental challenges from beyond the Standard Model, the ideas of the multiverse, the interface of string theory and condensed-matter physics, the nature of space and time, and the mathematical implications of topological strings. Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. The significant broader impacts of this research include the training of students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists in the nation and the world. The fundamental questions addressed in this research are of deep interest to the general public, and the co-PIs will continue promoting the importance and excitement of fundamental science to the general public.<br/><br/>More specifically, Mina Aganagic will focus on the interplay of string theory and gauge theories with pure mathematics. She will study the refined topological string, the refined Chern-Simons theory and M-theory. Raphael Bousso will work on extracting predictions from the multiverse, and the interconnections of geometry, holography and information, as recently crystallized in the black-hole ""firewall"" conundrum. He will further study the string landscape and the holographic entropy bounds. Petr Horava will study quantum gravity, especially in the context known as ""Horava-Lifshitz gravity"" and its broad applications, including the puzzles of naturalness in particle phenomenology and cosmology, and implications to condensed-matter physics. He will apply methods of nonequilibrium field theory to quantum gravity and strings. Yasunori Nomura will work on ideas relevant to the recent and upcoming experiments, such as the LHC, with emphasis on supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, the origin and nature of dark matter, and the conceptual understanding of the implications of the multiverse for the TeV-scale physics. All four co-PIs will seek unexpected new opportunities for transformative interdisciplinary research in all areas related to theoretical particle physics."
0.11,"Two projects in observational cosmology will be carried out. One project is the continuing exploration of the large-scale structure of the universe, as delineated by the distribution of galaxies. A large redshift survey in the north and south galactic polar caps will be used to explore volumes approximately 500 megaparsecs across. Of particular interest will be the structures in which galaxies occur, the properties of large voids in space, and the largest scale on which the universe is inhomogeneous. Attention will be given to the question of whether galaxies are, indeed, reliable tracers of the mass distribution in the universe. The second project is the study of the evolution of stellar populations in galaxies during the last half of the age of the universe. An attempt will be made to establish whether the evolution which has been shown to occur in the members of compact clusters of galaxies is characteristic of all galaxies, or is instead, the result of some process internal to the clusters. The properties of galaxies in several different environments will be used to test for an environmental dependence of evolution. The properties of nearby spherical (SO) galaxies will be examined to ascertain if they represent the end-point of the observed evolution of galaxies."
9.082006,"Abstract<br/>AST 9978911<br/><br/><br/>In the last decade considerable additional evidence has been gathered supporting the hypothesis that at least 90% of the mass in the universe is dark: it does not emit or absorb any form of electromagnetic radiation. Understanding this dark matter has become one of the more central problems in astronomy and cosmology. A number of observations indicate that the predominant form of the dark matter is nonbaryonic, presumably in the form of elementary particles produced in the early universe. Weakly Interactive Massive Particles form a particularly interesting generic class of candidates as there appears to be a convergence between cosmology and particle physics. The direct observation of the interaction of WIMPs in a terrestrial detector would be of tremendous importance to particle physics and cosmology. The observed WIMPs would be particles that reflect physics beyond the Standard Model of strong and electroweak interactions, and the identification of these WIMPs would solve the central problem of dark matter and help us understand the evolution of the early universe and the formation of structure.<br/><br/>Because of a long development effort funded both by the National Science Foundation (through the Center for Particle Astrophysics) and the Department Of Energy, the sensor technology exists to provide a great step forward in this type of search, giving the best change for a positive result. The simultaneous measurement of the phonons and the ionization produced by the WIMP interactions provides a powerful discrimination against radioactive background, and this technique is now being utilized at Stanford, in the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Experiment (CDMS I).<br/><br/>This award, which is being supportred jointly by the Division of Astronomical Sciences, the Division of Physics, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, will support construction and operation of a second generation experiment (CDMS II) at a deep site in the Soudan mine in northern Minnesota."

1.8,"This award supports the University of Washington Eot-Wash Group to develop novel, highly-sensitive torsion-balance instruments to search for the ultra-weak forces allowed by modern ideas in theoretical physics; especially attempts to unify gravity with the other three fundamental forces. This unification is faced with two deep problems: the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other known forces, and the enormous observed disparity between the cosmological constant and the quantum-mechanical predictions of the vacuum-energy density. Theoretical ideas for overcoming these problems often predict new gravitational phenomena that can be tested with improved instruments. In particular, (1) Newton's inverse-square law will be tested down to length scales substantially smaller than the diameter of a human hair to probe for ""large"" extra dimensions and to test a possible explanation for the observed smallness of the cosmological constant. These tests should be able to probe new gravitational-strength interactions with length scales down to 25 micrometers; (2) Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle will be tested with a sensitivity 50 times better than previously published results. This will test a key postulate of Einstein's relativistic theory of gravity and will close a loophole in the ongoing Lunar-Laser-Ranging test of the Strong Equivalence Principle. It also probes speculations about the source of the mysterious ""dark energy"" that appears to comprise two thirds of the total mass-energy of the Universe; (3) A special torsion pendulum containing almost a mole of polarized electrons will be used for several novel experiments of unprecedented sensitivity including a search for CPT-violating fields frozen into the universe, a search for macroscopic CP-violating interactions, a search for macroscopic, velocity-dependent, P-violating interactions, and a search for the exotic spin-spin interactions predicted by current ideas about ""ghost condensate"" gravity; (4) A new torsion-balance instrument will be commissioned and used to search for the force produced by axion-like particles.<br/>The Eot-Wash Group has applied the techniques of experimental gravitation to address a broad variety of basic questions of interest to the gravitational, elementary-particle and cosmology communities. This research has required and produced technical innovations that have found applications in other areas such as gravity-wave detection. The Group's results are widely disseminated through publications and by colloquia, invited talks, lab tours and public lectures, and have been featured in magazine and newspaper articles in this country and in Europe. The variety of scientific issues addressed by the Eot-Wash Group and the many experimental challenges involved provide an excellent education in experimental physics for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as unusually attractive opportunities for undergraduate research projects. This award will provide support for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and several undergraduate projects."
0.28248,"Wheeler, J. Craig<br/>"" Theory and Observation of Supernovae ""<br/>AST- 0098644<br/><br/>There is a renewed interest in cosmology with the evidence that supernovae, when used as distance indicators, may point to a finite cosmological constant and an accelerating expansion of the universe. In addition, there has been a recent link between a supernova and a gamma-ray burst. Understanding the different types of supernovae has thus become more important than ever before. In this award, three major themes concerning the observation and theory of supernovae will be pursued. The first is to understand better Type Ia supernovae and their application to measure cosmological distances. This will involve observations with the Hobby-Eberly telescope and infrared spectra obtained at other observatories. The second theme is to explore the polarization of supernovae and its implications about the asymmetry of supernova outbursts. The third major undertaking will be to construct theoretical models of the magnetohydrodynamic processes involved in core collapse that may produce jets and asymmetries of the sort observed."

Reionization has numerous observable consequences on the spectrum, anisotropy and polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background, on signatures of high-redshift star and quasar formation, and on the mass spectrum and internal characteristics of galaxies. This project will use cosmological radiative transfer, gas and N-body dynamics simulations to address frontier problems in the theory of reionization and its feedback on galaxy formation in the Cold Dark Matter model, in order to predict these observable signatures. This includes (1) tests, comparisons, and standards for this aspect of computational cosmology; (2) the first large-scale radiative transfer simulations of self-regulated reionization with sufficient dynamic range; (3) the impact of small-scale structure on reionization; (4) the redshifted 21-cm background; (5) the effect of patchy reionization on CMB temperature anisotropy; and (6) the gas dynamical feedback of the first Population III stars on the second generation of star formation.<br/><br/>The work involves the pioneering development of computational methodologies and algorithms for incorporating radiative transfer in simulations.

Subsequent simulations suggest that DRPA reproduces many unique signatures of cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including their diverse and complex light curves, spectra and spectral evolution. If confirmed, this new idea suggests that GRBs are caused by magnetic-dominated, rather than hydrodynamic, explosions. This research will expand and focus PIC simulations, to construct relations between observable GRB quantities and test them with astronomical data. Current and future GRB databases will then be used to investigate progenitor and cosmological questions, including the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. This work will lead to new initiatives in particle acceleration, both cosmic and in the laboratory, and will stimulate new research on the interaction of ultra-strong magnetic fields with strong gravity in general relativity. PIC simulations can also be converted into attractive animation products for education and scientific entertainment."

0.54,"Ranging from the low-energy phenomena of cosmology to the highest energy of stellar jets, neutrinos are a fundamental ingredient of the universe that we observe, and offer unique windows into its mysteries. The purpose of this project is a theoretical study of these windows. Part of the research will be on neutrinos from core collapse supernovae: how these neutrinos are affected by flavor oscillations, and what their detection will teach us about the physics that takes place at extremely high density near the collapsed core. High-energy neutrino emission will also be investigated as a way to explore the physics of particle accelerators in our galaxy and beyond, with focus on propagation effects and detectability at present and future neutrino telescopes. Another area of study will be the physics of neutrinos in the early universe, how they connect to the nature of the dark matter, and how they can possibly reveal the existence of new particles and forces. This project will contribute to the ongoing transition to a new phase of neutrino physics, characterized by new, more powerful experiments and by a deeper understanding of the neutrino phenomenology. <br/><br/>Being based at a large public university, the project will benefit young scientists through educational activities and direct involvement in research.

These models will describe the history of the first bound objects to form from the primordial gas in the early universe. They will include the coupled evolution of the time-dependent, nonequilibrium chemical, atomic and molecular level populations as well as the nonequilibrium rovibrational level populations of the molecules with contributions due to chemical reactions in the primordial gas.

These models will compute the coupled evolution of the time-dependent nonequilibrium chemical, atomic and molecular level population, thermal, and hydrodynamic history of the first bound objects to form from the primordial gas. This will be the first time such extensive, coupled evolution models have been attempted. In addition, this project will investigate the explicit nonequilibrium rovibrational level populations of the primordial molecules with contributions due to chemical reactions, resulting in an improved determination of molecular cooling and the prediction of the emission spectra of primordial clouds. The emission spectra will be used to suggest the most likely ways these objects may be observed with the next generation of infrared space telescopes. The needed atomic and molecular data and derived cooling functions will be assembled and posted on the World Wide Web. The data that is not available, primarily involving rovibrational state-specific molecular collisions, will be computed with established quantum-mechanical techniques. The studies of the primordial gas will be extended to follow protogalaxy and protostar formation under increasing metallicity and radiation field conditions to the beginning of the era of Population II. These studies will be relevant to the interpretation and planning of future space-based observations with NGST, SIRTF, FIRST, and Astro-F and ground-based telescopes.

0.0674,"The goal of the proposed research and education is to search for dark matter particles <br/>in the halo of our galaxy, and to increase the number of female physics students at the <br/>University of Florida (UF). The motivation for the search for dark matter comes from our <br/>current understanding of the universe. Over the last ten years, a variety of cosmological <br/>observations have led to the construction of a concordance model of cosmology. In this very <br/>successful model, the universe is made of 4% baryons, which constitute the ordinary matter, <br/>23% nonbaryonic dark matter, which formed all the structures observed today, and 73% <br/>dark energy, a smooth component revealed by its effect on the geometry of the universe. <br/>Understanding the nature of the dark matter and dark energy are the most important <br/>challenges to cosmology. The dark matter could be made of so-called Weakly Interacting <br/>Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could have been produced in a very early phase of the <br/>universe. These Big Bang relics are particularly interesting because they are also predicted <br/>in particle physics theories going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. They <br/>can be detected in the laboratory by searching for nuclear recoils produced when WIMPs <br/>scatter off nuclei in a target detector. Because the predicted event rates are very low <br/>(smaller than one event per kg detector material and day), and the deposited energies <br/>are tiny, massive, ultra-low background experiments are needed in order to detect these <br/>hypothetical particles. Liquid xenon has many advantages as a dark matter detector. The <br/>high-density and high atomic number allow to build a compact and self-shielded detector, <br/>while the simultaneous measurement of the charge and light signal after a WIMP scatters <br/>off a Xe-nucleus provides an efficient method to discriminate against background noise from <br/>natural radioactivity and cosmic ray interactions. The proposed research has the ultimate <br/>goal of building a large liquid Xe dark matter experiment in an underground laboratory. <br/>A first, 10 kg liquid Xe dark matter prototype has been approved and will be installed at <br/>the Gran Sasso Laboratory in 2006. At the University of Florida, we have built a smaller, <br/>3 kg prototype, with the goal of calibrating the light and charge output of the detector and <br/>establishing its discrimination power at low energies by using a neutron beam at the UF <br/>tandem accelerator. <br/><br/>The main focus of the educational part of the proposal is to mentor female students in <br/>bridging the transition from high school to college and from college to a PhD program on <br/>physics. A series of talks will be given at local high schools with the goal of recruiting female <br/>students to UF and to a yearly 7 week summer program in which they are actively involved <br/>in research in a physics lab. A mentoring program for female undergraduate and graduate <br/>students at UF will be established. It will be organized both as small-group tutoring, by <br/>pairing one undergraduate and one graduate student and having them meet regularly, as <br/>well as in large group activities, such as monthly meetings with a female professor from <br/>UF or abroad, and social events. Such meetings, along with office hours for female physics <br/>students have been offered since fall 2004, and so far were very well attended. The ultimate <br/>goal of the educational component will be to increase the number of women who obtain an <br/>advanced degree in physics, and who will continue to have a successful career in science."
0.018,"9422216 Williams The research to be carried out will have an impact on (1) extragalactic astronomy: the structure and energy generation of quasars and other active galactic nuclei (AGN) are investigated, on (2) cosmology: the formation of galaxies in the early Universe are investigated, and on (3) a combination of galactic astronomy and cosmology: dark matter and gamma-ray bursts are investigated. The project involves theoretical, numerical, and statistical investigations. In Part I of this project, the physics of general relativistic, supermassive Kerr-Newman black holes are used to model AGN. Monte Carlo simulations of Penrose processes are used to model the extraction of energy from the ergosphere; and large scale electromagnetic fields are used to generate the jets. In Part II, electromagnetic and gravitational fields in a Friedmann cosmology are used to model the formation of supermassive stars, near the time of recombination in the early Universe. In Part III, low energy black holes of negligible emissions will be used to model dark matter in the Universe. Finally, in Part IV, black holes that undergo periods of being active and inactive are used to model gamma-ray bursters. The objective of the research is (1) to show that the Kerr-Newman black holes can explain the energy source of AGN; (2) to show how rotation, magnetic fields, and particle-field interactions can produce the necessary gravitational instabilities needed in the early Universe to allow the formation of supermassive stars of approximately 10 Million Solar masses (these stars could be the progenitors of the supermassive black holes believed to power AGN); and (3) to show that using black holes to model two poorly understood phenomena in the Universe: dark matter and gamma-ray bursts, can give promising results in explaining the nature of the original sources."
0.107189,"AST-0606975<br/>Partridge<br/><br/>The history and large-scale properties of the Universe are now well understood, mostly because of detailed observations of the fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The crucial next step in observational cosmology is the detection and characterization of polarized fluctuations in the CMB, which are unfortunately much smaller in amplitude. The present research program has two major components: to examine the polarization of inverted spectrum and gigahertz-peaked radio sources using the Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array, and to investigate the possibility that a previously undetected spectral line of neutral hydrogen (at 10GHz) might be used to investigate the epoch of reionization. The first of these will help to determine if radio sources that become prominent at high frequencies could constitute a major contaminant for future CMB polarization studies. The second is a speculative but potentially important new avenue for investigation of the early Universe.<br/><br/>The major broader impact of this research lies in the encouragement and training of undergraduate students at a predominantly undergraduate school. Haverford College, and this researcher in particular, has a fine record of sending students on to careers in astronomy and related fields, and these projects will help maintain that record.

These satellites within the Local Group include the least luminous galaxies known and they can be explored to test ideas about star formation in the smallest dark matter halos and at the earliest times. <br/><br/>Extensive data sets on the resolved stellar populations of M31 satellites are combined with state-of-the-art galaxy models in order to learn how the dynamical -, merger -, assembly -, star formation -, and chemical enrichment histories of the current and past M31 satellite systems fit together in the context of the general paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The data for M31 are compared to the satellites and halo population of the Milky Way galaxy for which were previously studied by the investigators. The Milky Way and M31 are both spiral galaxies but have different populations of satellite galaxies for which an explanations needs to be found. The additional data for M31 are important for evaluating solutions to the ?missing satellites problem? in Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations, where the number of subhalos is predicted to be higher than the number of observed satellites. So far the Milky Way is the only system for which the comparison to models can be made which will change when the results of this study are available.<br/><br/>The three principal investigators have a standing collaboration and they have initiated the SPLASH (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo) survey with previous support from the NSF. The methods and techniques used here are well established in this collaboration. The SPLASH survey uses the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II telescope and the 4-m telescope with Mosaic CCD wide field Imager at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The survey extends to study red giant branch stars in more satellite galaxies of the Andromeda system. The group has already 139 DEIMOS masks (about 20,000 spectra) and spectroscopy of M31 red giant candidates selected from the imaging data. The goal is to observe another 135 DEIMOS masks to obtain spectra of more than 100 member red giant stars in each of the known and any newly found dSph satellites of M31. Further spectra are thought for about 3,000 stars in M33, a low-luminosity disk satellite interacting with M31; and about 1,000 stars in the NE shelf which is tidal debris from a past M31 satellite associated with the Giant Southern Stream in M31.<br/><br/>One part of the work combines spectral and photometric diagnostics to isolate M31 red giants efficiently. Further there are measurements of precision stellar velocities to derive velocity dispersions in dwarf galaxies and tidal streams, which are both kinematically cold subsystems. Measurements of elemental abundances from moderate resolution co-added spectra tare used o constrain the chemical enrichment/star formation histories of M31 satellites. Theoretical models are used to determine the dark matter mass of each dwarf satellite galaxy in M31 to place the observations within a cosmological framework. This will give more data to decipher how the evolution of the Milky Way and M31 can be described in the context of Lambda-CDM cosmology.<br/><br/>This work provides another data set for a galaxy system to test Lambda-CDM cosmologies. This will have a broad impact on other fields. The DEIMOS-derived chemical abundances are of interest for stellar population studies community. The new analytical methods developed here provide a foundation for similar studies of resolved stars in other stellar systems, including more distant galaxies to be targeted with the next generation of telescopes.<br/><br/>Undergraduate students are participating in the research activities and graduate students work on parts of this project for their theses. This will help to train the next generation of scientists. The researchers make efforts to speak in K-12 classrooms and to reach out to underrepresented high-school and undergraduate students. Research results about the well-known large spiral galaxy Andromeda are well suited to be incorporated into public lectures and presentations which are given by the team members on a regular basis."

The ACT facility - a 6m off-axis Gregorian telescope, detectors, and infrastructure - has had two successful seasons of science observations during 2008 and 2009. The awarded project is a follow-on program, called ACTPol, to greatly increase the number and sensitivity of the detectors, and to add linear polarization capability. ACTPol will upgrade and extend instrumentation on the existing telescope, which is located on Cerro Toco (17,030') above the ALMA site on the Chajnator Plateau in Northern Chile. It will address important questions in both basic physics and astrophysics, and if successful will perform transformative research. The program will run for five years. A new bolometer camera with polarization sensitivity will be constructed and used with the ACT for the following science goals: 1) Constrain the initial conditions of universe and measure ""running"" of scalar spectral index with k; 2) Measure spatial curvature of the universe and dark energy; 3) Discover or constrain the sum of the neutrino masses; 4) Measure the amount of primordial helium; 5) Determine the growth rate of structure; 6) Complement the Planck satellite on smaller angular scales; and 7) Enable future large-scale B-mode polarization measurements.<br/><br/>ACTPol will continue to pursue the types of broader impacts already successfully undertaken by the ACT project.

They will be undertaking research on string field theory and string geometry. String theory is the central focus of most current effort in fundamental theoretical particle physics. The proposed activity focuses on three essential aspects of string theory, i.e. string field theory (SFT), geometrical and topological aspects of string theory, and the AdS/CFT correspondence. Concerning string field theory, it is proposed to use the Moyal Star Formulation of SFt to construct the supersymmetric theory and develop non-perturbative computational techniques that would help to estimate the true vacuum state and connect the string theory to low energy physics and cosmology. The finding of the true vacuum state in string theory is one of the most relevant open questions in this area of research. In addition, the connection of string theory to low energy physics and cosmology is an essential point to test the predictions of string theory. It is also proposed to continue the current research on applications of topogical string theory to understand perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of superstring compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds as well as of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories arising as limits of these compactifications. These ideas have important implications, as the computation of gravitational corrections to the superpotentials, which are realized in the gauge theory in a novel fashion, leading to an interesting Lorentz violating photon-graviton coupling, with possible astrophysical consequences. In addition, there are very important applications in mathematics. The third aspect of the research involves the AdS/CFT correspondence, which has been one of the central issues of string theory in the last years. This activity is very important to advancing knowledge and understanding in string/M theory. <br/><br/>This project brings together the efforts of three laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. Results of the research will impact the areas of string theory, particle physics and cosmology. The expected broader impact of the proposed activities would be in mathematical areas of non-commutative geometry, group theory, and geometry. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. The project includes the participation of a large number of postdocs and graduate students. Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals."

0.5298,"A broad set of research projects concerning galaxies, quasars, gravitational lenses, clusters of galaxies, and globular star clusters will be carried out. Although substantial theoretical research will be done, the primary thrust is observational. The theoretical programs are attempts to understand, model, or predictbasic observational results.

It is hoped and believed that such an improved understanding will provide critical insights into the properties of the Universe as a whole, that is the cosmology of the Universe. The specific projects are intended to provide 1) a detailed model for infall dominated galaxy formation, 2) a direct determination of the nature of galaxy evolution in faint clusters, 3) a statistically useful sample of gravitational lenses, 4) detailed observational studies of known lens systems, 5) a detailed study of the properties of distant clusters of galaxies, 6) a determination of the quasar luminosity-redshift distribution near the cutoff, 7) a clear determination of the nature of the remarkable quasar pair 1146+111B, C 8) detailed dynamical and population models for several well studied globular clusters, 9) a sample of faint variable objects located by an automated survey, 10) an elucidation of several detailed aspects of the internal dynamics and interactions of galaxies, and 11) a model of the effects of Malmquist biases on the extragalactic distance scale and determinations of peculiar velocity fields."
0.368793,"AST 0206299<br/>Cen<br/><br/>The formation and evolution of cosmic structures, including galaxies, clusters of galaxies and large-scale structure, are fundamental problems of modern cosmology. While the Big Bang picture of how the Universe began is generally accepted, the details of how and when structures developed and formed are in hot debate. On scales larger than clusters of galaxies (>10 million light years across) it is generally believed that gravity is the dominant force and structures grow from small initial seeds planted in the very early universe (<< 1 second since the Big Bang), because gravity is attractive and unstable. However, on smaller scales gas hydrodynamics, microphysics (i.e., forces on atomic scales) and star formation processes play progressively more important roles in shaping and determining when galaxies form and how they evolve; the picture at these smaller scales is much less clear. The radiation field, especially, the ultra-violet radiation that is capable of ionizing atomic hydrogen must play a very important role in these processes. In particular, it determines when atomic hydrogen is fully ionized and the universe is cleared of hydrogen ""fog"" and becomes transparent to distant sources. This epoch has been characterized as the ""end of the dark ages"". Since radiation controls the evolution of the thermodynamic state of the gas, a fraction of which is subsequently incorporated into stars, it is essential to include radiation hydrodynamics in full detail in cosmological computer simulations in order to provide answers to many of the important questions in modern cosmology. This is a formidable task to tackle even with the fastest supercomputers today. Dr. Cen and his collaborators have developed an efficient way to compute this complicated situation and begun to carry out a program that should help provide some clues about how the radiation field and the matter evolve with time.<br/>***"
0.465142,"AST-0707731<br/>Spergel<br/><br/>This project is an international collaboration between Princeton University and Institut d'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain) to develop statistical tools to analyze data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), an NSF-funded telescope in the Atacama Desert of Chile. The techniques, although tuned to the ACT data, will be useful for analyzing any high-resolution Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiment. The first measurements made with these tools will be the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the microwave background, and mass fluctuations along the line-of-sight. By combining simulations and analytical theory, the research group will compute the full covariance matrix and its inverse, and compute the likelihood of the observed values for diverse cosmological models. Applying these techniques to the ACT data will improve measurements of the mass density of the Universe, the density of atoms, the properties of the dark energy, and the properties of the neutrino.<br/><br/>Measuring dark energy and dark matter provides insight into fundamental physics and the fate of the universe. Measuring CMB fluctuations and the growth of structure opens a window to the earliest moments of the big bang. These results will likely be of broad popular interest, even as this research trains undergraduate and graduate students in widely applicable statistical techniques, and engages them in a substantive international collaboration. Releasing the user friendly likelihood software along with the data will help a broad group of cosmologists, astrophysicists, and particle physicists."
1.8403,"The outstanding Princeton research group will carry out a broad program of theoretical and experimental work on extragalactic astronomy, cosmology and the physics of the early universe. Among the topics to be studied are: 1. Sky maps of the 2.8 K cosmic background radiation. This can better test theories but requires new techniques, considerably larger experimental efforts, and better observing sites. 2. The long wavelength part of the 2.8 K CBR. Measurements at 10 to 50 cm wave lengths require detailed treatment of radiation from the galaxy, but the results would be invaluable for tests of theories of the origin of perturbations to the spectrum. 3. Observational studies of galaxy formation. An experiment designed to measure fluctuations in the sub-mm background may detect young galaxies with high star formation. Proposed X-ray observations of rich clusters at redshifts z ~ 1 are a critical test of the biased cold dark matter theory. 4. Theoretical studies of the evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. A new numerical technique should be well suited to the study of the primeval mass fluctuations needed to produce observed structures by gravity. The numerical renormalization group method will be used to study evolution from fractal primeval density fluctuations. Semi- phenomenological theories of the origin of the large-scale structure of the universe will also be explored."

The Special Issue on Space and Cosmic Plasma will provide an update on research in space plasma physics in the areas of magnetospheric/ionospheric interactions, the magnetospheres of the planets and stars, and the physics of plasma effects related to other astrophysical objects. Special emphasis is placed on laboratory and computer simulation of space plasmas and the application of these results to outstanding problems such as dynamical processes, energy transport, diagnostics, plasma diffusion in the magnetopause, nonlinear interactions, particle acceleration, double layers, critical ionization velocity effect, electric currents, and instabilities in the near-Earth plasma environment. The goal of the Second IEEE Workshop on Plasma Astrophysics is to provide an update on research in space plasma physics in the areas listed above for the Special Issue.

Such work is important in testing the validity of the currently accepted Standard Model of elementary particles, as well as providing tools for the anticipated discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model.

1.1394,"A broad range of observations-from galaxies and superclusters to distant supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background radiation, all giving consistent results-tells us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter would be of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, high-energy particle physics, and our understanding of gravity. A leading hypothesis is that dark matter is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, an elementary particle beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, but predicted in various extensions, such as supersymmetry. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their local density in our region of the Milky Way potentially makes them detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.<br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration, supported jointly by NSF and DOE, has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to distinguish the rare scattering of such WIMPs on nuclei from the prominent electron interactions from radioactivity. Using our powerful technology in the Soudan mine, with our high background rejection, CDMS is currently (July 05) the most sensitive WIMP search experiment in the world, by a factor of ten. <br/>The two years of funding provided by this award, will mainly support the operation of CDMS II at Soudan in order to extract the best science possible from the five towers of six detectors that we now have installed. Taking over from the CDMS II funding in January 2006, this NSF base funding will allow Berkeley to participate in the extension of CDMS running till June 2007 and in the analysis of the data collected. This should allow us to multiply our raw exposure by roughly a factor twenty and improve our current sensitivity by a factor ten. Berkeley's emphasis will remain the optimization of the detector performance and continuous performance monitoring, improvement of the electronic noise and further development of discrimination methods. The base funding will also support a modest effort of detector characterization in the laboratory, which will believe will become increasingly necessary to demonstrate the discrimination level reached in our analyses.<br/>We will also devote approximately 20% of the base funding to R&D for the future stages of CDMS. This second component is essential in maintaining the CDMS leadership worldwide and prepare for extrapolation to larger masses. The Berkeley effort will be divided between the development of the cold hardware for the detectors of the phase A of SuperCDMS (25kg total target mass), the test of phase A detector prototypes produced by Stanford and the study of kinetic inductance phonon sensing for the phase B or C of SuperCDMS (150 kg target mass or more).<br/>This proposal will partially support the research of three graduate students. Our education and outreach activity will focus on the improvement of the displays for the science tours at Soudan and on the apprenticeship program for East Bay High-School students. For the latter program, we have entered into collaboration with the SMASH summer academy, which supports academically high school students from underserved backgrounds. Based on last years pilot program involving one of their 9th Grade students in our laboratory, we are planning to have two student apprentices per year over the duration of this award."

Toward the same end Kachru and Silverstein will continue to investigate mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking, including distinctively stringy ones. They will also explore mediation mechanisms and other aspects of model building that are natural in string theory. Cosmology and especially inflation is a central interest of the Stanford group.<br/>An important topic will be to better understand metastable vacua in string theory and more generally the structure of the string landscape. This will include ideas building on the KKLT (Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, Trivedi) construction and work of Silverstein and collaborators. Linde, Shenker and Susskind will continue to study the puzzling phenomenon of eternal inflation. These studies will include work on the measure problem and on holographic definitions. Kachru, Kallosh and Linde will continue their efforts to build stringy models of slow roll inflation and to study the phenomenological<br/>constraints on the gravitino mass and gravity wave production. Linde and Susskind will study the phenomenological consequences of a relatively small number of e-foldings of slow roll inflation. Shenker and Silverstein will continue to study resolutions of spacelike singularities like the big bang and the black hole singularity in the context of string theory. Dimopoulos will continue to explore how atom interferometer techniques can be used to construct novel gravity wave detectors and implement sharp tests of General Relativity.

0.047668,"At the intersection of particle theory and cosmology lie fundamental questions. Why is gravity so different from other fundamental forces? Why is it so weak (the hierarchy problem)? What is the universe's dark energy? What drives inflation, smoothing the universe while seeding structure formation? String and M theories require extra spatial dimensions: how could they explain our perceived 3D universe? Recent work on this last question, extra dimension, illuminates all the others. In this project, the PI investigates a class of extra dimensional models: those where extra dimensions warp, or curve, around a 3-brane ? a 3D sub-universe trapping ordinary matter. Such branes are predicted by string and M theory; they warp space-time, due to general relativity; and their warp renders both gravity and particle interactions effectively 3D. The PI's work calibrates the warped particle interactions, using extra-dimensional field theory. Braneworlds thus predict a well-specified 3D universe, from one of higher dimension. Furthermore, they provide a dynamic means of dimensional reduction: a phase transition twists some field in the extra dimensions, spontaneously confining both gravity and ordinary matter, due to a massive 3-brane formed at the twisting defect?s core."
3.295,"The PIs on this group proposal intend to work on the following projects. Grossman plans to study different aspects of flavor physics. This includes traditional probes like B meson, D meson and K-meson physics, but also new ones, like top production and decays, and flavor aspects of physics beyond the standard model. Csaki and Perelstein plan to focus their attention on understanding the structure and signatures of models of electroweak symmetry breaking and of hierarchy stabilization, including supersymmetric, extra-dimensional and little Higgs models. Once the LHC experiments start, they expect to focus on theoretical interpretation of the data, with the ultimate goal of determining the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. They will also work on issues at the interface of particle physics and cosmology, aiming to understand the implications of the LHC data for cosmological questions such as the nature of dark matter and the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition. In string theory, McAllister and Tye propose to study certifications that result in stabilized moduli, and to use<br/>these setups to find realistic implementations of inflation in string theory. This provides a rigorous framework for resolving theoretical issues in inflation, and also provides the best prospect for experimental constraints on string theory. McAllister and Tye will pursue both aspects of this connection. Lepage proposes to use lattice simulations to finnd theoretical predictions for B and D meson physics observables at the few percent level, some of which will be compared to forthcoming results from CLEO-c. Kinoshita is proposing to calculate the eighth and tenth order QED contributions to the lepton g - 2,<br/>which will enable the most precise determination of the fine structure constant and also give the most stringent tests of QED.

0.15,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Marcelo Gleiser and Robert R. Caldwell at the Dartmouth College.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable scientific discoveries of the last decades is that our universe has a history: it emerged from a hot and dense initial state some 13.7 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since. As is the case with archeologists, modern cosmologists seek clues left over in the present to study the past. In particular, cosmologists seek to uncover the fundamental laws that govern the origin of matter and the evolution of material structures -- from atoms to stars and galaxies -- in the universe. Current observational evidence indicates that the rate at which our universe expands has passed through two anomalous periods when its rate accelerated dramatically: one within the first moments of its existence, and another in current times. The proposed research focuses on both periods of anomalous ultrafast expansion. During the first period, known as cosmic inflation, a fundamental open question is how the universe transitioned from the ultrafast expansion to a more moderate expansion rate. The answer is implicitly related to the mechanism that caused this fast expansion. As it ended, matter was explosively created and complex material structures emerged. Models describing the emergence of these structures and their properties will be developed, and their impact on the cosmic history will be investigated. The second period of fast expansion is believed to have been fueled by the still unknown ""dark energy."" The research outlined here will attempt to elucidate the fundamental properties of dark energy using techniques from high-energy physics, linking fundamental theory to observational evidence.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professors Gleiser and Caldwell will involve graduate and undergraduate students in their research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field. They also intend to give public lectures on their research results, and write articles and essays in the popular media about cosmology and some of its cutting-edge ideas. Both are active in the public understanding of science through their articles in magazines and newspapers, their appearances in TV documentaries, and also as a blogger for National Public Radio (Gleiser)."

The second is to determine what kinds of observations and experiments would be needed to definitively conclude that the dark energy is simply a cosmological constant. The third focus is how one might detect cosmic superstrings, which may arise in superstring inflation and could be abundant today. Explicity we will perform a numerical simulation of the binding of two cosmic strings to form a lower energy state, an incompletely understood process that is crucial to the evolution of cosmic string networks.

The proposed research is at the interface between fields: the application of string theory to gauge theories; and the interface between gravity, cosmology and particle physics. This proposal suggests a new model for the strong interactions motivated by string theory which makes predictions for particle spectra and interactions. This proposal also suggests new approaches to some of the outstanding problems of particle physics and cosmology, namely the nature of CP violations in the strong interactions, the source of supersymmetry breaking, and the proper interpretation of the dark energy which seems to fill the universe. Some of this physics will be tested experimentally in the near future. In addition, this proposal suggests a formal study relating phenomenologically interesting gauge theories to much simpler matrix models."

This system produced the largest territorial polity to emerge in the evolution of civilizations (the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries) as well as the largest-scale economy (the Silk Road network) before present-day globalization. This project will address fundamental questions in theory, methodology, and data concerning human and social dynamic responses to social and environmental challenges in Inner Asia and the Eurasian world system over the past 4,500 years. The interdisciplinary team includes expertise from the social sciences and computational sciences, including political science and international relations, archaeology, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, economics, applied mathematics, and computer science. This project also includes international collaborations with experts on Inner Asian archaeology and ethnography as well as European experts on computational models of empire dynamics and Silk Road network simulations. The researchers will use diachronic data from written sources and from three archaeological projects situated along a north-south transect spanning the Mongolian steppe zone as well as object-oriented, agent-based computer models that build upon and extend extant computational social science models to generate the emergence of multi-scale networks over space and time.<br/><br/>The new concepts, models, and data integrated by an computational theory that builds on earlier theories of social evolution will advance basic understanding of human and social dynamics by synergizing disciplines and themes that normally do not interact: anthropological archaeology, political economy, and computer science. Results from this project will have multiple broader impacts in areas of surviving severe social challenges faced by contemporary human communities, such as global change, terrorist violence, or cultural conflicts. These are domains where collective action responses and intelligent organizational coordination are essential for human and social survival on multiple scales. Teaching impacts will include interdisciplinary scientific frameworks that exploit disciplinary excellence and computational models for generating emergent social complexity. Social computer simulations also are expected to provide innovative and insightful experimental laboratories. Possibilities will exits for shared training opportunities for U.S. and Mongolian students.

This study will use high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations to analyze the absorption by carbon, silicon, oxygen, and nitrogen ions in a sample of high-quality quasar spectra covering redshifts two to five. This will yield metallicities, relative abundances, and their scatter, as a function of density and red shift, which will constrain the shape and evolution of the ultraviolet ionizing background radiation, the initial mass function, and the type of source responsible for the enrichment. Observed absorptions will be compared directly to realistic spectra from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, both to test those simulations, and to constrain the effect of feedback on the IGM, the role of red shift-four galaxies in the enrichment of the IGM, and the allowed presence of metals in warm and hot gas.<br/><br/>As well as stringently testing cosmological simulations, the basis for a vast array of theoretical work, this research will develop broadly useful tools, train students, and afford ample opportunities for public talks and other educational outreach."

Studies show that the Quasars (QSOs) have many high redshift absorption lines from elements heavier than Helium in their spectra. Most current theories indicate that the chemical elements which give rise to these absorption lines must have been made in stars formed after the Big Bang (the so called Pop III stars). Yet when observed in quasar spectra, these absorption lines show that the metal enriched gas must be in clouds which lie between us and the QSOs.<br/>The goal of this project is to try and understand the role of this gas in galaxy formation in the early universe, at high redshift. This program is designed to complement traditional studies of galaxy formation where the emphasis has been more on the formation and fate of the stars in galaxies during the early merger or clustering process. Over the past decade, cosmological hydrodynamic computer simulations have shown that most of the early stages of galaxy formation (in particular the ""dark"" ones, before stars started to shine) can be observed using the absorption lines which they form in the spectra of background QSOs. The velocity structure of these lines shows infall of gas and protogalactic fragments, from the turnaround of perturbations in the intergalactic medium, as well as stellar feedback into the gas and the gasdynamics of the high redshift interstellar medium itself.<br/>The aim of this program is to use the observed properties of these low density, high ionization absorption lines to understand the relation between galaxies and gaseous inflows and outflows at high redshift. The statistics of the observed absorption systems (to be obtained from several large telescopes) will be interpreted with the help of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic -simulations. The clustering properties of metal lines on large scales will be used to trace the high redshift large scale structure at densities much lower than those probed by bright high redshift sources (e.g. radio galaxies, QSOs, Lyman-break galaxies). Absorption line profiles will be examined to determine the kinematics of the gas, and attempts will be made to identify the precise origin of the gas phases revealed by various metal absorption lines and to directly observe the infall of matter into forming galaxies. Observations of absorption systems in very close multiple lines of sight to lensed QSOs will help to quantify the density and velocity structure of the metal enriched gas near the potential wells of young galaxies. Measures of the turbulence of the gas will decide to what degree the surprisingly widespread metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium is a recent process or the result of an ancient Population III phase of starformation.

3.4065,"Scientists are now confronted with many very large high-quality data sets. The potential scientific benefits of these data are offset by the laborious process of analyzing them to answer questions and test theories. This project will develop new data mining algorithms in pursuit of the goal of computer assisted discovery. Two key issues in achieving this are computational efficiency and autonomy. If scientists are to focus their energy on understanding, answers must arrive in minutes rather than days, hence the need for efficiency. Autonomy is important both from the data mining and the statistical perspective. Detailed searches for relationships, models, and parameters are too large for humans to undertake manually. New statistical methods will have to autonomously and quickly select models, test their significance, and report the results to search algorithms looking for new discoveries.<br/><br/>The National Virtual Observatory (NVO) currently under construction is a model of the future of science. The NVO will assemble petabytes of data from many multi-wavelength sky surveys into a single repository. The new methods to be developed will be implemented in the domain of cosmology, but they will be applicable to all other sciences. <br/><br/>The members of this project are computer scientists, physicists and statisticians who have a track record of collaborating closely. Working together they have produced: new algorithmic theory, new statistical theory, and publicly fielded software packages resulting from the theory, while developing new courseware and training students.<br/><br/>This proposal involves research and education in the following areas:<br/><br/>Nonparametric data analysis. Nonparametric statistical models enable powerful analysis techniques that make minimal assumptions, which is critical for scientific accuracy.<br/><br/>Automated discovery. Statistical models can be used directly for discovery. Individual objects are compared to models to identify anomalies and data generated models are compared to theoretical models to refute or confirm hypotheses.<br/><br/>Computational methods for fast analysis. The project will build on past successes of getting orders of magnitude speedups on operations such as Expectation Maximization based clustering and n-point correlations to make the new methods fast.<br/><br/>Automated simulation parameter searching. Using all of the above methods, a system will be developed that starts with a parameterized simulation and some observational data. The system will search the space of parameters, testing the resulting simulation against the real data using nonparametric methods to determine the best settings."
0.284284,"Dr White will use analytical modeling, informed by a series of large, high precision N-body simulations, to better understand dark energy and the growth of structure in the cosmos. When their distances are estimated from their redshifts, galaxies on large scales appear to be more strongly clumped along the line of sight than in the tangential direction. This 'redshift distortion' depends on both the gravitational attraction between the galaxies and the effect of dark energy in accelerating the cosmic expansion. In General Relativity, the redshift distortion depends on the same combination of cosmological parameters as does weak gravitational lensing, but in other theories the two dependences differ. Dr White will use different underlying theories of gravity to run cosmological N-body simulations, then 'observe' these, to explore how redshift distortions can best be used in testing alternatives to General Relativity. He and his team will also develop a perturbation theory to follow galaxy clustering into a mildly nonlinear regime, where the velocity perturbations are no longer strictly proportional to the density fluctuations. The project will address outstanding issues in the interpretation of surveys, the modeling of redshift space distortions, and the connection between galaxies and dark matter.<br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained through participating in the research. Tests of General Relativity have broad implications throughout physics and astronomy.

0.1,"This project, funded under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mechanism, is an exploratory study of the polarization pattern of the cosmic microwave background radiation at South Pole station in the 1999-2000 austral summer season and the following austral winter. The project involves the installation of a new sensor system in an existing telescope, and the development of an observing protocol. <br/><br/>The cosmic microwave background radiation is the remnant of a cosmological event that occurred approximately 300,000 years after the big bang when the expanding and cooling universe could no longer sustain undifferentiated plasma. The on-going, and successful, search for small temperature differences in the background radiation (anisotropies) implies that the primordial plasma was in fact not totally homogenous, but that differences existed, which would have induced gravitational waves whose expression (today) exists in the curl of the polarization field of the background radiation. It appears that the analysis of this field is currently the only way of obtaining any information about the state of the universe prior to the 300,000-year event.<br/><br/>The polarization of the microwave background is an extremely active area at the forefront of cosmology with several major investigations under way, and has great significance since the results should better constrain the fundamental cosmological constants, and define our thinking about the evolutionary state of the universe."

These models will describe the history of the first bound objects to form from the primordial gas in the early universe. They will include the coupled evolution of the time-dependent, nonequilibrium chemical, atomic and molecular level populations as well as the nonequilibrium rovibrational level populations of the molecules with contributions due to chemical reactions in the primordial gas.

These models will compute the coupled evolution of the time-dependent nonequilibrium chemical, atomic and molecular level population, thermal, and hydrodynamic history of the first bound objects to form from the primordial gas. This will be the first time such extensive, coupled evolution models have been attempted. In addition, this project will investigate the explicit nonequilibrium rovibrational level populations of the primordial molecules with contributions due to chemical reactions, resulting in an improved determination of molecular cooling and the prediction of the emission spectra of primordial clouds. The emission spectra will be used to suggest the most likely ways these objects may be observed with the next generation of infrared space telescopes.

0.160002,"ABSTRACT <br/>AST 0098515<br/>Miralda-Escude<br/><br/>High resolution spectroscopic observations of quasars often show multiple emission-line and absorption-line features which are identified as the resonance line of Lyman Alpha (Lya ) which originates in clouds of hydrogen gas at different redshifts located between the observer and the quasar itself. These redshifted Lya lines can be used to map structure in the high-redshift universe (since the redshift gives position along the line of sight). This theoretical research program will show how correlations along multiple lines of sight in the observed Lya absorption lines and correlations between different tracer populations (such as narrow absorption lines, emission lines from diffuse hydrogen, and broad absorption lines) can tighten cosmological constraints and elucidate the physics of quasar and galaxy formation. The research will use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, collisionless N-body simulations, and numerically calibrated analytic approximations to obtain predictions of current theoretical models, which can be tested against observational studies of multiple tracer populations in the same spatial volumes. In sum, the proposed research program will provide the theoretical development needed to motivate, design, analyze, and interpret multi-tracer studies of high-redshift structure.<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"
0.069,"AST 95-29225 PI: Lev Kofman Inflation and the Origin of Matter in the Universe According to inflationary cosmology, all the elementary particles which we see now were not present at the moment of the Big Bang, but were created by the decaying scalar field at the end of the inflationary stage. The process of creation of matter during the decay of the scalar field and the subsequent process of thermalization of the created particles is called reheating. The theory of reheating is still incomplete, and is interrelated with the dark matter problem. Recent studies by the PI and his colleagues have discovered more efficient methods of reheating which have important implications for cosmological models. For example, standard inflation theory results in a flat universe (Omega = 1); with different reheating parameters, a different distribution of density fluctuations may result, with a different amount of dark matter. Since current observations produce densities well below those of a flat universe, the amount of dark matter can be critical in establishing whether inflation theory does indeed hold. The PI intends to investigate the production of elementary particles when the new reheating methods are allowed for, and to examine the influence of the cosmological constant on the models with the new reheating methods, using an analytic approach."
0.659914,"The proposal is to deploy the QUEST experiment to the South Pole Station and to operate it over two austral winter seasons. The receiver and optics are already separately funded and under construction. The telescope will be mounted on the existing DASI platform, covering most of the cost of doing so using existing funds, and re-using large parts of the DASI infrastructure and control system, making this a highly leveraged proposal. QUEST is a 2.6-m Cassegrain telescope equipped with a next generation polarization-sensitive bolometer array, which will be aimed on obtaining maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. The polarization of the CMB results from bulk motions of material at the time of the plasma-neutral transition and the polarization measurements are the next frontier of CMB research, offering both the opportunity to make crucial tests of the standard cosmological model, and fresh insights which will lead beyond it. Angular scale in CMB studies is customarily referred to by spherical multipole number l, and the polarization pattern decomposed into so-called E-modes and B-modes. DASI was the first experiment to detect E-mode polarization at l ~ 300. More recently WMAP has released results on the T-E cross-correlation extending down to low multipoles and providing important new information on the reionization of the Universe. At this time a battery of experiments are either running or under construction to improve CMB polarization measurements. The experiment proposed here (which is referred below as ""QUEST and DASI"", or QUaD) will go well beyond these and is a true ""next generation"" instrument. QUaD has raw sensitivity similar to the planned Planck space mission, and in fact shares much of the same technology. However, while Planck plans to survey the whole sky, QUaD will go extremely deep on small patches selected for extremely low foreground contamination. This is the crucial difference between the two experiments - not simply that QUaD will come first by at least several years. QuaD's maps will have dramatically higher signal to noise per pixel. As the sensitivity is pushed down to microkelvin level and the multipoles up to 2000 and beyond, such maps will prove crucial to disentangling the cosmic signal from instrumental and foreground effects. In this way, it is expected that the QUaD maps will be relevant for extending through the Planck era to that of a possible polarimeter on the South Pole (8-m) Telescope and the CMBpol space mission currently under discussion. In the same way that DASI and CBI make complementary temperature measurements over different ranges in l space, BICEP and QUaD will make complementary polarization measurements. B-mode polarization at higher multipoles is confidently expected from lensing of the E-mode pattern by intervening large-scale structure. QUaD is optimized to detect this signal, making a further crucial test of the standard paradigm and constraining the neutrino mass. Inflationary gravitational waves (IGW) would generate a B-mode signal at lower l, where QUaD begins to lose sensitivity, but where BICEP is optimized to probe for this potentially very important signature of fundamental physics. The ultimate sensitivity to IGW that can be reached will depend on the extent to which the lensing signal can be removed - QUaD will demonstrate the feasibility of this proposed technique. With respect of the broader impact, the enterprise of modern cosmology is one with which almost everybody can identify. The idea that through science humans can understand the origin, nature and fate of our Universe is fascinating, and frequently featured in newspapers and general magazines. QUaD collaborators work hard to communicate this excitement by interacting with the public in both formal and informal settings. Outreach and education related to the project will be disseminated through established structures and mechanisms such as those implemented by the Center for Cosmological Physics (CfCP) at U. Chicago. These programs, which reach out to local and distant K-12 school teachers and students, will use the excitement of exploring our universe to help attract women and minorities to science. Graduate and undergraduate education and research will be integrated in the construction of the instrumentation as well as in the analysis of the data. Students will play a major role in the project, exposing them to all aspects of scientific and engineering research. They will learn valuable skills, which will aid them in pursuing their careers, whether in industry or academia."

The nature of these missing components is one of the most fundamental mysteries in physics. The leading candidate for the invisible ?dark matter? is a subatomic particle left over from the big bang known as the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). Such particles are also predicted by supersymmetry, a favored class of new particle models. If WIMPs exist, they are also the dominant mass in our own Milky Way. Although they only rarely interact with conventional matter, they should nonetheless be detectable by sufficiently sensitive detectors on Earth through their direct interaction with, and the ensuing recoil of, nuclei in a target material. The primary challenge in detecting them is reducing natural and cosmogenic radioactivity by up to 10 orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) collaboration has assembled a team to carry out an ambitious program of constructing and operating a 300 kg total, 100 kg fiducial mass, dual-phase xenon detector. A large detector is required to not only set an improved sensitivity limit, but also to accumulate WIMP statistics in a reasonable time if a signal is detected. The LUX design emphasizes using simple technologies, in particular for the design of the cryostat and the use of a water shield, to scale to large size as rapidly as possible. Thus the LUX program will develop the technologies required for 1-10 ton dark matter detectors. <br/><br/>This award provides support for the Case group to carry out its responsibilities in the LUX program. The group has a crucial role in LUX, being responsible for the cryostat and cryogenics, coordinating the integration and surface test program at Case, removing Kr from Xe, and screening parts for Rn emanation. They also have a small but active R&D program, aimed at technologies needed for a next-phase, very large-scale experiment.<br/><br/>Among the broader impacts, the techniques themselves can be further scaled up and applied to other fundamental experiments such as double beta decay and solar neutrinos. As with other particle detection techniques, new methods of position sensitivity and particle discrimination may give rise to new medical diagnostic techniques, or applications to Homeland Security and nuclear control."

0.324,"AST 0098731<br/>Tytler <br/>In the last few years, astronomers have shown that supernovae (SN), in distant galaxies are fainter than expected. The obvious explanation is that they are farther away than we had thought. If true, this implies that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. This change in expansion is attributed to a so called ""vacuum energy"" by theoretical physics. This discovery presents both major new opportunities, and a long list of troubling basic new questions. Up to now Gravity has been the hardest part of physics to understand, in part because it has been described by a single number: the Newtonian gravitational constant G which measures its strength. If the universe is speeding up there must be a second number, which should help us understand gravitational physics. In this way, astronomical observations are redefining our understanding of fundamental physics and the universe as a whole. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to provide an independent check of the claim that 70% of the energy density of the universe is some form of mysterious vacuum energy. Astronomical observations are the only way to explore the vacuum energy experimentally, because the effects are significant only over exceedingly large distances. In particular, this project will provide an independent check of the results from supernovae by using angular size as a distance measure. The amount of clumping of the gas between the galaxies will be measured both along the line of sight, and in angle across the sky. The relationship between the two measures gives the distance and hence the acceleration of the universe. The method is insensitive to changes in the state of the universe over long times. The project is urgent, because the vacuum energy remains an unconfirmed, though very plausible, result, and highly significant, because we will have the sensitivity to decisively rule out the amount of vacuum energy suggested by the supernovae, if none were present. <br/><br/>In addition to providing an independent check on the SN decelerating universe measurement, this project will also give improved measurements of the clumping of gas between galaxies at early times. This clumping is believed to have arisen from primordial quantum fluctuations when the universe was young.. These fluctuations have been measured at different epochs, and in different ways. However, the methods used in the present project will give the only measurement of the amount of clumping of matter on galaxy sized scales at early times. These new data and simulations will be compared with theoretical predictions, to act as a check on recent investigations which suggest that our present ideas about the growth of small scale structure in the universe are inadequate.

Proposed research of Friedman and collaborators will advance understanding of problems in gravitational-wave astronomy and allied areas of general relativistic astrophysics.<br/>(1) Tools developed with support of the previous grant will be used in the construction of initial data and quasiequilibrium sequences of neutron stars and black holes, following two related approaches: Solutions with helical symmetry of the full Einstein equation (with equal amounts of ingoing and outgoing radiation) and a waveless approximation in which second time derivatives of the metric are neglected in constructing solutions. (2) Work on the inspiral of a small black hole orbiting a supermassive black hole seeks to generalize a renormalization prescription to gauges tied to solutions to the Teukolsky equation and to compute the self-force on a point-mass. (3) Several additional problems involve oscillations and stability (dynamical and gravitational-wave driven instabilities) of rapidly rotating relativistic stars and of accretion tori about black holes.<br/>Postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and REU undergraduates will gain numerical and analytical expertise in leading problems in general relativistic astrophysics. Results of research<br/>will be broadly disseminated in lectures, a book in progress on rotating relativistic stars, and popular talks."
2.633953,"9514797 Hall This proposal deals with a wide range of problems in high energy theoretical physics, but there are several themes. One avenue is to explore new formulations of the basic tools of quantum field theory with which one describes the interactions of elementary particles. Possible generalizations are proposed and some new facets of string theory are considered as well. String theory is an attempt to arrive at a unified description of all interactions including gravity. There are formidable mathematical obstacles in obtaining such a formulation: some of these are addressed in the proposal. A second avenue is to attempt a more phenomenological description of the interactions of elementary particles, in particular incorporating supersymmetry, the proposed but as of yet unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. Several models are discussed and their predictions for high energy experiments are detailed. The links between phenomenological models and underlying string theories are another subject of this proposal as are the predictions of models for phenomena in the early universe and for cosmology. ***"

1.082408,"The Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA project, (""ALFA"" is the name of a new seven-beam radio camera: the Arecibo L-band Feed Array) at the 305-m radio telescope in Puerto Rico is an ongoing cutting-edge survey which will map approximately 17% of the entire sky. Upon its completion in 2010, approximately 20,000 extragalactic neutral-hydrogen line sources will be found. This survey is the deepest, highest resolution blind extragalactic neutral hydrogen survey ever conducted over a comparable area of the sky. The Principal Investigator and his team lead the survey, which is organized as an open collaboration and based on principles of enabling maximal scientific return and engaging the broadest community of researchers. The Virgo Cluster is a top target in the survey area, which makes the project potentially even more interesting as it is likely that important new structures may be found. <br/>Graduate students are involved in all phases of the project, helping to plan and execute the observing program, developing software for data processing and analysis, and producing public data products, as well as undertaking their own science projects.

0.55321,"High-energy gamma-rays are used to study the most extreme objects in the Universe, such as pulsars, black holes at the center of active galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts. Cosmic gamma-rays can also be signatures for new physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. Studies with very-high-energy gamma rays, above about 100 gigaelectron volt (GeV), require ground-based detectors with thousands of square meters of collection area. This research will use the VERITAS imaging Cherenkov telescope array in southern Arizona to study gamma-rays with energy greater than about 100 GeV. The sensitivity of VERITAS is more than an order of magnitude better than previous generation instruments operating in this energy range and has just been improved further by a substantial upgrade. <br/><br/>With this award the University of California - Santa Cruz group will use VERITAS to explore the extreme behavior of the two most powerful known classes of gamma-ray source: gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. The detail mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts and the role they play in other high-energy phenomena are still being explored. Learning whether they are capable of creating very-high-energy gamma-rays will constrain gamma-ray burst models and properties of the burst environment. Similarly, measurements of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from active galactic nuclei probe properties of the jets, providing crucial information about the particles being accelerated and how the acceleration works. Data from across the electromagnetic spectrum will be gathered and used to assemble the most complete possible picture of very high-energy gamma-ray behavior. These data will also be used to study gamma-ray absorption by collisions with the extragalactic background light, a process that tests cosmological models of star formation and galaxy evolution.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Graduate and undergraduate students play an important part in this research effort. Research experiences will also be made available to aspiring science teachers in the Cal Teach program and in-service teachers through a new Lick Observatory Teachers Institute. The researchers interact with the California State University to foster undergraduate interest in research and graduate education. There is an important interplay between the VERITAS data and data from other wavelengths, particularly X-ray and lower energy gamma-ray data from satellite missions such as Swift and Fermi. More can be learned from both types of data used together than from either alone."
0.661815,"Clusters of galaxies are important probes of cosmology and are key players in unraveling the mysteries behind galaxy formation and evolution and the development of large scale structure in the Universe. These galaxy clusters are teeming with activity as the recurring infall of dark matter dominated halos drives large scale winds, shocks, turbulence and entropy discontinuities in the intracluster medium (ICM). The diffuse, hot ICM, comprising about 90% of the normal cluster matter, carries the imprint of the recent cluster assembly history, provides a cosmological mass metric through its dynamical/thermodynamical state, transports metals and entropy, transforms galactic star formation, and offers a laboratory into basic fluid and plasma processes in low density media. Relativistic, nonthermal plasmas produced by cluster-wide processes and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) serve as an important tool for understanding the ICM's evolving dynamical state. Exploiting this tool requires a rich observational base, a good understanding of the physics of the interactions between thermal and nonthermal plasmas, and effective ways to translate between that physics and observations. To that end, the investigators have designed an ambitious, coordinated theoretical and observational program that will leverage major technical advances in both numerical simulations and telescope systems.<br/><br/>The aims of this project include a much improved understanding of (1) how large scale flows and turbulence are established in the ICM and evolve from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, (2) how magnetic fields develop and then reveal and feed back to ICM evolution, (3) how relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) are both products of and diagnostics for the dynamic ICM, and (4) how AGN outflows physically interact with the ICM and serve as diagnostics of local flows.<br/><br/>Educationally, this project includes training of undergraduate and graduate students in both cutting-edge science and the development of innovative data analysis and numerical simulation techniques. The investigators will also be active in public education, including work with the local planetarium, K-12 science and community groups."
0.36,"We study the dynamics of canonical quantum gravity in a variety of 1+1 dimensional model systems including spherically symmetric gravity coupled to fields in four dimensions and the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger black holes. Among the techniques used are recently developed local gauge fixings, loop quantum gravity treatments, and a new paradigm for dealing with the dynamics of totally constrained theories that we have been developing over the last few years. The paradigm consists in constructing discrete theories such that the continuum theory of interest arises as a well defined limit. It has points in common with that of lattice gauge theory, where discrete theories are used in a limiting procedure to define a continuum theory of interest. This approach has already been applied successfully in some situations where the space-time has some spatial dependence (i.e. more complicated than homogeneous cosmologies) but without genuine degrees of freedom, most notably providing a characterization of the complete space-time of a non-singular loop quantum gravity black hole. We propose here to extend it to richer models with dependence on one spatial coordinate. The models include complex phenomena like the one discussed by Choptuik in gravitational collapse and at the quantum level can accommodate Hawking radiation. We also continue our investigation on the role of using physical clocks and rods in describing quantum mechanics, to apply high performance computing techniques to loop quantum cosmology and to explore astrophysical implications of loop quantum gravity effects in the evaporation of primordial black holes.<br/><br/>This research fits within fundamental physics, the area of research that concerns itself with how the laws of physics fit together. In this case the laws of gravity that rule the large scales of the universe with the laws of quantum mechanics that describe the microscopic world. Sometimes by understanding how the laws of physics fit together remarkable insights can be achieved that lead to practical applications far beyond what anyone could have envisioned. Apart from the intrinsic research aspects, broader impacts of this proposal are aiding in the creation of human resources in US physics through the training of a postdoctoral researcher and the possibility that the techniques introduced here may have applicability in other areas of science and engineering as well. In addition to that, various outreach activities for the general public are planned that will help not only disseminate the results of this proposal but those of the community of physicists working on the subfield of loop quantum gravity as a whole."
0.4,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Marc Kamionkowski and David E. Kaplan at Johns Hopkins University. <br/><br/>The aim of particle physics is to understand the fundamental laws of physics and the rules that govern the behavior of all physical systems in the Universe. The traditional avenues for progress in this endeavor have over the past century been experiments at particle colliders, the most recent such experiment being the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a major international collaboration with significant US participation. Another avenue has been to use observations of astrophysical systems, as well as the Universe as a whole, as a laboratory for fundamental physics, as these cosmic systems must also obey the laws of physics. In their research, Professors Kamionkowski and Kaplan aim to develop new hypotheses about the fundamental laws of physics and to develop analytic tools to capitalize fully, in our effort to uncover new physical laws, upon the nation's investment in collider and cosmic experiments. Research on this subject advances the national interest by promoting the advancement of science in its most fundamental direction. It also advances the national interest by attracting young talent to STEM fields and providing them with powerful analytic tools in order to drive the type of innovation that drives economic progress. This project will also have broader impacts through the training of graduate students who will serve as apprentices in the research. Professors Kamionkowski and Kaplan also intend to be engaged energetically in public education through public lectures, films and videos, online tools, and popular articles.<br/><br/>More technically, Prof. Kamionkowski will explore models for dark energy inspired by the string axiverse. These dark-energy models often involve not only axion-like quintessence fields but also other fields that may have small but subtle dynamical effects in the early Universe. Prof. Kamionkowski will explore a suite of techniques based on measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy surveys, as well as assorted searches for axion-like fields, to search for evidence of these dark-energy models. Kamionkowski also plans to study new ideas for dark matter. The implications of these limits for direct and indirect detection and the implications for CMB fluctuations, CMB spectral distortions, and 21-cm fluctuations from the dark ages will be explored. Prof. Kaplan plans to explore new approaches to the hierarchy problem in which a scalar field tunnels between vacua, thereby exploring a vast range of values for the Higgs mass. The convergence of the scanning to our Higgs mass is a consequence of a back reaction due to the scanning of negative as well as positive mass-squared. Prof. Kaplan will also develop a tree-level model of flavor of the Froggatt-Nielsen variety which could reproduce the Standard-Model fermion spectrum and would make predictions for flavor-changing neutral currents at future b-quark factories or tests of lepton-flavor violation. In addition to the training of students, numerous Broader Impacts of this project are envisioned. Kaplan will tell additional stories of particle physics with remnant footage from his recent film, ""Particle Fever""; serve as advisor to several other science films and TV shows; and prepare a set of brief online physics tutorials. Kamionkowski will remain active as a public spokesperson for CMB science, do editorial work for prominent science journals, and serve on several advisory committees. Both Kamionkowski and Kaplan participate in the Johns Hopkins Quarknet program which engages Baltimore-area high-school teachers and students in cutting edge research."
1.046264,"This award will fund the continuation of a successful survey of white-dwarf supernova explosions (called ""Type I"") at telescopes in Arizona and Chile. The main goal of the work will be to compare low redshift (nearby) supernovae with their high-redshift (distant) counterparts, especially through observations in the infrared which can reduce the effects of dust. Under earlier funding from NSF, this group has assembled a large and homogeneous set of Type I supernovae light curves and spectra, developed original methods for using them using advanced statistical techniques, and addressed problems of cosmic expansion such as local flows, the Hubble constant, cosmic acceleration and the nature of the dark energy.<br/><br/>The project is expected to advance the study of dark energy, which makes up most of the universe.

0.12,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sergey Dubovskiy at New York University.<br/><br/>The accelerated expansion of the Universe, first observed in 1998, is one of the most surprising discoveries in fundamental physics over the past several decades. Currently, the two most successful theoretical explanations of this observation are either that the laws of gravity change at cosmological distances, or that our Universe is randomly selected from a huge number of universes with different vacuum energies and laws of physics. Definite evidence favoring either of these two proposals will not only have crucial impact on our current picture of the Universe, but may even affect our understanding of the kinds of physics questions which may be amenable to traditional investigations. In his research, Professor Dubovskiy aims to develop methods to test these two alternative scenarios observationally and to develop new ideas capable of explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe. One critical component of his work is to study the String Axiverse scenario --- a recent proposal by Professor Dubovskiy and his collaborators which describes how the existence of alternative universes may acquire observational support if a plethora of ultra-light particles (""axions"") are discovered in our own Universe. An especially intriguing possibility being investigated by Professor Dubovskiy is to use the ongoing observations of astrophysical black holes as a tool to discover the axions predicted in the axiverse scenario.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Dubovskiy will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in the fundamental physics. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, including those aimed at high-school students, and develop new course curricula based on the most recent theoretical and observational results in particle physics and cosmology."
1.262865,"This proposal covers many interrelated topics aiming to answer truly fundamental questions in theoretical physics. Among them: what is the correct gravity theory at large (cosmic) distances? What is quantum gravity? What is its energy scale? How (in)distinguishable are black holes? What is the origin of and solution to the hierarchy problem? The group consists of four theorists who work both separately and together on these fundamental questions. <br/>Porrati intends to undertake a systematic study of general theorems on interacting high-spin particles, both massive and massless. He proposes to extend previous results on back-reaction effects of gravity to understand their effects at short and large distances. He will work with G. Dvali and G. Gabadadze to understand the dynamics of IR modified gravity as well as of standard General Relativity. Porrati will use his expertise in string theory, and his past work on the AdS/CFT duality to study simpler,<br/>potentially soluble models of quantum gravity in lower dimension.<br/>Gabadadze is planning to approach the cosmological constant problem, and the issue of cosmic acceleration within the paradigm of large distance modification of gravity. He will: search for brane induced gravity models that lead to an accelerated expansion. <br/>Sirlin plans to continue his studies of several aspects of precision electroweak physics and related concepts in Quantum Field Theory, and to pursue the search of signals and bounds for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Dvali's research will focus on identifying and studying the new physics beyond the Standard Model, both in cosmology and particle physics. He is interested in how the dynamics behind the mechanism of stabilizing the weak scale will have consequences for LHC physics (such as, for example, production of mini black holes). He is also interested in theories of gravity that provide new physics at long distances, that on the one hand could explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and on the other can have testable experimental consequences.<br/>The PIs are involved in working with the NYU School of education on various outreach projects. They also give popular lectures, serve as liaisons with Latin-American students and write popular science articles."
0.16,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sergey Dubovskiy at the New York University. <br/><br/>Effective field theory has proven to be an extremely successful and powerful framework for describing a wide range of phenomena from particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider to the growth of density perturbations in cosmic fluids. However, it is challenged by two dramatic breakdowns of dimensional analysis---the incredible smallness of the vacuum energy and of the Higgs mass, compared to the characteristic scale of gravity. With the hope of helping to resolve these puzzles, Professor Dubovskiy aims to enrich the effective field theory toolbox with new sophisticated techniques and to come up with and test new radical theoretical ideas beyond the traditional framework. At the same time he will be looking for new observational probes, which may provide new hints on the origin of the Higgs mass and the vacuum energy. The research of Professor Dubovskiy will cover a broad spectrum of physical phenomena, ranging from the superradiant instability of astrophysical black holes as a tool to discover new particles to the dynamics of flux tubes, responsible for the confinement of quarks. <br/><br/>The research that will be funded covers not only a wide range of topics in high energy theory and cosmology, but has an impact throughout the Physics Division. For example, studies of the vacuum structure of string theory has led Prof. Dubovskiy to propose a new type of particle related to the axion, which would constitute the dark matter. Studying the interactions of this dark matter with black holes has led to extraordinary experimental signatures, ranging from astrophysical studies of black hole masses to specific gravitational wave signatures that are in the range accessible to the Advanced Large Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). These will be studied in detail. There are also substantial interrelations with atomic physics and with nuclear physics. One of the other projects will contribute to understanding the dynamics of flux tubes, which hold quarks together in the nucleon.<br/><br/>The award will also fund community outreach activities. Professor Dubovskiy will contribute to the development of the NYU Science Communication Workshop program, which helps train a generation of scientists in effective communication with the public, and the award will support numerous scientists. He also will give presentations on particle physics and cosmology at a local high school.

What is the dark energy? Do dark matter and dark energy interact with each other? Why is the abundance of dark matter about equal to that of ordinary matter, when in conventional theory they are unrelated? Indeed, why is there any ordinary matter left in the Universe at all? Are there more dimensions than the 3 we live in, and what can we say about their structure and properties? In particular the PI will develop a semi-analytic cosmic ray shower simulator (SENECA). <br/>A new candidate for dark matter (the H-dibaryon) which is based on the existence of light gluinos will be studied. The research will include a detailed and intensive examination of the consequences of coupling dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) through a dependence of DM mass on a quintessence field.

0.105,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Sarah Shandera at Pennsylvania State University. There is excellent, if indirect, evidence that our universe underwent an early period of very rapid expansion (inflation) which set the stage for the evolution to the cosmology we currently observe. Although we expect that inflation can be explained in terms of particle physics, we do not yet have a precise understanding of the nature of the particles responsible. Particle interactions can be constrained by the way they induce couplings in observable properties of the cosmic density field on different scales. This research project examines the implications of coupling between scales that are observable to scales that are outside of our current cosmological window. In particular, the PI will study how observations made in a finite volume of the universe constrain particle physics models of inflation which make predictions about statistics in a much larger, unobservable, volume. The PI will also develop workshop modules for elementary and high school students based on the theme of understanding the size and dynamical evolution of the universe. <br/><br/>The PI has already shown that when the curvature inhomogeneities on very different scales are coupled, our observed universe is likely to have biased statistics compared to the mean predicted for a larger post-inflationary volume. In other words, there is a new source of cosmic variance in comparing observations in our Hubble volume to theory. Through this grant, the PI proposes to further develop the framework for constraining interacting inflation theories, compatible with observations in a finite universe. She will map out the extent to which the cosmic variance from coupling to superhorizon modes can add new uncertainties in comparing measurements of the primordial scalar curvature inhomogeneities to predictions from theory. She will work out which qualitative aspects of particle physics scenarios for inflation can be mimicked or obscured by cosmic variance."
0.01,"This award supports the research of Wafic Sabra, from the American University of Beirut (AUB).<br/><br/>After the success of the unification of the fundamental particle interactions within the standard model, the most pressing question in theoretical physics has since been the unification of the laws of quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity, as well as the incorporation of quantum gravity with the other fundamental forces in a unified theory. Superstring theory is the leading candidate for a consistent finite theory unifying quantum gravity with the other forces of nature. The phenomenology derived from superstrings may have relevance to the problems encountered in the study of the black holes, particle physics and cosmology. In recent years, a new picture has emerged pointing to the existence of a fundamental theory, M-theory. Many theories behave very nicely if there is a small parameter, since one can perturbatively expand in this parameter and make sensible predictions. This new fundamental theory behaves like string theory at the perturbative level, but at the nonperturbative level, in which there are no small parameters, it has a rich structure of symmetries connecting perturbative aspects of string theory to nonperturbative states. This project will study gravitational backgrounds in these theories, focusing on black holes in higher numbers of dimensional backgrounds. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will make it of benefit to both physicists and mathematicians working in fields related to string theory and differential geometry. It will also help in the development of the graduate programs in physics and mathematics at AUB, and in introducing students to the frontiers of research, particularly in the various fields of high energy physics. <br/><br/><br/>M-theory behaves like string theory at the perturbative level, but at the nonperturbative level has a rich structure of duality symmetries connecting perturbative excitations to solitonic states. A major development is the equivalence between string theory on anti-de Sitter spaces and certain superconformal Yang-Mills gauge theories living on the boundary of these spaces. This equivalence gave more importance to the study of gravitational anti-de Sitter configurations as they provide a tool to the study of quantum gauge field theories important for particle physics. The main focus of Sabra's supported research is: a) The study and the classification of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gravitational backgrounds in various spacetime dimensions and in particular the search for black rings in gauged supergravity models. b)The study of gravitational instantons and their relation to integrable models, Einstein--Weyl structures and black holes in higher dimensions as well as the interpretation of Euclidean supergravity solutions in terms of string and M-theory. c) The development of our understanding of the nonperturbative theory underlying string theory, and incorporating this in the study of the phenomenological implications of string theory to gravitational physics, particle physics and cosmology"

0.225667,"Dr. Jonathan Pober is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Washington. This project involves observations to understand the formation of the first galaxies in the Universe. This period of cosmic history, called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), occurred when emission from the first galaxies fed back into the intergalactic medium (IGM) and ionized it. The Fellow is a developer of the NSF-funded Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), an experiment to detect a radio signal from the EoR. Ultimately, measurements of 21cm radio emission from both the EoR and other epochs offer a unique, 3-dimensional cosmic probe with the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cosmology as the cosmic microwave background has done in the past two decades.<br/><br/>Experiments like PAPER have been limited so far by the intrinsic faintness of the cosmological 21cm signal, and the presence of significantly brighter astrophysical foreground emission. This project will benefit from recent developments in infrastructure and data analysis to overcome these obstacles, and it may offer the first meaningful constraints on the nature of the galaxies responsible for reionization to come from observations of the 21cm line. Because the first generation of results from PAPER will be low signal-to-noise, the Fellow will support his principal analysis with a campaign to investigate systematic effects in 21cm EoR experiments to maximize the scientific impact of these measurements. His collaboration with sponsoring scientist Miguel Morales at the University of Washington will provide access to data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), another array targeting a detection of the EoR signal. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component. The fellow will take over the development of the Gamma-ray Burst All-Sky Spectrometer Experiment (GASE), a unique resource for the educational component of this program. GASE is an interferometer designed to detect low-frequency (30 MHz) radio emission from a gamma-ray burst (GRB). GASE is currently being commissioned by a team of community college transfer students, recruited and trained as part of an NSF CAREER award (AST-0847753). These students begin working on GASE prior to transferring, and as a result, they develop a network of support and mentoring relationships to help fight against ""transfer shock"" and increase their retention rate. The fellow will take over direction of the GASE project and be the principal supervisor for these students. He will also lead them to develop the GASE system, including a new correlator to enable continuous observations. The fellow's ultimate vision for the project is for GASE to be deployable at multiple institutions and for it to be a hands-on, education-focused interferometer that until recently was beyond the reach of most undergraduate physics and astronomy departments."

This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a cosmic gravitational-wave background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale of Inflation. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with an amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor to scalar modes, r = T/S. Many slow-roll models of Inflation produce r ~ 0.01?0.1, corresponding to peak CMB fluctuations of 30?100 nK rms on degree angular scales. Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey described the search for the CGB as ""the most exciting quest of all"", and emphasized that ""mid-term investment is needed for systems aimed at detecting the (B-mode) polarization of the CMB"". In 2005, the Task Force on CMB Research identified this as the highest priority for the field and established a target sensitivity of r = 0.02. The ongoing BICEP/BICEP2/SPUD series of experiments is dedicated to this science goal. They began operating at the South Pole Station (Antarctica) in 2006 and are relentlessly mapping an 800-deg2 region of the sky that uniquely low in Galactic foregrounds - the so-called Southern Hole. The combined sensitivity at 150 GHz (now greater than that of the Planck spacecraft) is concentrated on the Southern Hole increasing the ability to detect the CGB significantly. This award will support for three years the science observations and analysis with a new CMB polarimeter called BICEP3 - a third-generation compact refractor that will represent another breakthrough in per-receiver sensitivity. BICEP3 provides a further ten-fold increase in optical throughput compared to a single BICEP2/SPUD receiver. Populated with 2560 TESs at 95 GHz over three years of observing, BICEP3 will produce the most sensitive degree-scale CMB polarization maps of 95 GHz of any current or planned experiment. BICEP3 observations, when combined with SPUD's deep 150 GHz and 220 GHz coverage, will provide significantly more powerful discrimination between CMB polarization and Galactic foregrounds. Detection of the CGB would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB was to the Big Bang. Indeed its impact might be even broader, as Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science."
0.16,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary ""dark matter"" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/><br/>This award will fund an integrated research and educational program centered on the search for dark matter. Partnerships with a local minority public high school and the Adler Planetarium will genuinely engage students, educators, and the broader public in the mystery of dark matter and the status of current research, via regular classroom visits, field trips, mentoring, teacher immersion experiences, and in-the-museum programming. This will have a deep and broad impact, directly reaching teachers, planetarium staff, hundreds of URM students, and thousands of museum visitors (hundreds of thousands indirectly). The research program offers excellent opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students, making them part of a cutting edge project in fundamental science.<br/><br/>This award will allow the PI to contribute to XENON1T, a direct detection WIMP experiment deployed at the Gran Sasso laboratory built underneath the Apennine Mountains in Italy (LNGS), in the assembly, commissioning and early operations of the detector, scheduled for summer 2015. The PI also plans to develop refined analysis strategies which are expected to enhance the performance of the ionization/scintillation identification methods that are exploited in XENON1T to suppress the dominant ã/â background. To achieve this goal, the PI will make a series of dedicated measurements with a small-scale xenon detector designed to collect pure samples of nuclear and electron recoils. This will permit an exhaustive investigation of the ionization and scintillation processes that govern low-energy interactions in liquid xenon. These data, which are not easily extractable from XENON1T directly, will then be used to increase the sensitivity to WIMPs through improvements in the calibration and rejection of backgrounds."
0.640669,"Technical Abstract<br/>The Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) project seeks to detect hyperfine emission from neutral Hydrogen (21 cm rest wavelength) in the intergalactic medium about 100 million years after the Big Bang (redshifts 16-40). A detection would deliver the first observational constraints on models of structure formation and on the formation of the first stars and black holes in the Universe. LEDA will develop and integrate signal processing instrumentation into the new first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). This comprises a large-N correlator serving all 512 dipole antennas of the LWA-1, leveraging a packetized CASPER architecture and combining FPGAs and GPUs for the F and X stages. Iterative calibration and imaging will rely on warped snapshot imaging and be drawn from a GPU-enabled library (CUWARP) that is designed specifically to support wide-field full polarization imaging with fixed dipole arrays. Calibration techniques will include correction for ionospheric refraction and direction dependent dipole gains, and exploration of pulsar data analysis to improve performance. Accurate calibration and imaging will be crucial requirements for LEDA, necessary to subtract the bright foreground sky and detect the faint neutral Hydrogen signal. From the computational standpoint, LEDA is a O(100) TeraFlop per second challenge that enables a scalable architecture looking toward development of radio arrays requiring power efficient 10 PetaFlop per second performance. Stage two of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA2) is one example.<br/><br/>Lay Abstract<br/>When did the first stars form? These stars are expected to be much more massive than the stars that are around us today. Did supermassive black holes form at the same time, earlier, or later? One of the great challenges of cosmology today is the study of these first generation objects. Their formation is widely hypothesized to have begun about 100 million years after the Big Bang, but no data are available to test this theory. The only available means to study the Universe at so young an age (just 1% of what it is today) is via electromagnetic radiation from the intergalactic medium between the stars and black holes. Today, this is hot and ionized plasma, but in the early Universe it was a vast reservoir of cold neutral Hydrogen gas that fed the formation of the first stars and black holes and radiated long wavelength radiation copiously.<br/><br/>The LEDA project seeks to apply frontier radio astronomical techniques to make the first detection of this signal. LEDA will build a ""radio camera"" for deployment to the Long Wavelength Array, a radio telescope in New Mexico whose first 100m-diameter aperture was recently completed. The LEDA camera will combine several innovative technologies and data analysis techniques, giving students and young scientists the opportunity to join in cutting-edge science and development of the most advanced tools. In particular, LEDA will harness the massive computing power and flexibility of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) - the engines that power video games - to make instantaneous images of nearly the whole sky at up to 10 meters wavelength (10 million times longer than visible radiation).<br/><br/>From these images the light of our and other galaxies will be subtracted with high accuracy, enabling a search for signals from the dawn of the Universe. LEDA will push the frontiers of cosmology while contributing groundwork for future radio astronomical facilities where massive computing and signal processing systems will be lynchpins. Cross-disciplinary outgrowths of the LEDA effort will benefit astronomical, computational and solar sciences."
0.6237,"The discovery of dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics and elementary particle physics. A broad range of observations from galactic to cosmological scales indicate that nearly 90% of the matter in the universe is made up of some new type of particle, different from ordinary matter. This type of matter has revealed itself only through gravity and is referred to as ""dark matter"" because it neither emits nor absorbs light. A leading hypothesis is that the dark matter is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced shortly after the Big Bang from annihilation of ordinary matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter then they will make up a spherical halo around the Milky Way and be detectable through interactions with atomic nuclei in a suitably massive and sensitive detector. This award will further the search for WIMPs by supporting work on the LUX (Large Underground Xenon) dark matter experiment that is currently operating in the Homestake Mine in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. This award will also support development of the followup LZ (LUX-Zeplin) experiment, with a proposed mass of seven tons. The search for dark matter has been driven by the development of radiation detectors with ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. These detectors are also playing a role in neutrino physics, and have the potential for security, medical and industrial applications. Work on LUX and LZ provides excellent and unique opportunities for student training with technical skills that can be used in careers in basic research or in the private sector. <br/><br/>Using 250 kg of actively monitored liquid xenon, the LUX experiment is now at the vanguard in the search for dark matter. The upper limit on the interaction rate between WIMPs and ordinary matter that is now established by LUX rules out new regions of parameter space, and provides solid evidence that claims of WIMPs in the low mass region around 10 GeV are likely due to instrumental effects or unidentified backgrounds. With the next few years of operations and analysis it will become clear whether WIMPs will be detected in LUX or new upper limits set. In either case, LZ will be well positioned to follow up and continue the search with sensitivities 1000 times better than LUX's current limit."
0.459314,"Distant clusters of galaxies are important probes of cosmology and are key players in unraveling the mysteries behind galaxy formation and evolution and the development of large scale structure in the Universe. Any clusters that are confirmed at very great distances add significantly to the few that are known. This project employs a unique method for identifying new, distant clusters of galaxies, and this sample of distant galaxy clusters will help in determining the epoch of galaxy formation, in studying the galaxy populations of clusters over time, and in constraining cosmological models including dark energy. <br/><br/>Clusters usually contain bright elliptical galaxies near their centers, and these galaxies host supermassive black holes in their cores. Accreting supermassive black holes produce jets and lobes detected in the radio, and these jets and lobes become distorted as they interact with the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). These distortions sometimes result in the lobes being bent in the same direction, resulting in a wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology. Significant groundwork has been laid in studying the cluster environments of WATs at low-to-moderate redshifts. In addition, a large sample of 653 WATs with cluster environments too faint (and therefore distant) to be studied with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been assembled. All of these objects are being observed in the infrared with Spitzer. Based on cluster association rates at lower redshift z, this project's sample is expected to reveal approximately 400 new clusters at z > 0.7. Follow-up deep optical imaging is the next step in the survey and will be achieved using the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT). By the nature of their selection, all the clusters will contain radio-loud active galaxies, allowing the study of active-galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback at high redshift. Poor, low-mass clusters at high redshifts are particularly important for studying AGN feedback and for constraining models of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. High-redshift, low-mass clusters are also the most difficult ones to find using other cluster survey techniques, making this survey particularly useful because it will locate distant clusters with a wide range of masses.<br/><br/>Research results of this project will be included in undergraduate classes. Students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels will be involved with all aspects of the project. The Principal Investigator (PI) will mentor undergraduate and graduate students, who will accompany the PI on observing trips to the telescope. The PI will engage the community through public elementary school visits and collaboration on science museum exhibits. Students and the PI will participate with public outreach efforts with the Discovery Channel, including films and online science reporting."

The focus in this project will be on two promising ways forward. One will be to use observations of gamma-rays towards the luminous satellites of the Milky Way in order to constrain or detect weak-scale thermal dark matter. Weak-scale thermal dark matter is the most widely studied dark-matter candidate and is motivated by particle-physics models at the high (electroweak-scale) energies currently being probed at the Large Hadron Collider. The other way forward will be to develop simplified models to describe dark-matter halo density profiles in the presence of significant self-interactions and compare to observations. As part of the project, the PI will provide a map between these preferred models and the underlying particle-physics models in which such phenomenology is realized. <br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The PI will develop a cosmology and particle-physics cluster for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (i.e., the ""COSMOS Program"" at UC Irvine). COSMOS is a program for motivated high-school students and currently has a cluster in astronomy at UC Irvine but none in particle physics. Based on input from faculty teaching the astronomy cluster, it is envisioned that a particle physics and cosmology module will be highly subscribed."

The model will reveal if the clusters are shaped like baseballs, cigars, pancakes or something more complex. Once the cluster shapes are known, the cluster masses will be estimated with unprecedented accuracy. This will give cosmologists a powerful new tool to study why the universe evolves as it does. The team will release their modeling code to the public. Senior team members will train junior members. The team will also develop free on-line teaching materials and interact with high school students in low-income areas.<br/><br/>The team will analyze extensive observations of clusters of galaxies to form three-dimensional reconstructions of their dark matter and gaseous matter. Inferences in three dimensions stem from differences in how the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich signals vary within a cluster. The reconstructions will vastly improve the accuracy of cluster-mass estimates. This, in turn, will improve cluster-based cosmology. The team's specific goals are to measure for each cluster (1) the major-axis orientation to +/-15 degrees and the axial ratio to +/-0.15; (2) the ratio of non-thermal to thermal pressures, achieving +/-0.2 in the outskirts; and (3) the three-dimensional mass profile, achieving +/-0.1 in the concentration parameter. To quantify the robustness of the measurements, the team will also evaluate (1), (2) and (3) for mock observations of simulated clusters."

These fields may be connected to astrophysical phenomena such as superconducting cosmic strings and are associated with the early universe. Previous collaborative efforts examined instabilities, proton decay in large magnetic fields, and the screening of fields by chiral symmetry breaking. The investigators propose to extend their collaboration to a study of quark spectroscopy in the presence of intense magnetic fields and explore the cosmological consequences of large magnetic fields. They hypothesize that large magnetic fields may occur in the early universe. Their presence could explain how the early universe evolved.

1.966178,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations hold a remarkable wealth of information about the early Universe and they recently transformed cosmology into a precision science. While the basic notion and the ingredients of an expanding Universe are well established, fundamental questions on the Universe's origin still remain unanswered. Measuring the CMB polarization provides a powerful tool to address the most important of these questions. The polarization pattern in the CMB can be decomposed into two distinct components, E-mode and B-mode, and the latter (yet to be detected) can provide two remarkable insights. With the detected B-mode polarization, one can study the large-scale structure of the Universe and the parameters that affect this structure, such as absolute neutrino mass and Dark Energy evolution. The degree-scale B-mode polarization also should carry imprints from the Cosmic Gravitational-wave Background (CGB), giving us a glimpse of the Universe during its tiniest (10^-35) fraction of the very first second of life. This CGB signal is a direct measurement of the energy scale at which the inflationary Big Bang occurs. The proposal requests funds for development of an enhanced large-format focal plane polarimeter POLAR-1 with 4,608 polarization-sensitive superconducting bolometers operating at 150 GHz and integrated with a 1.5-m reflective radio telescope. The proposed combination of angular resolution and bolometer array size make it ideally suited to study both the lensing-induced and the CGB-generated B-polarization. POLAR-1 will detect lensing induced B-polarization with extremely high significance and search for CGB down to 2% of the initial perturbation in power. The project's broader impacts would be in its path-finding nature of building an instrument ~10x more sensitive to the CMB polarization. As cosmology captures the public imagination, it is a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating students' interest in science. The project will continue contributing significantly to the training of next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with technology and instrumentation development, astronomical field observations, and scientific analysis."

This project aims to establish the properties of the interaction between these dark constituents and the luminous matter within clusters of galaxies, with particular emphasis on the influence on mass distribution. The mass of these objects is a fundamental quantity to derive cosmological parameters, i.e., to quantify the importance and evolution of the Universe's dark and luminous components.<br/><br/>This project will provide current large astronomical collaborations and future astronomical survey teams with detailed mass theoretical models built at four levels of increasing spatial complexity. Easily observable global quantities (zero dimension) will be related to the total mass through scaling relations. The project will extend previous results to an observationally-oriented analysis. Beyond the search for dependence of results on gas physics and dark energy, this part of the project will provide a clear indication on best sample selection and observation strategies to be adopted in X-ray and optical observations. The second part of the project is based on the concentration-mass relation (one dimension). While discordant observational results and theoretical predictions have recently created an increasing tension, this analysis aims to test X-ray, weak lensing, and strong lensing techniques to address this tension. Theoretical models produced by different gas physics and various dark energy models will be compared. Finally, the last two parts of this project aim to advance our theoretical understanding and modeling of cluster cosmology. The cluster mass derived from either X-ray or gravitational lensing is strongly influenced by the existence of sub-structures and geometry of the system. The next part of the project will identify the gas physical process that best characterizes the morphology of real clusters, and two observational techniques will be applied and tested using our synthetic catalogue.

0.09,"General relativity and quantum mechanics are the two major theories that govern fundamental physics, of space-time and of elementary particles. However, it is not known how they could be combined to a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Fascinating phenomena such as the very first stages of the big bang or the cores of black holes therefore remain out of the reach of our current understanding. This project investigates a wide range of systems in which both general relativity and quantum mechanics are relevant. The main interest is given by methods that allow one to derive physical implications by approximations, and to use the results to guide the developments of quantum gravity. Applications to the big bang and black holes often lead to conclusions that capture the interest of the general public. Related methods can also be used in systems not involving general relativity, where they may help to solve technical questions or to communicate results in a new way, supporting for instance the teaching of quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to introduce and evaluate new methods for a systematic analysis of physical implications of one set of candidate theories of quantum gravity, based on canonical quantization. Throughout physics, a powerful tool to derive potentially observable phenomena is given by effective theories which provide quantum corrections to the classical equations. Such systems can more easily be evaluated, analytically or numerically, than equations for quantum states and thus are more direct sources for the discovery of new phenomena. While standard techniques to derive effective equations do not apply to canonical quantum gravity, a general scheme applicable to canonical quantum theories exists (introduced by the PI) and is used in this project to address the main problems of quantum gravity. It provides the basis for a long-term program evaluating physical phenomena in the broad context of quantum gravity. Such a systematic derivation will make it possible to put effects found previously in simplified models on a firm footing, uncover new phenomena and provide reliable predictions. Results will be used to compare the theory with other candidates of quantum gravity, with the potential of a fruitful transfer of ideas and techniques between the approaches."
0.793065,"The discovery of dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, high-energy particle physics and our understanding of gravity. A broad range of observations from galaxies and superclusters to distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation, tell us that nearly 90% of the matter in the universe is in some new form, different from ordinary particles. So far, going back to Zwicky's observations of the Coma cluster in the 1930's, this matter has revealed itself only through gravity, and is referred to as ""dark matter"" because it neither emits nor absorbs light. <br/> A leading hypothesis, which we propose to continue testing, is that the dark matter is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, a hypothetical elementary particle produced moments after the Big Bang in collisions of ordinary matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their local density in our region of the Milky Way makes them detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. Natural WIMP candidates come from Supersymmetry (SUSY), an extension to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Supersymmetric extensions of the SM solve a number of outstanding problems in particle physics, among them the so-called gauge hierarchy problem. These problems are completely distinct from riddles posed by astrophysics and cosmology. Perhaps not coincidently, SUSY particles have just the right properties to be the dark matter. The search for WIMP dark matter in the galactic halo and the large accelerator-based experiments at Fermilab's Tevatron and those under construction at CERN's Large Hadron Collider are, in a complementary fashion, searching for the same fundamental physics. <br/> Our group, as part of the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) collaboration, is conducting the CDMSII dark matter experiment which is currently running a 5-kg detector array in the Soudan Mine. The latest CDMSII result (July 2005) set the most stringent bound to date - by a factor of ten over all other experiments in the world - on the presence of WIMPs in the galactic halo, and has begun to constrain some of the parameter space where SUSY particles could lie. With support from this award, we will acquire a year of data with this full array, the analysis of which will allow an additional order of magnitude in sensitivity. <br/> Our group has plyaed a significant role in building the experiment using our detector test facility at Case, as well as building and operating the main apparatus at Soudan. In addition, have conducted background studies and data analyses that have been central to extracting the science. To date, four Case graduate students have completed their Ph.D.'s on the experiment, and currently two third year students on actively contributing to detector operations, Monte Carlo simulations and analysis. In the coming two years, these students, together with the PI's and research associates (postdocs), will continue travelling to the experimental site to tune up the new detector array, operate, and bring home the data to analyze. When at the mine, we will all participate in the active outreach program consisting of daily public tours of the laboratory. <br/> While the Soudan science effort will consume about 80% of the resources supported by this grant, we intend to use the remaining resources to carry out detector R&D aimed at a proposed next-generation experiment called SuperCDMS. This will primarily involve cryogenic testing of new detectors being fabricated by our DoE-supported collaborators at Stanford that aim to have improved rejection of backgrounds and higher mass per detector module. Within this testing program, we plan to take advantage of opportunities in which streamlined detector packaging and simpler cold electronics can be simultaneously tested. <br/> We will also continue thin film tungsten studies that were initiated last year through undergraduate senior projects. This work aims to better understand the properties of the temperature-sensitive films that detect particle interactions in our detectors. At present, there is a variability problem that can be corrected but requires significant testing resources. The preparation of the films is carried out at minimal cost in a shared departmental facility and tested in our dilution refrigerator simultaneously with detector-testing runs. <br/> The final aspect of our R&D work is to begin development of a new assay technique to detect low-energy beta emitters, which represent a background tha can hamper progress on the experiment. Using a modest level of resources and undergraduate involvement, we can help lay the groundwork for rapid progress in the future. The efforts of our group will be highly leveraged by the presence of Prof. T. Shutt's group at Case and Prof. S. Golwala's group at Caltech. Shutt's group is developing low-activity MWPC elements for the XENON experiment similar to what's needed for the beta screener, and Golwala's group may be in a position to provide hardware for prototype construction."

If WIMPs make up these halos they can be detected via scattering from atomic nuclei in an underground detector.<br/><br/>Nuclear recoils from fast neutrons in underground laboratories are one of the most challenging backgrounds to WIMP detection. The rate of this background is at present poorly quantified. In this proposal, funds are requested for a portable experiment that will pin down their rate to about 10% by operating it in the Soudan Mine for a period of at least one year at a depth of 2000 meters of water equivalent. The long-used technique of gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator will be employed to implement a neutron multiplicity meter adjacent to a lead radiator,"" similar to the shielding in an actual dark matter experiment. <br/><br/>All dark matter experiments, as well as many other underground experiments, rely on knowledge of the neutron background environment. Being able to predict this background with greater reliability will serve well this community, and provide improved extrapolations for experiments aiming to operate in deeper sites in the future."
0.4,"This career proposal describes ground breaking techniques to detect a possible form of dark matter known as WIMPS: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. Most of the universe is thought to be made of matter which has never been observed through existing techniques and WIMPS is one of the logical candidates for such unobserved dark matter. The educational component of this proposal involves the development of interactive exhibits to inform the general public about such astrophysics research, especially using the Great Lakes Science Center."
0.171,"Properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter are at the heart of many fundamental questions in nature. They are currently being explored experimentally by using a wide variety of advanced new facilities around the world. Most critical to understanding experimental observations of various novel phenomena using these facilities is the symmetry energy, which encodes the energy related to neutron-proton asymmetry in nuclear matter. The latter is a fundamental quantity currently under intense investigation in both nuclear physics and astrophysics. The density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy is a vital ingredient in describing the structure of neutron stars and neutron-rich nuclei and the dynamics of heavy-ion reactions. It also influences significantly the strain amplitude, frequency and damping time of gravitational waves from both rotating and oscillating neutron stars. Moreover, the high-density behavior of the symmetry energy is also closely connected to the possible non-Newtonian gravity at short distance due to either the geometrical effects of extra space-time dimensions or the exchange of new bosons predicted by super-symmetric extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. However, our current knowledge about the nuclear symmetry energy especially at super-saturation densities is very poor. The ultimate goal of my work supported by this NSF grant is to determine the symmetry energy of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter using nuclear reactions especially those induced by high energy rare isotope beams and to examine its impacts on astrophysics and cosmology. To realize this goal, effects of the tensor force, isospin dependence of the short-range nucleon-nucleon correlation function and spin-isospin dependence of the three-body force on the high-density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy and their manifestations in nuclear reactions and neutron stars will be investigated. <br/><br/>The proposed activities will have significant impacts on advancing our knowledge not only in nuclear physics but also in astrophysics and cosmology. Moreover, the PI will promote more close integration of research, teaching, training, and learning by involving proactively both graduate and undergraduate students in carrying out the proposed research. This project will help better prepare students to become next generation scientists and engineers. Furthermore, the project will further enhance the infrastructure and conditions for both research and education at Texas A&M University-Commerce."
1.40077,"A broad range of astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates that 80% of the matter in the universe is in a new form which does not emit or absorb light, and has not yet been encountered in the laboratory. Many physics models suggest that the dark matter may be composed of one or more previously unobserved Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs. The astrophysical detection of such a particle through its interactions in a terrestrial particle detector would have a profound impact on cosmology and fundamental interactions, while also giving rise to a new type of observational astrophysics. This work supports key research and development and design efforts toward construction of a 7-ton liquid Xenon dark matter detector, known as 'LZ', to be installed at the 4850 level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. This detector will use established liquid Xenon Time Projection Chamber technology with read out of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-d position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid Xenon, removal of surface artifacts and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The experiment will take advantage of existing infrastructure and detector components from the LUX experiment, which is currently being deployed into the mine, allowing a rapid turn-around at the conclusion of that experiment's life. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>By exploiting the natural curiosity of the public in dark matter as well as the connection and familiarity with gravity, this project will provide a rich environment in which to develop a range of activities from tours and displays to partnerships with local schools and individuals, aimed at fostering an interest in science and science careers. Through both LUX and LZ programs, the collaboration will continue to play a key role in the efforts at Sanford in education and public outreach programs. Dark matter science also demands the development of new technologies that are ultra-sensitive to radiation and new methods for achieving ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. There is direct overlap with the methods used in a wide range of nuclear security and medical imaging contexts. The instrument that will be developed will also provide direct educational and training benefits at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, and will promote basic science research by providing access to non-Ph.D. granting institutions, particularly those in geographical proximity to Lead, SD."
0.0,"The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project under the Hungary Joint Fund between Dr. Sandor Szalay, Eotvos University, and Dr. David C. Koo, Lick Observatory, is to make major advances in the understanding of the structure of the universe. Current observations of the large scale structure of the universe show inhomogeneities on much larger scales than previously thought. Deep redshift surveys of galaxies with 'pencilbeam' geometry towards the North and South Galactic Poles indicate strong clustering along the line of sight, on scales exceeding 100 Mpc, with a provocative regularity. The existence and the distribution of such superclusters have profound implications for cosmology, but these observations will only gain a general acceptance after overwhelming evidence has been presented. These researchers will carry out new observations to: extract more information from the existing unique data, establish the statistical errors in more detail, study the effect of the projections, the transverse extent of the structures, and search for signs of gravitational infall. This project in cosmology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence."
0.25,"The principal investigator will study inverse problems arising in seismic imaging, cosmology, and medical imaging. The first of these is the mathematical problem of recovering the structure of the Earth from seismic measurements. The project takes into account that the Earth is best modeled as an elastic medium; that it consist of several cores, and that it is anisotropic (i.e., that the speed of seismic signals can depend on the direction). A second problem is motivated by applications to cosmology: to determine the stage of the early Universe, to the extent possible, from the cosmic microwave background radiation measurements. Finally, the principal investigator will study the mathematics of new medical imaging methods that use two different waves to form an image: one wave (electromagnetic, for example) is sent to the human body to excite the cells, which creates another type of wave (acoustic, for example) that one measures away from the body. In all the aforementioned examples, one is especially interested in solving local problems using local information: when measurements are done locally (say, on some part of the boundary of the relevant domain), one's desire is to recover the object locally, as well. Indeed, in many practical applications such measurements can only be done locally, and very often one is interested in the object under scrutiny only in a region near the point where the measurement is taken. The goal is to understand how much information is included in the measured data, to determine how sensitive such information is to noise and measurement errors, and to devise a means of using this data to reconstruct the object. <br/><br/>More specifically, the project will pursue the following avenues of research: (1) recovery of a Riemannian metric, up to isometry, on a compact manifold with boundary near a strictly convex boundary point from localized lens/distance boundary data; (2) recovery of a Lorentzian metric up to a gauge transformation from boundary measurements; (3) recovery of both types of metrics from wave equation data on the boundary; (4) solving the inverse problem for the elastic geophysics model with piecewise smooth Lame parameters; (5) inversion of the geodesic and the light ray transforms; and (6) solving inverse source problems that arise in medical imaging. Theses include both linear and nonlinear problems, from well-posed to mildly ill-posed to ill-posed. The aim is to recover the leading term in the underlying hyperbolic equation, which determines the geometry. Unlike much previous work in the area, this project allows for the existence of conjugate points, albeit modulo some additional geometric assumptions. The problem of local recovery a Riemannian metric in boundary/lens rigidity, up to isometry, is very challenging because simple linearization does not work, and there is inherent nonuniqueness. The principal investigator expects to combine ideas from tensor tomography, Melrose's scattering calculus, and other new ideas to deal with the nonlinearity. His methods would prove global uniqueness and stability as well, under the condition that the manifold admits a strictly convex foliation. Existence of conjugate points is not excluded. The inverse problems in time-space, including the integral geometry ones, lack ellipticity because only space-like singularities are recoverable. This makes the problem ill-posed. The light ray transform is a restricted ray transform, requiring specialized microlocal tools, not even fully developed yet for nonflat metrics. Those problems are of interest in geometry (where they are called rigidity problems), in the part of the theory of partial differential equations known as inverse kinematic and inverse boundary-value problems, and in applications like geophysics."
2.2382,"At the high energy frontier in particle physics there are several key, unanswered questions. As yet undiscovered, more massive particles could explain a number of these mysteries. For example, in the universe today, there is much more ordinary matter than antimatter. However, no mechanism of known particle interactions can explain how the universe evolved from the matter-antimatter balance at the time of the Big Bang to the present, highly unbalanced, situation. By making precision measurements, it is possible to detect the echoes of such massive particles, common at the time of the Big Bang, in quantities like the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which just reflects the separation of the neutron's composite positive and negative charges. In addition to advancing our knowledge in particle physics and cosmology, and generating technological progress, this experiment will involve post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students as an essential part, affording the young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their education and training in a forefront area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) is an explicitly time-reversal-violating observable that has played an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics; measured upper limits continue to limit extensions of prevailing models. For example, at present, supersymmetry (SUSY) predicts a value of roughly 10^-25 e-cm for a SUSY mass scale of 1 Teraelectronvolt and maximal mixing. It is clear that measurements at the scale of 10^-28 e-cm as proposed here will provide important input at combinations of very high mass scales and small mixing angles. The neutron EDM is also important for understanding the general pattern of T-(CP-) violation and the cause of the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe.<br/><br/>This experiment, to be performed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline of the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, is based on a technique that is qualitatively different from the strategies adopted in previous measurements. The basic technique in the present experiment involves formation of a three-component fluid of polarized neutrons and Helium-3 atoms dissolved in a bath of superfluid Helium-4 at a temperature T ~ 0.5 K. The ultracold neutrons in this volume, trapped in a plastic measurement cell, are produced by the collision of 8.9 Ångstrom neutrons with the phonons of the superfluid. The neutron and Helium-3 magnetic dipoles precess in the plane perpendicular to an applied external magnetic field, B0 in a traditional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance arrangement. The nEDM, dn, is determined by measuring the neutron precession frequency in the presence of a strong electric field, E0. Application of the electric field parallel (antiparallel) to B0 changes the Larmor precession frequency, nu, in proportion to dn. With B0 = 30 milliGauss and E0 = 50 kiloVolt/cm, nu = 88 Hertz and the frequency shift is 4.8 nanoHertz for an EDM of 10^-28 e-cm. Operationally, the neutron precession frequency is measured relative to that of the Helium-3 by taking advantage of the strongly spin dependent nuclear capture reaction and detecting the recoiling proton and triton via scintillation produced in the liquid Helium-4. The polarized Helium-3 atoms (in the same volume as the neutrons) also comprise a co-magnetometer (since any EDM of the Helium-3 atoms is suppressed by its atomic electrons); their precession is observed directly using SQUIDS.<br/><br/>This project provides important training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs as they participate in forefront physics research that stretches across areas including low temperature, atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The results of the experiment potentially impact particle physics as well as astrophysics and cosmology. Some technological developments are expected as several SBIR and STTR grants related to the experimental apparatus have been awarded to date."

It has proved invaluable for investigating the mass of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies, and the large-scale structure power spectrum, and it is the centerpiece of projects to measure the dark energy and its equation of state. However, the ability of gravitational lensing surveys correctly to measure large scale structure has not been verified by comparison with other large-scale structure mapping methods. This project will perform this comparison on the fields of the Deep Lens Survey, where the necessary wealth of ancillary information will be available. The work includes investigating promising techniques for improving the quality and resolution of mass reconstructions, and an effort to measure the properties of individual galaxy halos through a combination of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing and weak lensing studies.<br/><br/>An integral part of this research is to continue and expand upon a program that brings high-school students from the less-advantaged of the Providence public schools to participate in research, and experience first-hand the excitement of scientific discovery.

The new DEEP3 survey concentrates on the extended Groth strip, an area on the sky that has been observed with many of NASA's great observatories.

The number density, luminosity function, richness distribution, and structural properties of clusters are excellent discriminators among cosmological models, particularly so at high redshifts where many of the standard models predict rapid evolution of galaxy clusters. The sample of hundreds of clusters that will be compiled will also provide the best available measure of the high-redshift cluster correlation function and possibly outline distant analogs of the local ""Great Wall"" of galaxies. The information gained from analyzing the magnitudes and colors of thousands, and spectra of hundreds, of distant cluster galaxies will constrain models of galaxy evolution at a redshift where there are currently very few constraints. The information will also help to place limits on the formation epoch of cluster galaxies. The identification of a large sample of high-z brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and the data from observations of these clusters, will allow us to study BCG evolution and the connection between BCGs and the cluster environment.

The consistent treatment of hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, provides the desired link between the explosion physics and the observable quantities. Tools already created by these researchers will be further developed, and applied to calculate detailed flux and polarization spectra and aspherical light curves, whose results will be compared with extensive observations.<br/><br/>The impact of the proposed work goes far beyond a better understanding of supernovae, including the continued development of a widely applicable hydrodynamic radiation transport code, training of students and junior researchers, and the impact on the use of supernovae as one of the main instruments of modern astronomy and cosmology."
0.02,"Physical progress always proceeds on three fronts: observational/experimental, phenomenological--a coherent codifying of the data-- and finally, theoretical--finding a deeper understanding, through general laws, of those descriptions. The present rapid progress of both micro-, as witness the headline ""LHC"" results, and cosmo-scales, such as the newest ""Planck"" maps, puts welcome pressure on theory. Our work is on the ""deep"" theory side, attempting to find hints of possible generalizations of the ""standard model"", Einstein Gravity, that account for the deviations from its otherwise spectacular successes. Here we especially mean the apparent need for dark matter, which we hope to reduce to geometrical effects rather than by adding on Ptolemaic particles, without giving up the beauty of geometry. Thus, part of our efforts will be to continue our very recent results that exclude the currently popular ""massive Gravity"", because the latter loses all the beauty of geometry, instead unleashing too many variants and losing the tightness of geometrical description. Indeed, just as the Yang-Mills field theory counterparts of General Relativity were shown to exclude massive extensions, but relied instead on the now LHC-observed Higgs field, it looks as if the beautiful ""isolated"" nature of our basic interacting ""glue"" theories, Yang -Mills and Maxwell, will extend to gravity as well. On the constructive side, we intend to look for--less fundamental ""effective"", non-local but still geometrical, laws that replace the fuzziness of dark matter by additional terms that exploit the freedom remaining in the ""Einstein"" picture. <br/><br/>In more accessible terms, let us place our efforts within the present framework of front-line Physics, one that has received much recent media attention both in the Laboratory--especially the discovery of the ""Higgs"" field at the LHC accelerator, and at the opposite end of our universe-- by for example the newest spectacular pictures presented by the Planck, and other Cosmic observatories, of our entire Universe as it looked a mere third of a million years into its expansion the its present 13 billion. Our aim is to understand such general features of our world by--as conservative as possible--extensions of Einstein's General Relativity to account for Dark Matter and other unexpected new large-scale features. The conservative part of our program is to exclude candidates that go too far, by violating the (by now familiar) picture of curved space that General Relativity presents. So our twofold approach keeps a tight rein on that good, ""geometrical"", part of our hard-won picture of the Universe, while extending its reach within this realm, in particular by exploring different ways in which matter and geometry can interact there. We may be sure that the observational surprises will stay ahead of our inventive abilities, but that's the bootstrap that always works, and illuminates our world!"
0.062096,"This award will fund a combined observational and theoretical study of luminous blue variables, which are massive stars experiencing strong mass loss and evolving to be red supergiants. They are widely believed to the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, but many of these may not explode if the mass lost during their lifetimes is high enough. This team will conduct long-term observations of these variables in several nearby galaxies, in order to get an improved census of these objects, elucidate the mechanisms that may be responsible for giant eruptions, and to better understand the mechanism of mass loss and how stars evolve as they experience episodic (rather than steady) mass loss.<br/><br/>Modern supernova surveys are finding a number objects in nearby galaxies which are not true supernovae, the ""supernova impostors,"" which may be objects like eta Carinae that shed 10-20 times the mass of our Sun in a few years. The final stages of these most massive stars are important for a valid picture of stellar astrophysics and they are increasingly significant in cosmology. They are the likely progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursters used as cosmological probes, and many of the first stars in the universe are thought to have been very massive."
2.030147,"The development of a unique sensitive broadband dual-frequency millimeter-wavelength polarimeter is proposed by C. Bennett (Johns Hopkins University) for the primary purpose of detecting gravitational waves from the first moments of the universe. The polarimeter will be used to answer fundamental questions such as, ""How did the universe begin?"" In cosmology, Inflation is the cornerstone of the standard model, and the polarimeter data will provide a greatly improved limit or discovery of the energy level of Inflation. In physics, detection of a specific polarization pattern would be a detection of gravitational waves. These tests will be made using signals from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), over the full range of angular scales on which the primordial gravitational radiation leaves its strongest imprint.<br/><br/>The proposed polarimeter uses dichroic detectors to operate simultaneously at 130-165 GHz and 200-234 GHz. These bands both provide extra sensitivity for the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) array to the polarized CMB and serve as a sensitive probe to identify and isolate polarized Galactic dust emission. When combined with the lower frequency CLASS instruments, the scientific impact of the original hardware investment is greatly amplified. The capability of CLASS is accentuated by its sensitivity to angular scales >10 degrees. From its Atacama site in northern Chile, not far from the equator, CLASS will survey 70% of the sky, overlapping the sky areas surveyed by the other northern and southern hemisphere observatories, and enabling the kind of multi-band data from multiple observatories that has proved so useful in the past. As all CLASS data will be made public, they will be of legacy value to the entire community.<br/><br/>Funding for the development of the dual-frequency polarimeter for the study of inflation and gravitational waves in the early universe is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its participation in the Major Research Instrumentation program."
0.50202,"This award will continue support for a research program primarily focused on the observation and theory of supernovae of both types: core collapse supernovae in which very massive stars end their lives in spectacular explosions following exhaustion of fuel in their cores, and Type Ia supernovae which likely arise when white dwarfs in close binaries accumulate too much mass from their neighbors and collapse.<br/><br/>With regard to core collapse supernovae, asymmetries will be explored using spectropolarimetry, relating that data to information derived from systems for which the specific progenitor stars have been identified. Systematic differences in the polarization properties of hypernovae will also be investigated, especially in elements such as O and Ca. The study of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and their connection will be continued with the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) telescope array and the ROTSE IIIb telescope at McDonald Observatory. The Texas Supernovae Search will also be continued with the ROTSE IIIb telescope and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald will be used for rapid and time sampled spectroscopic follow-up. Core collapse supernovae will be studied with the Spitzer Space Telescope and core collapse supernovae discovered by the SDSS Supernova survey will be investigated. The nature of rotating magnetic collapse supermovae will be examined with spherical and multi-dimensional models. <br/><br/>For Type Ia supernovae, optical, near-infrared, Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared spectroscopy, and optical spectropolarimetry observations will be obtained with the goal of better understanding the progenitor evolution, the explosion physics, and the capacity of Type Ia supernovae to facilitate accurate cosmological measurements. A growing data set of spectropolarimetry will be analyzed in this regard as well as time series of data obtained with the Texas Supernova Search using the ROTSE IIIb/Hobby-Eberly Telescope combination. Through participation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Supernova Survey, the red shift ''desert'' from red shift of 0.1 to 0.4 will continue to be filled in with time on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope being a principal contribution to this data set.<br/><br/>The work carried out here is expected to have impact on many other areas of astronomy, notably stellar evolution, galactic evolution, and cosmology. National and international collaborations will be fostered through participation in the various consortia necessary for this work (SDSS, ROTSE, etc.). The results of this work will be integrated into various education and outreach efforts including a graduate course on supernovae, popular books, articles, and the StarDate radio program."
0.119999,"An important question facing fundamental physics is how the well-tested laws of Einstein's theory of gravity and quantum mechanics become consistent at the Planck scale -- the question of quantum gravity. This question is of central importance in understanding the origin of our universe, the big bang. Most of the remarkable progress on understanding the big bang has occurred in the context of quantum cosmology: quantum models of highly symmetric, and therefore highly simplified, universes. While these models have a structure guided by the full theory of quantum gravity, they are not directly derived from it as a quantum theory. The present award seeks to close this gap. This will solidify confidence in the predictions of quantum cosmology and also permit its insights to be used to guide future developments of quantum gravity itself. A second part of this research aims to further understand the relation between the relatively well-understood canonical formulation of quantum gravity and the Feynman sum-over-histories formulation, in which space and time are treated in a more unified way. <br/><br/>By allowing graduate students to participate in frontier physics, and to interact with other research groups, this award will have a broad and long-term impact on the development of future scientists.

Cosmology has become a data-rich field, especially with current and forthcoming CMB sky maps, which form a snapshot of the Universe at an age of a few hundred thousand years. Such maps have improved dramatically over the years and are now largely responsible for our detailed understanding of the contents and history of the Universe. CMB polarization maps may even be able to provide direct evidence for an inflationary epoch during the Universe's earliest moments. This research will develop methods for analyzing CMB polarization maps, especially the separation of components, and for characterizing common contaminants (such as Galactic dust) and their statistical properties. Theoretical work will also include how much extra cosmological information can be obtained from observations of the CMB quadrupole in remote galaxy clusters.<br/><br/>This work will be carried out in collaboration with talented undergraduates, many from under-represented groups, who will be introduced to the excitement of research in astrophysics."

The Texas Symposia are celebrating their 25th Anniversary since the first Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics was held in 1963 in Dallas. The Texas Symposia take place every other year and serve as international summary of recent developments in the main areas of astrophysics and relativity. The biannual meetings are held in different cities in the U.S., and every third meeting is held in a foreign country such as the meetings in Munich, Germany in 1978, land in Jerusalem, Israel in 1984. The first presentations on the discovery of quasars were made at the first Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics. The identification of pulsars as neutron stars, the first candidates for black holes, the indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves, millisecond pulsars, and other rather important discoveries were first presented at the Texas Symposia. In addition to this, X-ray astronomy, the interaction of particle physics and cosmology, big bang theories and the early universe, galaxy formation, active galactic nuclei, supernovae and compact objects, cosmic rays and recent problems of general relativity were extensively covered at the Texas Symposia.

0.0,"Under this award, Dr. Hogan will conduct three experiments in observational cosmology. The first will be a search for cosmic deuterium in the absorption spectra of distant quasars. The statistics of quasars are well enough understood to make it possible to infer from such data how nucleosynthesis occurred during the big bang. The second experiment will be a study with the Very Large Array of small scale irregularities in the background radiation. This will enable the investigators to put better experimental limits on theories of the formation of cosmic structure. Finally, a long standing search for Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies at very high redshift will be continued. Recent advances in technology will permit interesting new limits to be placed on processes occurring during the formation of the very first galaxies.

The volume and uniformity of the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample, which has a roughly constant co-moving number density, make it far superior to any other existing or planned survey for estimating the large-scale power spectrum. The research will focus on the baryon acoustic oscillations as a critical cosmological test, capable of quantifying the acceleration of the Universe with a precision similar to the supernova test but using a completely independent and very clean method. The SDSS LRG sample also provides an enormous data set for the study of the most massive galaxies in the universe today.

0.081282,"AST 0205785<br/>Thuan<br/><br/>Galaxy formation is one of the most fundamental problems in astrophysics. Most high-z objects<br/>observed thus far are found to be rich in heavy elements, thus not qualifying as bona fide primeval<br/>galaxies. An alternative approach is to search among nearby galaxies that may be actively forming<br/>stars for the first time at the present epoch. The best candidates for such a search are extremely metalpoor blue compact dwarfs (BCDs). They constitute excellent laboratories for pursuing the following cosmological problems. The standard hot big bang model of nucleosynthesis (SBBN) is one of the key quantitative tests of big bang cosmology. The primordial abundance Yp of 4He, together with that of Deuterium, is crucial for checking the consistency of SBBN. The relative insensitivity of 4He production to the baryonic matter density means that Yp needs to be determined to a precision of better than 1%. Dr. Trinh Thuan, at the University of Virginia, will evaluate systematic effects and correct Yp for them to attain that precision. He will search for more extremely metal-deficient BCDs in the newly released Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectral data base to improve the determination of Yp. The study of the BCD stellar populations will allow them to understand the properties of massive stellar populations in very low metallicity environments, like those prevailing in the era of galaxy formation. Moreover, Cold Dark Matter models predict that low-mass dwarf galaxies could still be forming at the present epoch because they originate from density fluctuations considerably smaller than those giving rise to the giant ones. Thus establishing the existence of young dwarf galaxies in the local universe will put strong constraints on the primordial density fluctuation spectrum. Dr. Thuan will apply age-dating techniques which he has developed and refined to a sample of very metal-deficient BCDs. There is a dichotomy in the way star formation proceeds in BCDs. In some, star formation occurs in a ""passive"" low-level diffuse fashion, with a low extinction. In others, ""active"" star formation occurs at a high level in Super Star Clusters, mixed with dense gas and a large amount of dust. Dr. Thuan will study the physical parameters which<br/>govern that dichotomy. Dr. Thuan will also study how the metallicity of the neutral gas compare with that of the ionized gas. Is the metallicity of the H ii region higher because of self-enrichment? Which constraints can be put on the time scale for the mixing of newly formed heavy elements in the H ii region with the HI gas? If the metallicity of the HI gas is very low, that would put constraints on the amount of metal pre-enrichment by the hypothetical Population III stars during the early pregalactic epoch. Such studies will shed new light on the study of abundances in high-redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems. Finally, Dr. Thuan will use these models to study correlations of the efficiency of mass exchange between the galaxy and its environment with global properties of BCDs such as their sizes, luminosities, metallicities, star formation rates, etc. <br/>***"
0.325,"The high-dispersion optical spectrographs that have thus far enabled the discovery of more than 400 extrasolar planets have a common susceptibility: the need for ultrastable, broadband, high-line-density, bright, and continuous wavelength calibration so that the small reflex velocities of the host stars can be precisely characterized over periods of weeks to years. One crucial technology for these investigations utilizes a mode-locked femtosecond pulsed laser - which produces a bright, regularly spaced set of emission features in frequency space - together with a Fabry-Perot filtering cavity to create the appropriate line-density, all locked to an atomic clock for long-term stability. These so-called ""laser combs"" have the potential for enabling radial velocity measurements to a precision <10 cm/s; thus the determination of the mass of Earth-like exoplanets should eventually be possible.<br/><br/>Dr. Ronald Walsworth of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Dr. Franz Kaertner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are planning to construct such a laser comb for the orange-green spectrum, a region well-suited to the detection of solar-type stars and therefore of stars in which a planet with an orbital period of ~1 yr would exist in the ""life-zone"", where surface water would be in liquid form. The team of investigators has an excellent track record in this area, having developed laser combs for the optical red and blue spectral regions. The new comb will be tested at the 1.5-m Whipple Observatory telescope on Mt. Hopkins, Az, and, when proven reliable, applied to an ongoing project at the 1.5-m telescope at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory that is searching for exo-Earths orbiting stars in the very nearby alpha/beta-Centaurus star system. The activity will involve both women as both scientists and students, and the resulting time-controlled laser technology should have application well beyond astronomy.

0.620882,"Measurements of the linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offer a unique probe of the early universe. The currently most-successful model of modern cosmology includes an epoch of rapid expansion of space-time shortly after the Big Bang. Gravity waves, excited during this inflationary epoch, propagate through the universe and interact at much later times to impart a distinctive polarization pattern to the CMB. Detection of this gravity-wave signature would have profound consequences for both cosmology and high-energy physics. Not only would it establish inflation as a physical reality, a detection would test physics at energies above 10^15 GeV, more than 12 orders of magnitude beyond what is accessible in particle accelerators, yielding new insight into the nature of Grand Unification and quantum gravity.<br/><br/>The predicted polarization signal in the CMB is weak and its measurement complicated by much brighter emission from the Milky Way galaxy. To effectively separate these two components, measurements must be accurate and made over a wide range in frequency. One of the most promising techniques for efficiently measuring the polarization of the CMB is in constructing many-pixel, integrated polarimeter arrays in which the signal in each channel is ""chopped"" electrically between opposing polarization states on time scales (~100 Hz) much shorter than those associated with the observing conditions. To date, these integrated polarimeters have lacked one key item: low-capacitance, low-insertion loss switches that can operate at cryogenic temperatures for long periods of time.<br/><br/>The MEMS devices to be developed by PI's Barker and Kogut are Micro-Electro-Mechanical switches that appear to satisfy all of the necessary criteria for completing these ""polarimeters on a chip"". Central to this specialized effort is the combination of state-of-the-art development facilities at the University of Virginia Microfabrication Laboratories and the Detector Development Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Together these facilities enable fabrication and cryogenic testing of sophisticated electrical networks operating at frequencies up to 250 GHz.<br/><br/>Going beyond the development of a technique for obtaining fundamental information about the early history of our Universe, the work to be carried out under this award will involve graduate and undergraduate students in the science and engineering of mm-wave instrumentation and produce new technologies that will benefit emerging applications in the fields of remote sensing and wideband communications."
0.57,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>Great progress has been made in recent years in detecting massive planets orbiting other stars. These exciting discoveries are an important step toward understanding the evolution of other solar systems and whether or not they may harbor life. Tantalizing as these discoveries are, however, they are not conclusive. Astronomers have yet to find a planet in another solar system that could support life as we know it. To do so would require finding smaller solid (not gaseous) earth-like planets orbiting a star within the ""habitable zone"" where the distance of the planet from the star is such that the surface temperature of the planet can sustain liquid water. <br/><br/>There are at least four ways to detect a planet orbiting a star. By far the most successful means to date has been to very carefully monitor the velocity of the star. If the velocity tends to vary regularly about its average value, then it is possible that some celestial body is in orbit around it and we are measuring the reflex velocity of the star due to the changes in the position of the planet in its orbit. This is a very exacting measurement to make and it relies on extremely accurate velocity measurements made with a spectrograph. Large planets create the biggest velocity wiggle and are therefore easiest to detect. But detecting smaller earth like planets in the habitable zone requires much higher precision than is currently available. Dr. Franz Kaertner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is designing a very stable and accurate calibration mechanism to improve the radial velocity measurements. He is working with a number of scientific colleagues and several students to design and build the device over the next two years. This new scheme uses a very rapidly pulsed laser to imprint a regularly spaced calibration ""comb"" of lines of precisely known wavelengths through the spectrograph and onto the spectrum of the star. This new technique will improve the velocity determination from the current standard by about a factor of 100, enough to detect earth-like planets in the habitable zone."
0.170011,"This project centers on the development of multiscale representation systems in various nonclassical and/or anisotropic topological settings such as on Lie groups and Riemannian manifolds and in the framework of anisotropic dilations of the space. Furthermore, it will develop sophisticated new methods for approximation and numerical computation using these systems. The project lies at the interface between computational harmonic analysis, spectral decompositions, orthogonal polynomials, nonlinear approximation and numerical analysis. It is organized into two main directions of investigation with several specific goals. The first research objective of the project is to develop frames with elements of nearly exponential space localization in the general setting of strictly local regular Dirichlet spaces with doubling measure and local scale-invariant Poincare inequality which lead to a Markovian heat kernel with small time Gaussian bounds and Holder continuity. The key point of the proposed approach is to be able to deal with (a) different geometries, (b) compact and noncompact spaces, and (c) spaces with nontrivial weights, and at the same time to allow for the frame decomposition of Besov and other spaces with complete range of indices. This will facilitate the development of well localized frames in the context of Lie groups or homogeneous spaces with polynomial volume growth, Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below and other new settings. The development of frames on the simplex and on graphs is another aim of this project. The second core objective of this project is the development of adaptive representations in the framework of anisotropic dilations of the space. Anisotropic phenomena appear in various contexts in analysis, PDEs and in applications. For instance, functions are frequently very smooth on subdomains of Rd separated by smooth curves or manifolds. This project aims at resolving this kind of singularities of functions (and more general singular behaviors) by utilizing the framework of anisotropic multiscale dilations of d-dimensional space or its subdomain, which may change rapidly from point to point at any level and in depth. The main strands of this approach are (i) the development of algorithms for rapid construction of best or near best dilation matrices leading to optimal sparsity, (ii) the construction of highly localized anisotropic frames and their utilization to representation and approximation of functions.<br/><br/>Many scientific areas require efficient representation of the underlying functions in the natural topology of the targeted application. The capturing of physical phenomena occurring at various scales requires locally supported multiscale systems relative to the application domains. Moreover, these systems should be amenable to fast and accurate computation. Such systems (called needlets) have been recently developed by the investigator and his collaborators for the sphere and the ball. The needlets are the outcome of a complete rethinking of data representations in the context of classical orthogonal and spectral representations and break new conceptual and practical ground, going far beyond traditional multiscale ideas like wavelets. Spherical needlets have already had a significant impact in cosmology/astrophysics for the statistical study of the cosmic microwave background radiation data. This award will support the development of image and data processing techniques, which will lead to much novel representation systems in new mathematical settings, allowing the treatment of new data structures. It will also enhance our fundamental understanding of complicated processes through the development of innovative adaptive methods for efficient (sparse) representation and approximation of geometrical objects that have jumps or other sharp transitions along curves or surfaces. It has the potential to impact many areas ranging from image processing and edge detection to geopotential, oceanographic and atmospheric modeling, and to physics and cosmology."
0.384143,"The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. In fact, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, an accurate measurement of the beta-decay half-life would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. The laboratory observation and measurement of such a decay would be truly transformative of elementary particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>This award provides base support for a team working on two neutrino-less double-beta decay experiments: USC has a major task for CUORE (using Tellurium-130) at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). The PI is the U.S. Coordinator for the construction of CUORE-0, which will operate in the CUORICINO cryostat and yield physics beyond that of CUORICINO, the precursor experiment to CUORE. USC also leads a major Task in the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR R&D (using Germanium-76). The PI is responsible for the procurement of enriched 76-Germanium Oxide, its reduction to metal, zone refinement to detector quality metal, and reprocessing of scrap material. He was responsible for building the facility for the Germanium-processing and is in charge of its operation.<br/><br/>A broader impact would be an important contribution to cosmology.

0.143907,"Various practical applications require effective representation of functions on the sphere or on the ball. Examples include the gravitational field modeling, geomagnetism, helioseismology, astronomy, cosmology, and seismology. In most applications the functions on the sphere have been traditionally represented in terms of spherical harmonics. The nature of spherical harmonics as global functions, however, creates problems. The spherical harmonic representations rely on delicate cancellation/interference of spherical harmonics and are slowly convergent. The existing representations on the ball using orthogonal polynomials or other methods have the same drawbacks or are even worse. The primary objective of this project is to develop innovative multiscale data representations on the sphere and on the ball based on newly created wavelet type systems, called ""needlets"". The needlet system on the sphere consists of almost exponentially localized radial band-limited functions, which are automatically extendable to harmonic functions in the exterior of the sphere and thereby enabling needlet representations to provide a highly effective framework for representation and analysis of harmonic functions such as the gravitational potential. The needlet compatibility with spherical harmonics permits for fast conversions between needlet and spherical harmonic representations. This makes them easy to integrate into the existing models based on spherical harmonics. Furthermore, the superb localization of needlets at fine scales makes needlet-based models highly amenable to efficient local updates, which is a significant advantage over traditional models based on spherical harmonics. The needlet system on the ball has a similar structure and consists of almost exponentially localized algebraic polynomials. Theoretical results show that the new representations are superior to the existing mono- and multiscale methods used in these areas. An important element of the proposed research is the employment of nonlinear approximation methods for effective representation and approximation of functions from needlets. These are multilevel techniques which allow control of the uniform (or other) norm of the error of approximation. Another step forward will be the development of anisotropic elements on the sphere and ball (e.g. curvlets) for better extraction of curvlinear features of the data.<br/><br/>The targeted applications of this research are mainly in the domain of geodesy. Most geodetic applications rely on the ability to compute accurately the gravitational (disturbing) potential. This project will pursue the implementation of multiscale needlet representations for modeling of the gravitational potential. Other potential applications of the new representations are in geomagnetism, helioseismology, astronomy, cosmology, seismology, where spherical harmonic representations are widely used. An important goal of this project is to promote the broad utilization of the new representations in other diverse disciplines (from geophysics to high-speed videoendoscopy) and to stimulate interest in younger mathematicians to this area. This research project offers an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students at the University of South Carolina to participate in testing ideas for further development."

This team will complete and characterize two multi-band optical and infrared cluster surveys, the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), using the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), using the Blanco 4m telescope in Chile. The BCS will be used to measure the galaxy power spectrum with 3.5 million galaxies extending to redshifts greater than one. These new programs will be coordinated with current and forthcoming millimeter-wave surveys designed to find clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Future surveys intended to deliver constraints on the dark energy equation of state will invariably be limited by systematic rather than statistical uncertainties. The ISCS and BCS will clarify and quantify these systematic effects, while simultaneously obtaining new, near-term cosmological constraints. The work uses catalog and cluster simulations to estimate precisely the survey completeness and contamination, and the cluster mass estimate accuracy. It also focuses on fields with optical/infrared and mm-wave data, now or soon, and with some existing X-ray data. The multi-wavelength approach enables a cross-calibration of the leading cluster selection methods, the possibility of developing cleaner and more sensitive selection techniques, and direct tests of the selection models.<br/><br/>This project will significantly impact larger experiments under way and to come. Because the BCS will constitute the largest contiguous deep optical survey in the southern hemisphere, the resulting public data set will be of great value for numerous other applications, such as galaxy evolution studies.

0.49981,"AST-0606912<br/>Steidel<br/><br/>This project includes several related observational programs to study the inter-connection between star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and gas in the diffuse intergalactic medium, during perhaps the peak era for forming massive galaxies and their central black holes, redshifts 1.5 to 3.5 (corresponding to look-back times of from 70-90% of the age of the Universe). Particular attention will be paid to the locations, lifetimes, and duty-cycles of accreting super-massive black holes, and to radiative and hydrodynamical feedback into galaxies and the intergalactic medium. The goal is to understand how feedback works on both small and large scales, and to infer how it shaped the subsequent evolution of structure to make the Universe we see today. This work relies on methods developed and tested by these researchers during previous NSF-supported studies, and the focus is on projects for which the tools and resources available to this team are largely unique. Dense spectroscopic sampling of well-controlled survey volumes will enable the first-ever tomographic observations of the high redshift Universe. These data will provide a three dimensional map of the baryons and their physical state, distributed throughout cosmological volumes, and allow for fundamentally new constraints on the physics of galaxy formation.<br/><br/>The results will provide fundamental statistical information useful to researchers in many sub-fields throughout extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. Much of this work constitutes early testing of science cases that drive the design of next-generation ground-based optical/infra-red telescopes. Results and primary data will be made available as soon as possible to the astronomical community."
1.010538,"This award is for a project to build an ultra-stable frequency calibrator for high resolution optical spectrography using a comb laser. The purpose of developing such a system is to be able to extend the indirect detection of extra-solar planets to lower mass objects, i.e. those comparable to the Solar System's terrestrial planets rather than the gas-giants. The indirect spectroscopic techniques have proven to be successful at finding extra-solar planets and the technology to be developed in this award will permit the spectral line positional changes of the parent star, which infer the existence and mass of a planetary companion, to be measured to significantly higher accuracy than before, thereby extending the technique to lower mass planets. <br/><br/>The award will demonstrate that comb lasers can be used for this application and the technology and techniques will be distributed to the general community. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will undergo training in instrumentation. This is a very topical field and the existence of extra-solar planets, especially those resembling the Earth, will capture the public imagination."

The cosmological study will utilize the multiple images of distant quasars and galaxies formed by the gravitational lens effects of intervening galaxies and clusters of galaxies as probes of the size and matter content of the universe. The neutron star investigations will explore the possibility that gamma-ray bursters are caused by an instability or nuclear explosion deep below the surface of a neutron star. Protostars, cataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries occasionally exhibit evidence for collimated outflow which may be driven hydromagnetically. This possibility will be examined in detail, with particular emphasis on determining the observational signa- tures peculiar to these different environments."

0.33,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>Great progress has been made in recent years in detecting massive planets orbiting other stars. These exciting discoveries are an important step toward understanding the evolution of other solar systems and whether or not they may harbor life. Tantalizing as these discoveries are, however, they are not conclusive. Astronomers have yet to find a planet in another solar system that could support life as we know it. To do so would require finding smaller solid (not gaseous) earth-like planets orbiting a star within the ""habitable zone"" where the distance of the planet from the star is such that the surface temperature of the planet can sustain liquid water. <br/><br/>There are at least four ways to detect a planet orbiting a star. By far the most successful means to date has been to very carefully monitor the velocity of the star. If the velocity tends to vary regularly about its average value, then it is possible that some celestial body is in orbit around it and we are measuring the reflex velocity of the star due to the changes in the position of the planet in its orbit. This is a very exacting measurement to make and it relies on extremely accurate velocity measurements made with a spectrograph. Large planets create the biggest velocity wiggle and are therefore easiest to detect. But detecting smaller earth like planets in the habitable zone requires much higher precision than is currently available. Dr. Franz Kaertner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is designing a very stable and accurate calibration mechanism to improve the radial velocity measurements. He is working with a number of scientific colleagues and several students to design and build the device over the next two years. This new scheme uses a very rapidly pulsed laser to imprint a regularly spaced calibration ""comb"" of lines of precisely known wavelengths through the spectrograph and onto the spectrum of the star. This new technique will improve the velocity determination from the current standard by about a factor of 100, enough to detect earth-like planets in the habitable zone."

Since galaxies are themselves made of dark matter, gas, dust, stars, and black holes, they also provide a unique probe of these fundamental quantities. Computers are now sufficiently powerful to resolve the internal structure of individual galaxies in simulations that model their formation from the initial conditions of the Big Bang. This CAREER award will push forward those simulations into the next generation in terms of resolution, as well as the modeling of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the physics of supermassive black holes. The simulations will allow astronomers to make some of the first direct observational predictions for the properties of galaxies being measured by major new observatories, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The work will also enable the PI and his team to revisit classic questions in galaxy formation, the regulation of star formation and black hole growth, and cold dark matter cosmology.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this research project are to produce and analyze a suite of cosmological simulations that explicitly resolve the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) of for the first time. The unique combination of realistic feedback from stars and supermassive black holes, dramatically improved numerical algorithms, and state-of-the art resolution will enable the PI to dramatically improve the predictive power of galaxy formation models. In addition, the team will make public and support the new numerical methods developed as part of this work, which will help to resolve many numerical problems and barriers that have compromised the accuracy and interpretation of previous-generation simulations. This will allow the community to assess the relative importance of numerics and physics in galaxy formation in a way that has not been possible in the past.<br/><br/>The PI plans to leverage the visual excitement of simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies by partnering with the Shafran Planetarium and Mueller Observatory at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, as well as data visualization experts. Together they will build and distribute a new platform to allow scientists to integrate their galaxy simulations into planetarium astronomy shows and television programs.

The PI will use wide-field imaging to map out the large scale structure of the luminous material and combine this with quasar absorption line studies to map out and identify the associated intermediate redshift (z=1.3 to 2.5) gas. The star formation rates for these intermediate redshift objects, their chemical composition, and their association with the gas will then be analyzed using near IR spectroscopy. <br/><br/>These studies focus on the properties of galaxies and their large--scale spatial distribution during an interval of cosmic time when the universe was between 10% and 40% of its current age. This time interval is believed to be the epoch when when the galaxy formation activity that produced the galaxies of the present-day universe was at its peak and when most of the stars in the present day universe formed. In the last few years, facilities and techniques have become available, which allow us to gather extensive empirical data on galaxies at these early cosmic epochs. The studies proposed here will use the facilities of the Palomar and Keck observatories to: 1) ``map'' the large-scale structure traced by early galaxies over volumes of space comparable to the most ambitious galaxy surveys of the local universe 2) compare the galaxy distribution at early epochs to the properties of the diffuse intergalactic gas in the same volumes (observed using complementary techniques) 3) explore new techniques for finding and studying large samples of galaxies in the time interval that is currently least accessible to observation-- when the universe was ``middle aged'' and 4) measure the chemical content and masses of significant samples of these early galaxies. All of these studies are intended to make significant progress toward a physical understanding of the galaxy formation process, in the context of cosmological models in which galaxy formation and evolution is the observable manifestation of the changing distribution of matter in the universe as a function of time.

If cosmic strings are detected, they will provide a window onto fundamental physics and energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. Over the past three years, the Tufts cosmology group has developed a large, parallel computer simulation of cosmic string networks. This simulation can handle a much larger volume for a much longer time than any other.

Most investigators seek to observe the EoR by detecting neutral hydrogen gas of the intergalactic medium (IGM) through its signature in the redshifted 21-cm spectral line. While a variety of projects are currently underway to detect the EoR signal, thermal noise will dominant the signal and will require careful statistical analysis of the observational data to infer the statistical nature of the EoR signal. Unfortunately, one of the statistical techniques employed will be to characterize power spectrum of the EoR signal even though this signal is expected to be non-Gaussian.<br/><br/>The intent of this project is to systematically explore statistics that reach far beyond the power spectrum technique. The investigators will compute radiative transfer simulations of reionization for a wide variety of well-defined theoretical models. Expected thermal noise, foreground corruption, and instrumental distortions will next be added to the simulations to produce complete simulations of observational sky maps in 21 cm. The investigators will next measure a range of statistics on these simulated observational maps to characterize the most robust useful information obtainable from the EoR signal.<br/><br/>Educationally, an undergraduate will receive support and mentoring at one institution, and graduate students at two institutions will receive support and mentoring.

A key problem in any quantum theory of gravity is understanding these fluctuations and their physical effects. One will be the effects of quantum energy density fluctuation in the early universe, especially in the context of inflationary cosmology. Previous studies by the PI and his collaborators indicate that these effects may be larger than one would have naively guessed, and possibly large enough to cause observable effects today. A related topic is the study of the probability distribution for quantum energy density fluctuations. A better understanding of this distribution, especially the part which describes rare but large fluctuations, can have applications to several questions in quantum theory and cosmology. Other aspects of the project will include a search for secular effects from quantum gravity fluctuations, that is, effects which can accumulate over the history of the universe. If such effects exist and can be detected, it would lead to significant insights. The project will also involve a search for laboratory experiments to detect such effects as negative energy and lightcone fluctuations in analog systems.<br/><br/>This project is expected to have a broader impact through possible benefits to other fields of science, to education, and to technology.

Through a judicious unification of general relativity with quantum physics, over the last five years, our team has provided a detailed theoretical paradigm as to what ""really"" occurred near the big bang.

0.69,"For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics.

String theory has also led to powerful new insights in mathematics. In this project, the Texas high-energy theory group proposes to continue their quest for a deeper understanding of string theory, focusing, in particular, on its connection with cosmology. Making progress in this field requires a many-pronged approach, and the Texas high-energy theory group plans to probe issues ranging from the proper mathematical formulation of the theory to extracting its implications for low-energy physics.

These stability results will add credibility to the use of the Kerr metric in detailed astrophysical models. (ii) Rigorous justification of the Penrose process for the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole. (iii) Incorporation of Guth's theory of inflation into the principal investigator's cosmological model. <br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>Black holes have interested both physicists and mathematicians since Einstein proposed his theory of general relativity in 1915.

It investigates the stability of black holes under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Such understanding is of great importance for predicting the nature of gravitational radiation originating in outer space. The stability problem will be considered in a manner parallel to the observations made by astronomers, leading to a better theoretical understanding of numerical modeling of solutions of Einstein's equations. The project also aims to put the question of extracting energy from a rotating black hole on a firm theoretical basis. The extraction of energy from a rotating black hole was proposed in 1968, but until recently the question was far too difficult to be studied. Finally, the project studies some questions in astrophysics dealing with cosmology and supernova explosions; these explosions of enormously dense massive stars undergoing gravitational collapse are responsible for seeding the universe with heavy elements, including carbon and iron."

The goal of this project is to develop accurate, robust, and efficient adaptive finite element discretization methods, parallel iterative solution algorithms and computer codes for computing geometrical flows based on both level set and phase field formulations.

The methods and algorithms resulting from this research will have the following attractive features: high accuracy, strong stability, low cost, and high efficiency. In addition, the proposed methods are also capable of accurately and efficiently approximating the geometrical flows not only before but also beyond the onset of singularities.<br/><br/>As critical applications from fluid mechanics, cosmology, and materials science are directly tied to the solutions of geometrical flows, it is expected that successful completion of the proposed research has the potential to significantly impact these applied sciences not only by presenting new methods for solving underlying mathematical problems but also providing insights for the understanding of each of these <br/>applications.

Analytic and numerical models of the epoch of reionization will both explore parameter space and calibrate against detailed physics.<br/><br/>This work is vitally important to experiments to detect and measure redshifted 21 cm emission, motivating optimal design and observing strategies.

SN1a are also a key to the chemical evolution of our galaxy and an ideal laboratory for advanced radiation hydrodynamics, combustion theory and nuclear and atomic physics. To take full advantage of new data, detailed three dimensional (3-D) radiation and hydrodynamical models are required. Some 3-D effects seem to be unavoidable for a close binary system with mass overflow, due to the interaction with the accretion disk and the companion star, the rapid rotation of the white dwarf, the physics of the ignition process, and the properties of the nuclear burning front. The present systematic study will reveal directional luminosity asymmetries and how to correct for them. By deciphering the ejection structure, it will provide new information on the explosion physics, the progenitor star, the accretion disk, and the companion star. The consistent treatment of hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, provides the desired link between the explosion physics and the observable quantities. Tools already created by these researchers will be further developed, and applied to calculate detailed flux and polarization spectra and aspherical light curves, whose results will be compared with extensive observations.<br/><br/>The impact of the proposed work goes far beyond a better understanding of supernovae, including the continued development of a widely applicable hydrodynamic radiation transport code, training of students and junior researchers, and the impact on the use of supernovae as one of the main instruments of modern astronomy and cosmology."

This team will complete and characterize two multi-band optical and infrared cluster surveys, the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), using the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), using the Blanco 4m telescope in Chile. The BCS will be used to measure the galaxy power spectrum with 3.5 million galaxies extending to redshifts greater than one. These new programs will be coordinated with current and forthcoming millimeter-wave surveys designed to find clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Future surveys intended to deliver constraints on the dark energy equation of state will invariably be limited by systematic rather than statistical uncertainties. The ISCS and BCS will clarify and quantify these systematic effects, while simultaneously obtaining new, near-term cosmological constraints. The work uses catalog and cluster simulations to estimate precisely the survey completeness and contamination, and the cluster mass estimate accuracy. It also focuses on fields with optical/infrared and mm-wave data, now or soon, and with some existing X-ray data. The multi-wavelength approach enables a cross-calibration of the leading cluster selection methods, the possibility of developing cleaner and more sensitive selection techniques, and direct tests of the selection models.<br/><br/>This project will significantly impact larger experiments under way and to come. Because the BCS will constitute the largest contiguous deep optical survey in the southern hemisphere, the resulting public data set will be of great value for numerous other applications, such as galaxy evolution studies. This team has a record of working with K-12 teachers and students, and will expand that work in conjunction with the present research."
0.5,"The LHC is expected to reveal the origin of particle mass and of electroweak symmetry breaking and provide access to new physics signatures that give insight into the fundamental nature of the universe. The top quark is a key player in this search for new physics, and this important relationship will be addressed in the work supported by this award. The primary purpose of this CAREER award is to enhance, strengthen and broaden Professor Schwienhorst's research program at ATLAS and initiate new activities in dissemination of LHC results to the general public using the Abrams planetarium on the campus of Michigan State University. This award allows for the expansion of the existing ATLAS single top effort at MSU (the Standard model (SM) single top group) to create a new group specifically devoted to new physics which can be addressed with the single top final state (the New Phenomena (NP) single top group). The PI has outlined an analysis plan leading from general searches for new physics in early data to precision measurements and specific searches with large data samples that require advanced analysis techniques. The results of this research will be relevant not only to particle physics but also to cosmology and astrophysics and our general understanding of nature. This work involves both graduate and undergraduate students in important roles in data analysis and communication of physics results. It connects particle physics to astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology through the Abrams Planetarium. The students, together with information graphics experts at MSU and planetarium staff, will build short self-contained modules about particle physics, the LHC, and the ATLAS experiment, initially for the Abrams planetarium, and later to be available for distribution to other planetariums around the country. The modules will be updated and expanded regularly as LHC results start to appear and a concrete picture of new physics emerges. The planetarium show not only will introduce a large general audience to particle physics but also will provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to learn about particle physics as practiced at MSU. This is an innovative contribution which significantly extends the reach of traditional particle physics outreach projects."
0.34,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education on new states of matter that may arise in condensed matter. The research focuses broadly on two areas. <br/><br/>Novel quantum order states of matter. A quantum ordered state restores its broken symmetries via a proliferation of topological defects. In conventional quantum fluids and gases only the simplest topological defects are important. The PI will investigate different possibilities which might arise in multicomponent quantum fluids and gases with strong or long-range intercomponent interaction. In such systems there can be phase transitions associated with proliferation of complex bound states of topological defects which do not produce a complete restoration of symmetry. It can lead to formation of new types of the aggregate ""super"" states of matter with partially broken symmetries such as metallic and superconducting superfluids which may arise at ultrahigh pressures in hydrogen isotopes and hydrogen-rich alloys. The PI plans to develop a theory and to predict experimental manifestations and possible probes of these projected new states of matter. The PI will investigate the properties of paired superfluids and super-counter-fluids in mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates of cold atoms in optical lattices<br/><br/> Magnetic response of multicomponent superconductors beyond the Meissner effect. The Meissner effect is the quintessential property of a single-component superconductor. The PI will investigate whether in some multicomponent systems gauge field fluctuations render the effective description mappable to Faddeev-Skyrme-like effective models at certain length scales. The magnetic response of these systems might differ fundamentally from the Meissner effect. The PI will investigate whether this results in topological defects in which energy is a non-monotonic function of the defect size. Existence of such defects in multicomponent systems may result in entirely novel physics.<br/><br/>The PI will also investigate the properties of ""type-1.5"" superconductivity and the conditions under which it appears. This is a superconducting state with non-monotonic vortex interaction potential which can arise in multicomponent, for example two-band, superconductors. The magnetic response of this state is different from that of traditional type-I and type-II superconductors. <br/><br/>The educational activities are aimed at bridging classroom education with independent research training through an original implementation of the Problem Based Learning concept used in medical schools and other areas for teaching Natural Sciences. The educational and research part will be integrated also by creating a broad course which will cover in a unified way concepts from condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and cosmology. <br/><br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical research and education seeking to predict the existence of new states of matter that may occur in materials under a wide range of conditions. The research focuses on states of matter where a macroscopically large number of electrons or atoms can act in a lock-step fashion according to the laws of quantum mechanics. This leads to phenomena that are a reflection of the counterintuitive laws of the quantum world, the world of the smallest particles like electrons and atoms, but on the macroscopic human scale. Superconductivity, a state of electrons that can conduct electricity without dissipation, is an example which occurs in some materials at low temperature.<br/><br/>The PI will study new kinds of quantum fluids that may arise in the electrons in complex materials, the element hydrogen under very high pressures which lies at the frontiers of experiments, and atoms that are cooled close to the absolute zero of temperature and trapped by laser beams. <br/><br/>The educational activities are aimed at bridging classroom education with independent research training through an original implementation of the Problem Based Learning concept used in medical schools and other areas for teaching Natural Sciences.

1.120875,"This group will pursue a broad program of research in gravitation and astrophysics. Among the topics to be investigated are the following: 1) Aspects of quantum gravity associated with noneuclidean topology will be examined. The possible existence of stationary states with noneuclidean topology will be considered in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes and spacetimes with Kaluza-Klein symmetries. Complementary approaches to quantization will be considered. 2) In the area of quantum fields and gravitation, research includes an investigation of the effect of quantum electrodynamic anomalies on the energy density of fermions in the expanding universe. Also under study are quantum corrections to the metrics of general relativistic fluid spheres, the possible loss of information and correlations in black hole evaporation, and relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation in the early universe. 3) Exotic processes in the early universe, such as the formation of a network of cosmic strings, and the amplification of quantum fluctuations by rapid expansion, leave behind a stochastic background of gravitational waves. A detailed study will be pursued to determine the observable properties of these waves, their effects on the isotropy of the Cosmic Background Radiation, and their detectability by ground-and space-based gravitational wave antennae. 4) Research in general-relativistic astrophysics will include the construction of a code that computes the nonaxisymmetric instability points of perfect fluids. The nonlinear dynamical evolution of unstable stars will be examined in collaboration with workers developing a relativistic 3+1 code. Other work will involve the determination of an upper limit on rotation independent of the equation of state. These topics are of high interest in exploring the fundamentals of modern gravitation theory, and connecting it to possible astronomical observations."

Randono to work with Dr. Lee Smolin at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada.<br/><br/>In recent years, there have been significant developments in our understanding of classical and quantum gravity, which have evolved largely independently. Investigations at this interface are necessary in order to push both fields to the next level. The study of quantum gravity often reveals deep insights into the nature of classical gravity that lead to a richer understanding of the current framework of classical gravity as well as suggesting modifications to the established theory. In addition, history has shown that new revolutions in quantum gravity often emerge from new perspectives on and new formulations of classical gravity. The PI is conducting various research projects involving explorations of gravitational physics at the interface of classical and quantum gravity, with the ultimate goal enhancing our understanding of both theories to push them to the next stage. Among the projects being explored, the PI is investigating the nature of spin in classical and quantum gravity, and the emergence of Einstein gravity from a theory with a larger symmetry group. The first project entails a study of the nature of intrinsic spin to geometry. From the classical perspective, in addition to the well known spin-orbit coupling emerging from the gravitomagnetic analogy, there is strong evidence that spinors themselves give rise to a frame-dragging effect via their intrinsic spin, which could give rise to a gravitationally modulated coupling of intrinsic spin to intrinsic spin. The PI is determining the gauge independent properties of this interaction, and investigating the possible astrophysical effects from a potential spin induced pair binding of neutral particles such as astrophysical neutrinos and neutrons in a neutron star. <br/><br/>The second project described involves an exploration of the consequences of the emergence of gravity from a more fundamental gravitational theory with a larger symmetry group. There is strong evidence that our current understanding of gravity based on the Lorentz group could be the symmetry broken phase of a more fundamental theory based on the de Sitter group. This evidence comes from the observationally from the existence of a small positive cosmological constant, and theoretically from the possibility of combining the spin connection and the tetrad into a single de Sitter connection. The PI is investigating the nature of instanton solutions and their possible significance in early universe cosmology. From the quantum perspective, the PI is investigating whether a fundamental de Sitter symmetry could lead to insight into the nature of the Immirzi parameter, a constant which appears to be necessary in the construction of Loop Quantum Gravity, which plays a fundamental role in the theory?s description of black hole entropy. The PI is investigating if the appearance of the Immirzi parameter could the by-product of the breaking of de Sitter symmetry to Lorentz symmetry, analogous to the emergence of the QCD-theta parameter."

2.45437,"Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background radiation tell us that ~85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. CDMS is currently operating at Soudan, Minnesota with 10 kg of iZIP detectors, which have already demonstrated a background rejection factor sufficient for zero background operation with several hundred kilogram targets. In order to fully use this capability, it is necessary to build a new larger and cleaner experimental set up and locate it at a much deeper site than Soudan to eliminate the cosmogenic neutron background. The baseline design of this new experiment (SuperCDMS SNOLAB) calls for a 100 kg germanium experiment located at SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada adapting the iZIP technology to 100 mm diameter detectors of 1.4 kg mass each.<br/><br/>This award provides support for Research and Development towards this experiment. It focuses on critical R&D goals: the testing and characterization of the proposed detectors, contribution to the design and testing of the cold hardware and electronics (novel HEMT and SQUID for ionization and phonon readout), and the procurement and characterization of the germanium crystals. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The SuperCDMS experiment will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical development will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in cosmology, astronomy and industry. The project will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies. SuperCDMS scientists will continue their involvement in K-12, their collaboration with teachers and their support for promising high school students from underserved backgrounds."

1.35,"The University of Washington Eot-Wash Group will develop specialized instruments with unprecedented sensitivity for the ultra-weak forces suggested by some modern explanations for the apparent accelerated expansion of the Universe and by theoretical attempts to unify gravity with the other three fundamental forces. In particular, we will enhance the sensitivity to violations of the weak equivalence principle by a factor of about 10. This will test a key postulate of Einstein's laws of gravity, provide a laboratory test of the gravitational property of galactic dark matter, close a loophole in the ongoing Lunar-Laser-Ranging test of the strong equivalence principle, probe speculations about the source of the mysterious ""dark energy"" that apparently comprises two thirds of the total mass-energy of the Universe, set stringent constraints on Lorentz-symmetry-violation in gravity, and probe any idea that predicts ultra-feeble ""fifth"" forces. Additionally we will test Newton's inverse-square law down to length scales substantially smaller than the diameter of a human hair. This will probe for ""large"" extra dimensions, test a possible explanation for the observed smallness of the cosmological constant and rule out a large class of ""chameleon"" theories that were proposed to hide the many long-range interactions generated by string theories. These tests should be able to probe new gravitational-strength interactions with length scales down to 20 micrometers. We will search for new short-range spin-spin forces arising from exotic bosons using an electron-spin polarized pendulum/attractor instrument with 10-fold rotational symmetry.<br/><br/>Because open questions about gravity are central to the gravitational, elementary-particle and cosmology communities and fascinate the scientifically literate community as well, (could anti-matter fall differently from matter? could the extra dimensions predicted by string theories have detectable effects? could dark matter have unusual long-range fields? is gravity truly the weakest force or could there be a whole regime of ultra-weak forces?) the Eot-Wash Group's work continues to have an unusually broad impact.

0.462787,"White dwarfs stars are the remnants of stars like the sun that form after their nuclear furnace has gone out. There are billions of them in our galaxy and most are not doing anything interesting besides cooling off. However, some of them orbit in close binary (double-star) systems in which the stars eventually spiral together causing massive explosions, others pulverize comets and asteroids left over from their planetary systems, and still others have ""starquakes"" that let us conduct seismology of their interiors. This project will study interesting examples of white dwarfs to learn about the supernova explosions that astronomers use to measure distances, the composition and configuration of exoplanetary systems, and the physics of material that is 10 million times denser than lead and cannot be produced or studied in any terrestrial laboratory. This program will also facilitate student training in instrument development and provide a new observational capability for the astronomical community. <br/><br/>The PI and his team of graduate students will carry out 3 separate investigations using white dwarfs as tools to study (1) whether hot DQ white dwarfs result from mergers of two sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, (2) whether metal-rich white dwarfs with circumstellar dust are accreting planetary material, and (3) the properties of ZZ Ceti stars. The common thread is observations to be obtained using the SOAR telescope with the Goodman Spectrograph, which was built by the PI. With partial support from this award, the PI will build a red-channel for the spectrograph, which is of great interest to the observational community and which will further enable the three key observational programs."
0.506157,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to constrain star formation models with high dynamic range simulations. Current star formation simulations are based on unphysical initial conditions or artificial driving forces that mimic the energy injection from a large-scale turbulent cascade. In this project, Dr. Paolo Padoan (University of California - San Diego) will overcome this limitation by developing star formation simulations that resolve the collapse of individual protostellar cores, while including the large-scale physical processes that drive the turbulence and control the life cycle of star-forming clouds. The project will include the large-scale physics by embedding the star-formation simulations, reaching a resolution of 200 astronomical units in collapsing cores, in a 1 × 1 × 20 Kiloparsec region perpendicular to the Galactic disk. The interstellar medium in this region will be modeled using three-dimensional, compressible, ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, including density stratification in the Galactic gravitational field, gas self-gravity, radiative cooling, photoelectric and cosmic-ray heating, large-scale Galactic shear, star formation, and thermal and mechanical feedback from Type Ia, Ib+c, and Type II supernova explosions. The large samples of star-forming clouds generated by these simulations will be processed with radiative transfer codes to produce datasets of simulated dust-continuum and line emission observations. <br/><br/>Star formation is central to much of astrophysics and cosmology. Results from this project will be relevant to studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies and to the star formation history of the universe. They will be used to formulate sub-grid models for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, where stellar feedback is important. The radiative transfer calculations will result in large datasets of simulated observations of star-forming clouds that will be helpful in the interpretation of real observations. Because this project will generate some of the largest simulations of supersonic turbulence to date, it will also allow high resolution studies of the statistical properties of supernova-driven MHD turbulence. Dr. Padoan, in collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center, has recently started the Computational Astrophysics Data Analysis Center (CADAC), a new service to collect, share, and analyze datasets from numerical simulations. CADAC provides powerful data-storage and data-analysis resources to the astrophysical community, encouraging the early publication of numerical datasets and data-analysis tools. Through CADAC, data from this project and computational resources will be available to the scientific community, including graduate students."
0.825885,"Dr. Kannappan proposes to lead and carry out a project that will advance our understanding of cosmology by investigating the 'missing baryons' problem, so named since most of the normal baryonic matter predicted from early-universe cosmology is not seen at the present epoch. She will investigate this problem by conducting the RESOLVE (Resolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE) survey. RESOLVE will produce 2-D optical and radio spectroscopy of a carefully selected sample of approximately 1500 galaxies in the nearby cosmic web. When the survey is completed it will be the first to:<br/><br/>- Directly determine the fundamental distribution of internal velocities within the sample, i.e. the 'velocity function' of the sample<br/>- Perform an analysis of disk growth and survival in relation to merging and cosmic structure<br/>- Put a new type of constraint on the distribution of missing baryons through a self-consistent mass census which will be analyzed in conjunction with star formation patterns and numerical simulations<br/><br/>Dr. Kannappan will use the data from RESOLVE to train a new generation of scientists in multiple areas of astronomy including: spectroscopy, radio astronomy, and survey data handling. RESOLVE data will be made available on the web where it will be used in data-driven activities that are geared toward projects for high school and undergraduate students. Additionally, Dr. Kannappan will develop an astronomy curriculum that is aligned to the North Carolina science standards.

0.45,"This research will investigate quantum phase transitions using ultracold atomic gases cooled close to absolute zero temperature. Phase transitions play important roles in many areas of physics including cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter. The freezing of water to ice provides a familiar example: the motion of water molecules undergo a phase transition upon crystallization as the temperature falls below the freezing point. In cosmology, it is conjectured that the large scale structure of the universe is a vestige of defects (e.g. ""cosmic strings"") formed as the Universe cooled through a phase transition (via the so-called ""Higgs mechanism"") shortly after the Big Bang. This research will explore quantum phase transitions and associated phenomena in an unexplored regime at the opposite end of the temperature scale, close to absolute zero on the Kelvin temperature scale (or nearly 460 degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit temperature scale). The experiments will use ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (a quantum state of matter that forms at extremely low temperatures) to explore phase transitions in which the behavior of the transition is determined by quantum effects rather than thermal effects. In addition to providing new insight to the fundamental quantum science of many-particle systems, these experiments have potential applications to quantum information science and to the development of new quantum sensors for inertial guidance and measurement of gravity and magnetic fields. <br/><br/>This experimental research will study strongly interacting ensembles of spin-1 atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate to explore the nature of quantum phase transitions in the neighborhood of the critical point and to investigate creation, control and characterization of non-classical highly entangled states of the ensembles. The investigations use small rubidium-87 atomic Bose-Einstein condensates containing just a single spin domain, such that the dynamic evolution occurs only in the internal spin degrees of freedom. These condensates feature a well-characterized Hamiltonian with a tunable quantum phase transition that allow exploration of both ferromagnetic and polar (nematic) ground states of the spins. The combination of an exactly solvable Hamiltonian with a quantum phase transition together with demonstrated dynamics in the quantum regime provide a unique combination of tools to explore important topics including high precision studies of a second order quantum phase transitions, exploration of excitations across a quantum critical point, and the generation of massively entangled states. A common theme in all of these studies is the role of finite size effects that manifest in the quantum fluctuations of the system. This research will provide insight into fundamental principles of many-particle quantum mechanics that are important to many areas of physics and will point the way to future explorations of quantum many-body spin systems including thermalization and ergodicity crossing a quantum phase transition, investigations of Hamiltonian quantum chaos and other non-linear phenomena, and finite temperature effects."

0.057,"Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background radiation tell us that ~85% of the matter in the universe is made of unknown particles. Understanding the nature and properties of dark matter is fundamental for furthering the fields of cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics and for shaping our understanding of the makeup of the Universe. A leading theoretical candidate for this dark matter is a class of particles known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which would have been produced at the time of the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to detect these particles via their scattering from atomic nuclei have significantly matured and are possibly within a few years of making a definitive detection. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare WIMP interactions and distinguish them from backgrounds. <br/><br/>This award will provide support for the continuation of the University of Florida's efforts in terms of supporting the operation and data analysis of the SuperCDMS Soudan experiment, performing detailed R&D into detector response to electron recoil backgrounds, both empirically and via simulation, and supporting the detector characterization and testing program for devices intended to be deployed in the proposed SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment at SNOLAB. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The SuperCDMS experiment has had a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search.

0.226399,"AST-0071192<br/>PARTRIDGE<br/><br/>Where and how do large structures in the Universe first form and begin to emit starlight? Observations at radio wavelengths, since they are unaffected by obscuration by dust, can be used answer such questions. A series of deep centimeter-wavelength surveys of a region of the sky will be made. These observations will complement excellent optical, IR and X-ray data available. These surveys will enable us to determine the nature and abundance of faint, high-redshift, radio sources and to determine the mechanism responsible for their radio emission. The star formation history of the Universe may thus be calculated without the need to correct for dust extinction as in observing at optical wavelengths. This will enable the improvement of the predictions of the fluctuations, which Extragalactic radio sources will introduce, in current and planned searches for small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, radio observations of the cores of X-ray bright galactic nuclei will be used to estimate the masses of the supermassive black holes that reside there. Included in the planned research are several closely related research projects that are designed to have the right scope for undergraduate students. These projects include improving the counts of radio sources at 8.4 GHz; archival searching of deep radio surveys for variable sources; improving statistics on GHz peaked spectrum sources; and archival searching for high resolution radio (and X-ray) observational data on galactic nuclei.<br/><br/>An important part of the planned activities is to repeat a successful experiment funded by a previous NSF grant.

0.276,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education on two significant themes in contemporary materials research. The first is the study of topological phases which can be broadly defined as phases of matter characterized by emergent gauge fields. These are to be contrasted with broken symmetry systems which exhibit emergent local order parameters in the sense of Landau. The second is the study of real time dynamics in quantum systems in and out of equilibrium. A significant set of topics involve ingredients from both themes. <br/><br/>The research is organized in four clusters.<br/><br/>The first cluster involves non-equilibrium dynamics near thermal and quantum critical points: the so called Kibble-Zurek problem first introduced into statistical mechanics with a cosmological motivation. The PI will build on the recent systematization of the Kibble-Zurek scaling limit and range over a set of model studies of the universal content using more traditional techniques as well as the newly introduced ideas of gauge-gravity duality or holography, detailed modeling appropriate to experimentally promising contexts, conceptual questions such as the relationship between linear response and fluctuations out of equilibrium and the identification of slow dynamics in topologically ordered systems.<br/><br/>The second cluster involves the quantum Hall system which continues to be interesting as the primary source of topologically ordered states. The research involves the physics of the non-abelian Pfaffian state that is observed at filling factor 5/2, a new field theory for the quantum Hall effect which is identified with proximity to a nematic instability and the physics of localization in a magnetic field in a long range correlated potential.<br/><br/>The third cluster involves a relatively new system produced by the search for qubits: superconducting circuit arrays. These allow for the creation of many-body systems where the particles are dressed photons or polaritons but necessarily involve an out of equilibrium element due to photon losses. The PI will study their many body physics in a regime not addressed to date, one which could allow the creation of topological states of photons. This work will also engage with the non-equilibrium aspects in order to make sense of the experiments that are envisaged.<br/><br/>The fourth cluster involves magnetic systems. The PI will develop a hydrodynamics for topologically ordered spin liquids thus paralleling the development of hydrodynamics for broken symmetry systems. This is particularly interesting in the context of searches for sharp signatures of spin liquids in experimental systems that are believed to such states. It is also proposed to examine a new frustrated magnetic Hamiltonian on the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice which has been the source of much interesting physics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education on two frontier topics in theoretical materials research. The first is the study of new electronic states of matter in materials and the second is the study of quantum mechanical systems which are not in equilibrium.<br/><br/>A fundamental frontier activity in the physics of condensed matter is the identification and analysis of new phases of matter. Historically, most phases like these were understood to be examples of spontaneously broken symmetries, where the microscopic entities arrange themselves in particular static patterns that are less symmetric than the underlying forces between them. More recently, it has become clear that matter can exhibit a different family of phases where the symmetry remains unchanged but instead the constituents arrange themselves into fluctuating arrays of loops or more complex geometrical arrangements. Such phases also exhibit the phenomenon of fractionalization wherein their excitations manage to carry fractions of the quantum numbers, such as electrical charge, of the microscopic entities, such as electrons.<br/><br/>The study of such actual and potential phases is interesting for their intellectual challenge, to help make sense of an increasing set of laboratory realizations, and most recently, because a set of them have the potential to serve as a basis for the construction of a quantum computer which operates through the manipulation of quantum mechanical states. Such a computer can in principle be many times faster than the fastest supercomputers for certain algorithms. <br/><br/>This award supports fundamental theoretical research to advance the general theory of topological phases. Three experimental systems will be studied in detail; two of these are also of interest in the context of quantum computation. The second activity supported by this award is the study of quantum dynamics out of equilibrium. This is a difficult enterprise as the mathematical complexity is considerably greater than when systems are in equilibrium. Recent advances in the laboratory realization of cold atomic systems which can be readily prepared and studied out of equilibrium have present opportunities to advance understanding. The work supported by this award will focus on these and other experimental systems and is a direct descendant of some seminal work inspired by Cosmology by Kibble and Zurek and thus has intellectual connections to out of equilibrium behaviour of the universe itself!"

Organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin, the institute will involve approximately 29 participants from the United States and Latin America including graduate students and junior and established investigators, and about 12 instructors (internationally recognized scientists, active in the field). The activities will consist of a combination of tutorial lectures, advanced-topic presentations, round table discussions, and poster sessions, with the goal of providing the participants with an up-to-date review of this field of research. This choice of topic was made based both on its timeliness and its importance.

Where are most of the atoms in the universe? How do galaxies and their environments affect each other? These questions will be addressed by a detailed study of a 100 square-degree strip of the Southern sky. Our observations will focus on the universe when it was between 2 and 6 billion years old. <br/><br/>The new Southern African Large Telescope (SALT, in South Africa) will be used to make four-color images of the strip. The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, in Chile) will make microwave maps of this strip. We will identify galaxy clusters in the strip and then use the SALT spectrograph to obtain ages and redshifts for galaxies in the clusters. The Magellan and Blanco telescopes, also based in Chile, will provide additional high-quality imaging data for a gravitational lensing survey, directly probing the distribution of mass in the survey region. By combining our microwave maps with space-based X-ray observations, we will be able to measure the temperature and distribution of gas and compare it to the spatial distribution of galaxies. An integrated analysis and numerical simulation effort will combine all of the data sets and extract constraints on the universe as a whole and on the evolution of galaxies and clusters.<br/><br/>This ambitious program will build strong international collaborations based on the scientific talents of three major US astronomy and physics programs (Princeton, Rutgers, and the University of Pennsylvania) and of two Southern Hemisphere institutions, Catolica University (Chile) and the University of KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa). This novel multi-national effort will provide superb international scientific training for undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty. Undergraduate students will engage in an 8-week international research experience at one of the two Southern Hemisphere sites. Graduate students will be paired with their peers at other partner institutions and will participate in weekly video and web teleconferences. Semi-annual summer schools and workshops (alternating between hemispheres) will introduce graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to cutting-edge technologies, new scientific results, and different cultures. Students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty from other ACT institutions in the UK, Mexico, and Canada will also participate in the summer school, thus broadening the international collaborative network. Postdoctoral researchers and faculty will also travel to South Africa and Chile to work with their colleagues on data collection, analysis, and synthesis.

But precision measurements of dark energy with SNeIa in rest-frame optical light are currently limited by systematic uncertainties stemming from an incomplete understanding of SNIa colors, dust, and host environments, as well as the calibration of astronomical measurements. Recent work has demonstrated that SNeIa are superior distance indicators in the near-infrared (NIR), with more standard peak H-band magnitudes, and a relative insensitivity to dust. This presents us with the timely opportunity to exploit NIR SNIa observations and new methods in SNIa cosmology to free SNeIa from their systematic shackles and fully exploit their potential in current and future dark energy missions. <br/>NIR observations to date have been largely limited to z < 0.03 where distance measurements have suffered from significant peculiar velocity uncertainties. <br/>This project will support an approved 72-night three-year NOAO Survey on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope to observe 144 SNeIa in the NIR from 0.03 < z < 0.08.<br/><br/>This NOAO Survey program focuses on SNeIa in the Hubble flow to obtain reliable NIR luminosities free from peculiar-velocity confusion and the uncertainties of dust. This effort includes a particular focus on accurate calibration incorporating recently demonstrated techniques for characterization of telescope systems and the Earth?s atmosphere. The results of this work will (1) extend the NIR Hubble diagram past currently available samples, (2) quantitatively demonstrate the degree to which SNeIa are robust standard candles in the NIR, (3) provide key insights about the color evolution and intrinsic properties of SNeIa and their host galaxies, and (4) establish a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor for future NIR supernova surveys from JWST, Euclid, and WFIRST/NEW.<br/><br/>The research of this proposal will involve a strong undergraduate component to involve the next generation in active large astronomical research projects. This project will provide training and mentoring to a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher, who will in turn work with the undergraduates to enable them to make significant contributions to the success of the research and outreach missions of this proposal.<br/>The underlying theme of this proposal is using the variable sky to explore the cosmos. This theme will be shared with the public of all ages and backgrounds through public displays of the results. To communicate the new time-domain nature of astronomy this project will create portable sky projections and movies based on Pan-STARRS, SDSS, and WIYN supernova images in near real-time. These will involve both continuous unattended displays visible in public places as well as more targeted displays at specific public events with students and astronomers on-hand to directly engage with the public. An integration of cutting-edge astronomical surveys into the daily experience of citizens, particularly younger members, will spark a lifetime of interest across a diverse spectrum of the population.

0.063376,"This award supports several projects which involve studying quantum effects as they relate to both cosmology and black holes. The same techniques will be used to compute the force a particle feels due to the gravitational radiation that is emitted as it orbits a black hole. One of the most important ideas in cosmology today is that early in its history the universe underwent a process of extremely rapid expansion called inflation. Quantum effects were very important both during and shortly after this period of inflation. They are almost always computed using an approximation to quantum field theory called the semiclassical approximation. The validity of this approximation as it relates to the period of inflation and to particle production that occurs immediately after this period will be investigated. In addition, studies will be made of the effects that quantum fields have on the event horizons of black holes. The event horizon is the boundary in space between where light can get away from the black hole and where it cannot. A study will also be made of the difference between the effects quantum fields have on the geometry far from the event horizon of a black hole versus the effects they have on the geometry far from the surface of a static star. When a particle orbits a black hole gravitational radiation is emitted whose effect can change the subsequent orbit. If the particle is charged electromagnetic radiation is also emitted. These can be modeled by using a simpler type of radiation called scalar radiation. Projects will be worked on that involve the computation of the force this scalar radiation exerts on a particle as it orbits a black hole.<br/>Some of the most important predictions of inflation including the creation of density fluctuations that eventually evolve into galaxies depend on quantum effects which are computed using semiclassical approximations. It is thus extremely important to determine whether these approximations are valid both during and immediately after inflation. If calculations for reheating in some chaotic inflation scenarios are invalidated, then much more difficult calculations will be necessary. In the case of black holes there are indications that there are special cases where it is possible that quantum effects might have such a significant effect on the event horizon of the black hole that they prevent that type of black hole from existing. It is not clear how likely it is that this will happen but it is important to investigate whether or not it does happen. One of the important sources of gravitational waves for the proposed space based gravitational wave detector called LISA is a neutron star or black hole formed from the collapse of a star which orbits a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. The detailed nature of the waves emitted depend upon the trajectory of the orbiting body. This in turn depends on the force that the emitted gravitational radiation emits on the orbiting body. Thus it is very important to compute this force. It will be possible to involve both undergraduate and graduate students in many of these projects. There is a<br/>long history of undergraduate and graduate students working on these types of projects and gaining training in both numerical and analytical research techniques as well as being coauthors on publications."

The CMB is the fiery afterglow of the Big Bang. Measurements of the CMB form the bedrock foundation of the standard cosmological model. Our work builds on and extends previous work that characterized the temperature and polarization anisotropies (variations in the spatial distribution of the radiation) and laid the foundation for the WMAP satellite. We will measure the fine angular scale temperature anisotropy (l>1000) and polarization to understand the dark energy, dark matter, mass of the neutrino, and ionization history of the universe. Results from our experiments are anticipated to directly inform us of the inflationary epoch.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research include substantial educational development for students, continued public outreach, and the scientific impacts mentioned above. The Princeton group will continue its vigorous program of hands-on research for undergraduates and graduate students. As one example, we have supervised over 40 summer students over the past three years, including 14 women and minorities. Group members will continue to give frequent public talks and interviews, mentor the local Society of Physics Students, interact with local school groups, develop new classes, and maintain public web pages."
3.455,"The PIs propose a broad program of research in theoretical physics which aims to extend the recent advances in string theory, particle physics and cosmology, and to apply them to ongoing experimental programs. One of the most important tools for understanding Gauge Theories is the connection between Semiclassical Gravity in anti-deSitter Space (AdS) and the correlation functions of the conformal invariant gauge field theory that lives on the boundary of the Space (CFT), namely the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, they plan to continue to study the dualities between gauge and string theories. They intend to both deepen the insight into the origins of these dual relations and the reasons for their success as well as broaden the scope of their physical applications. The intend to study, in this framework, the confinement problem (why we don't find quarks in a detectro) and hadronic spectra, inflationary cosmology and cosmic strings. New areas will be in the areas of particle model building beyond the Standard Model which display Supersymmetry breaking, understanding the dynamics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma and other aspects of many-body physics. An important new component of the group?s research activity will be field theoretic particle model building and LHC (large Hadron collider) physics. The group plans to develop new tools for LHC data analysis that will be crucial in identifying new physics. This will be based on a mass-shell approach to analyzing the data which is free from theoretical bias. The group will be involved in collaborations and exchanges of ideas between particle phenomenologists, experimentalists and string theorists, which they hope will facilitate the discoveries at the LHC. The group will also will pursue other interesting applications of Quantum Field Theory including the physics of heavy-flavored baryons, and turbulence. <br/>The broader impacts of this project is to prepare post-docs, graduate students, as well as advanced undergraduates, to do successful research in theoretical physics. The group is involved in organizing and lecturing at summer schools, organizing and giving public lectures, and informing the general public about recent research advances. The group is in the process of expanding these outreach activities to include lecturing at minority High Schools and Junior colleges. The group runs the PITP summer school which has a special program of outreach to women and minority graduate students."

0.13332,"9404437 Sinai The proposed research will concern three different topics. The first is the study of ergodic like properties of standard-like maps. The main difficulty is due to the fact that in these cases, stable and unstable foliations are never transversal to each other. The new ideas and methods are taken from the theory of hyperbolic billiards. In the second topic, we shall study quasi-linear equations with random initial data and random coefficients. These equations appear in some cosmological problems. The analysis of statistical properties lead to new very interesting problems in probability theory. The third topic deals with some mathematical problems in the theory of quantum chaos. This is a new direction in mathematical physics which can be very promising. In general, we shall deal with several basic problems in the theory of chaos. The first one can be considered the most important open problem in Hamiltonian dynamics and concerns the appearance of chaotic behavior from pure deterministic laws of motion. The second one deals with equations of continuous media where the randomness is incorporated through initial data. It has important applications in cosmology. The last one concerns a new and difficult topic called quantum chaos and is of big interest for physics and mathematics. ***"
0.079903,"Technical Abstract<br/>The Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) project seeks to detect hyperfine emission from neutral Hydrogen (21 cm rest wavelength) in the intergalactic medium about 100 million years after the Big Bang (redshifts 16-40). A detection would deliver the first observational constraints on models of structure formation and on the formation of the first stars and black holes in the Universe. LEDA will develop and integrate signal processing instrumentation into the new first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). This comprises a large-N correlator serving all 512 dipole antennas of the LWA-1, leveraging a packetized CASPER architecture and combining FPGAs and GPUs for the F and X stages. Iterative calibration and imaging will rely on warped snapshot imaging and be drawn from a GPU-enabled library (CUWARP) that is designed specifically to support wide-field full polarization imaging with fixed dipole arrays. Calibration techniques will include correction for ionospheric refraction and direction dependent dipole gains, and exploration of pulsar data analysis to improve performance. Accurate calibration and imaging will be crucial requirements for LEDA, necessary to subtract the bright foreground sky and detect the faint neutral Hydrogen signal. From the computational standpoint, LEDA is a O(100) TeraFlop per second challenge that enables a scalable architecture looking toward development of radio arrays requiring power efficient 10 PetaFlop per second performance. Stage two of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA2) is one example.<br/><br/>Lay Abstract<br/>When did the first stars form? These stars are expected to be much more massive than the stars that are around us today. Did supermassive black holes form at the same time, earlier, or later? One of the great challenges of cosmology today is the study of these first generation objects. Their formation is widely hypothesized to have begun about 100 million years after the Big Bang, but no data are available to test this theory. The only available means to study the Universe at so young an age (just 1% of what it is today) is via electromagnetic radiation from the intergalactic medium between the stars and black holes. Today, this is hot and ionized plasma, but in the early Universe it was a vast reservoir of cold neutral Hydrogen gas that fed the formation of the first stars and black holes and radiated long wavelength radiation copiously.<br/><br/>The LEDA project seeks to apply frontier radio astronomical techniques to make the first detection of this signal. LEDA will build a ""radio camera"" for deployment to the Long Wavelength Array, a radio telescope in New Mexico whose first 100m-diameter aperture was recently completed. The LEDA camera will combine several innovative technologies and data analysis techniques, giving students and young scientists the opportunity to join in cutting-edge science and development of the most advanced tools. In particular, LEDA will harness the massive computing power and flexibility of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) - the engines that power video games - to make instantaneous images of nearly the whole sky at up to 10 meters wavelength (10 million times longer than visible radiation).<br/><br/>From these images the light of our and other galaxies will be subtracted with high accuracy, enabling a search for signals from the dawn of the Universe. LEDA will push the frontiers of cosmology while contributing groundwork for future radio astronomical facilities where massive computing and signal processing systems will be lynchpins. Cross-disciplinary outgrowths of the LEDA effort will benefit astronomical, computational and solar sciences."

0.12,"High-energy physics and particle astrophysics are very dynamical fields, with new data revealing evidence of physics beyond the standard model through neutrino oscillations, dark matter and dark energy. This project is aimed at advancing the theoretical understanding of such aspects of physics beyond the standard model and at maximizing the amount of information that can be obtained from the experimental data by considering new analysis frameworks and exploring new connections between different phenomena. A significant effort in high energy physics is dedicated to extending the evidence for neutrino oscillations that has accumulated over the past decade. As part of this effort, the PI plans to work on optimizing the next generation of neutrino experiments and developing a better framework for understanding the experimental data and its implications for theoretical models. <br/><br/>Theoretical model building is addressed by emphasizing connections between implications for different observables in neutrino physics, collider physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Correctly interpreting available data and testing the underlying physics is extremely important and will be addressed in the project in the context of the MiniBooNE experiment.

0.06,"Present observations firmly support the notion that the early Universe underwent a short period of exponential) expansion known as inflation. The origin of matter is traced to the end of this inflationary era, when the primordial field that drives inflation transfers its energy into matter fields. This transfer is dramatic: it effectively models the hot Big Bang - and is believed to have occurred in at least two phases, known as preheating and reheating. The goal of this proposal is to address both the origin of matter and its excess over antimatter as inflation transitions into the hot Big Bang model. The PI plans to analyze in detail the nonperturbative dynamics of the preheating and reheating stages for a variety of models. . Based on this analysis, the PI hopes to propose several observational consequences of pre/reheating for different models, including: the number of e-folds or efficacy of the inflationary phase; the generation of net baryon number; and the production of a stochastic background of gravitational waves. The broader impact of the research is that the fundamental questions about the Universe addressed in this proposal are of great interest to wide ranging research groups and to the general public.. Apart from training his own graduate students, the PI is actively engaged in disseminating science to the general public through lectures, books, and TV documentaries.

0.304899,"AST-0071235<br/>Olinto, Angela V.<br/>The Origin of the Highest Energy Particles<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to conduct theoretical investigations into the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays (UHE cosmic rays, with E > 5x 1019 eV). Using plausible scenarios for the production and propagation of these energetic particles (ranging from young neutron star winds to AGNs), Olinto and co workers will study several types of acceleration models and also model the propagation of different types of particles which may make up the UHE cosmic rays. Using these different models, they will generate predictions (of for example energy spectrum and relative isotropy) for comparison with the data obtained by such experiments as the Pierre Auger Project, the High Resolution Fly's Eye, the Japanese Telescope Array, and the OWL-Airwatch experiment.<br/><br/>Occasionally a subatomic particle enters the atmosphere with so much energy that it produces a giant cascade of many tens of billions of secondary particles which can be observed by very large detectors on Earth. The particles that produce these giant air showers have been accelerated to far greater energies than can be achieved with terrestrial machines indicating incredibly powerful astronomical accelerators previously unforeseen. The explanation for the origin of these highestenergy particles remains unclear with a number of possibilities being proposed and constrained as the observations accumulate. The possibility that these particles come from the edge of the observable Universe is limited by the presence of the microwave background that fills all of space and degrades the energy of such high energy particles. The microwave background limits the location of these fantastic cosmic accelerators to relatively nearby in cosmological terms. The most plausible proposals range from supermassive black holes in centers of nearby galaxies to decaying particles left over from the Big Bang. The goal of this project is to try and find the answer by studying most plausible proposals in detail and model aspects of the propagation from source to Earth. Propagation studies will be intimately related to the knowledge of magnetic fields in the largest scales presently observed and particle physics models of interactions at the highest energies. Among plausible sources, we will investigate many models ranging from the most nearby possibility that these particles are iron accelerated in young neutron stars in the disk of our own Galaxy to the possible effects of large extra-dimensions on the physics of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. <br/>Funding for this project is provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC) and the Division of Physics Theoretical Physics Program.<br/><br/>***"

0.1,"The evidence is now overwhelming that ~ 25% of the mass-energy density of the universe is in the form of ""dark matter"". Discovering the nature of this dark matter is one of the most important questions in physics and cosmology. Perhaps the most compelling idea is that dark matter is composed of subatomic particles known as weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, that were created in the big bang. They most likely have a mass roughly the same as an atom of gold, but are effectively incredibly small and difficult to detect. Such particles are a generic prediction of supersymmetry, the best-motivated theory for particle physics at higher energy scales than has been probed so far in accelerators. Probing for supersymmetry is one of the principle goals for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. <br/>If WIMPs do exist, they must also be the dominant mass in our galaxy, and should be detectable from interactions in detectors on Earth. The rate of these interactions can be roughly predicted from the same physics that governs their production in the big bang, and is unfortunately small: somewhere between roughly 1 event/kg/month and 1 event/ton/year. Ambient backgrounds in particle detectors, both from radioactivity and cosmic rays, are much larger than this. Current searches have only just achieved sensitivity to the highest of these possible rates.<br/>The XENON collaboration has developed a new generation of dark matter detector based on liquid xenon. Like the current leading detectors, this technology has the ability to distinguish most radioactive backgrounds (gamma rays and betas), which cause an electron to recoil after the detector is struck, from WIMPs, which cause a nucleus to recoil. However it promises to more readily be scaled to the ton-scale needed to fully test the WIMP hypothesis than the current leading detectors, which have a mass of roughly 1 kg. <br/>The work funded here is participation in the XENON10, a ~10 kg prototype experiment which will be located in Gran Sasso, Italy. Our group is developing a system for removal of radioactive Kr which contaminates Xe, and is also developing a new method for removing other impurities that degrade the performance of the detector. Our group will also be involved in the design and construction of the detector, in particular wire grids used to measure ionization produced by WIMPs, and work on a CsI system for measuring scintillation. Finally, we will be involved in data taking operations and analysis.<br/>The nature of dark matter is one the most important questions in physics and cosmology, and is of great interest to the public at large. Our group will be actively engaged in public outreach, especially with local schools. Education and training of both undergraduate and graduate students is fundamental to this work, and students will have major roles in the proposed research. The technical aspects of experimental physics are a good foundation for a wide range of careers that benefit the public good. The specific techniques of very low background particle detection also have an important national security role in nuclear non-proliferation verification. Our group has been actively engaged in a joint effort between academic physicists and physicists in the defense non-proliferation community to develop advanced next-generation low radioactive background screening facilities. This work will indirectly benefit this effort."

If WIMPs exist, they are also the dominant mass in our own Milky Way. Although they very rarely interact with conventional matter, they should nonetheless be detectable by sufficiently sensitive detectors on Earth, through their direct interaction with, and the ensuing recoil of, nuclei in a target.

A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang.

0.11,"The proposed research involves addressing the fundamental problems both theoretical and experimental facing any quantum theory of gravity. The Hawking paradox, the cosmological constant problem and the breakdown of classical general relativity during gravitational collapse all arise because of a lack of understanding of how classical space-times emerge from quantum degrees of freedom at short distances. The PI intends to address this problem by considering string theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times. The PI is also interested in connecting String Theory with Experimental Cosmology. The PI is pursuing the possibility that non-renormalizable corrections to the kinetic energy terms of the inflaton responsible for inflation are potentially observable. The PI is also pursuing string theory models with warped compactifications that would contain a new type of dark matter particle."
3.2,"The discovery of dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and elementary particle physics. A broad range of observations indicate that 80 to 90% of the matter in the universe is in some new form of matter. The resulting Standard Cosmology holds that a quarter of the energy density of the universe is a new fundamental form of matter not yet encountered in the laboratory, and most of the remainder is dark energy. The solution to this mystery may lie in the existence of some new generic class of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, whose existence is also motivated by physics beyond the standard model of particle interactions. WIMP detection experiments require operation deep underground to prevent cosmic ray interactions from causing false positive signals. <br/> The LUX and ZEPLIN collaborations, building on their pioneering efforts in liquid xenon (LXe) dark matter detectors and their broad expertise in low background techniques and rare event searches, propose here a plan for the design of a 20-ton LXe detector (LZ20). The LZ20 detector will use established two-phase LXe technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification together with 3d position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the LXe, removal of surface artifacts and calibration of position dependent response functions. This detector, installed at the 4850 level, with a fiducial mass of 13.5 tons and an initial operating period of 1000 days, will suppress internal and external backgrounds from electromagnetic and neutron interactions to below a single event and achieve a sensitivity to WIMP-interactions down to cross section of 10 to the power negative 48 cm2. At this exposure, the sensitivity will begin to encounter irreducible backgrounds from solar and atmospheric neutrino interactions this experiment therefore represents the definitive WIMP search that can be performed with liquid Xe.<br/><br/>Regarding Broader Impacts Dark Matter science is broadly appealing to the public, building on the natural curiosity of the public as well as the connection and familiarity with gravity. The collaboration proposes to develop a range of activities, from tours and displays to partnerships with local schools and individuals, to foster an interest in science and science careers. Dark matter experiments demand the development of new technologies that are ultra-sensitive to radiation, and new methods for achieving ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. There is an overlap of these technologies and methods with those used in a wide range of nuclear security contexts. Through direct technology development or through the training of personnel that transfer to industry or defense labs later in their careers, the collaboration expects significant impact from LZ20 particularly because of the involvement of LLNL. This proposal includes a description of postdoctoral mentoring plans."

This team will conduct long-term observations of these variables in several nearby galaxies, in order to get an improved census of these objects, elucidate the mechanisms that may be responsible for giant eruptions, and to better understand the mechanism of mass loss and how stars evolve as they experience episodic (rather than steady) mass loss.<br/><br/>Modern supernova surveys are finding a number objects in nearby galaxies which are not true supernovae, the ""supernova impostors,"" which may be objects like eta Carinae that shed 10-20 times the mass of our Sun in a few years.

A<br/>notable feature in their study is that, although compactness may<br/>fail, existence may be achieved as a consequence of two key<br/>inequalities: the first inequality, called by them the<br/>Substantial Inequality, ensures the existence of at least one<br/>topological minimizer; the second inequality, giving an optimal<br/>sublinear upper growth estimate for the Faddeev energy in terms<br/>of the associated topological charge, implies the existence of an<br/>infinite family of topological minimizers, hence the existence of<br/>the Faddeev knots. This progress opens new directions for<br/>achieving a higher level of understanding of various unsettled<br/>aspects of the Faddeev knots, including the existence of<br/>unit-charge unknots (ring-like solitons), existence of<br/>high-charge knots and their stability, and transition pictures of<br/>knots in view of their topological and energetical<br/>characteristics. The similarity between the Faddeev energy and<br/>the Skyrme energy may be exploited to tackle the difficult<br/>existence problem of the Skyrme solitons. Indeed, a by-product of<br/>the work of F. H. Lin and the PI will be a proof of the<br/>existence of unit-charge Skyrme solitons which corrects the<br/>flawed (but well-known) proof of M. Esteban published in 1986.<br/>This study may also be extended to the Skyrme model in two<br/>spatial dimensions which has applications in condensed matter<br/>physics and cosmology. This project also suggests new directions<br/>for the study of the existence problems of global energy<br/>minimizers with topological characteristics in other important<br/>related areas.<br/><br/>The concept of knots is of foundational importance in<br/>science. For example, Lord Kelvin first explored the idea of<br/>using knots to model atoms and molecules. More recently, the<br/>concept of knots has inspired various fundamental areas,<br/>including particle and condensed-matter physics, statistical<br/>mechanics, cosmology, molecular biology, and synthetic chemistry.<br/>Up until recently, mathematical work had been focused on<br/>topological and combinatorial classifications of knots, but not<br/>on existence. In 1995, Faddeev and Niemi started a seminal study<br/>on the existence of knots as the soliton solutions of a quantum<br/>field theory model known as the Faddeev model using high-power<br/>computer simulations. The proposed work develops a mathematical<br/>existence theory of such knots. This work will give new insight<br/>into the mathematical structure of knots and their computer<br/>realization."
0.04,"In order to explore the implications of proposed theories of quantum gravity for space and time, it is often useful to study the theories' effects for special space-times. Symmetric solutions and related models present one of the main examples of this approach, motivated by the wish to extract physical information from (classical or) quantum gravity. While proposed quantum gravity theories are sufficiently complex that how to construct symmetric models is not obvious, several techniques have been developed for one of the current candidates for a quantum theory of gravity, loop quantum gravity. For realistic situations, which are never exactly symmetric, more general constructions containing at least small deviations from symmetry such as spatial inhomogeneities will be developed. This generalization may allow calculation of quantum gravity effects which might be relevant to cosmological observations or to understand properties of black holes.<br/>Since quantum theories of gravity are still being developed, any information on the behavior of possible candidates, in particular in physical scenarios, will help to guide the theoretical construction. Quantum gravity, in turn, is widely believed to be essential for the understanding of the universe at a fundamental level. This applies in particular to the two main areas of application of application of the simplified, cosmology and black holes, which also receive wide interest in the general public. Models as developed by this project enable intuitive explanations which make such a broad dissemination possible. In simplifying the complex full theories, suitable models also provide ideal entry points for students or researchers new to the field."

0.148752,"Stationary random fields play a fundamental role in both theoretical and applied spatial statistics. Unfortunately, stationarity is often violated when working with real data. This presents a challenge for the spatial statistician who is interested in estimating and modeling dependence structure in random fields. The investigator and his collaborator will study, and subsequently apply, a recently developed version of local likelihood estimation for estimating parameters that govern the local dependency in nonstationary random fields. The application is to use local likelihoods for the estimation of the local distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) due to gravitational lensing. Detecting and estimating this lensing is important for two reasons. First, measuring the distortion gives an indirect measurement of matter in the Universe which can provide detailed maps of the distribution of Dark Matter. Secondly, one can use the estimates of gravitational lensing to obtain a more accurate measurement of the un-lensed CMB. This will provide scientists with a deeper probe of fundamental cosmological questions. Specific aims of this proposal include: 1) develop computational techniques which will make local likelihood estimation applicable to large data sets such as the CMB; 2) develop the theory of estimating equations for local weight construction with a particular focus on mitigating bias and automatically adjusting for boundaries and uneven observation locations; 3) construct estimates of uncertainty in the local likelihood estimates of the parameter function; 4) use the principle irregular term to develop flexible and universal local models for general nonstationary random fields. <br/><br/>Nonstationary random fields are becoming a ubiquitous feature in the recent data deluge and high resolution sensing. Unfortunately, the techniques for modeling, estimating and predicting nonstationary random fields have yet to be fully developed and analyzed. This proposal will make steps towards the goal of developing a complete set of methodological techniques for analyzing nonstationary random fields. Moreover, the tools thus constructed will be useful, not only for Astronomy and Cosmology, but other branches of science and technology as well. This makes the broader impact of the scientific consequences of this proposal two fold. On the one hand, accurately estimating gravitational lensing in the CMB has far reaching consequences for the understanding of cosmic structure and the beginnings of the Universe. On the other hand, the tools from this project are expected to have broad use in other areas of real world application. Recently developed technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging are two examples of other scientific areas that will benefit from the methodologies developed for nonstationary random fields."

To bridge the 8 orders of magnitude in scale between them, these calculations will be linked by runs at intermediate scale using a 'zoom-in' technique of successively re-simulating an interesting volume at much higher resolution. Black holes are included in the largest-scale simulations both as sink particles that grow in mass by merging and by accreting gas, and as sources of energy, momentum and ultraviolet radiation. Both 'sink' and 'source' terms will be represented by approximate formulas; the model predictions will be compared with observations of the intergalactic gas, and the numbers of active galactic nuclei seen at each redshift. As a novel aspect, the PI will calculate how the ultraviolet radiation of young stars and active nuclei propagates out into the intergalactic gas. Galaxy-scale simulations will be used to find how fast gas will flow into the inner galaxy. This provides an outer boundary condition for the last calculation, which describes the accretion disk around the central black hole. At this last stage, the group can calculate how much radiation and momentum the black hole should inject back into the gas of the galaxy. These will be the first calculations of how a black hole feeds and shines, when it is in the center of a galaxy that is itself merging with others according to cosmological predictions.<br/><br/>A graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow will be trained by their involvement in the research.

Using these complementary approaches in tandem, the researchers will focus on the connection between cosmological initial conditions and key physical processes, explore the role of the local environment (such as tidal torques), study rare halos forming from atypical but allowed conditions, and attempt to reverse engineer halo formation to sort out which initial conditions and dynamical mechanisms are responsible for real, observed halos.<br/><br/>To try to encourage understanding of dark matter halos at all levels of education and research, all of the programs developed for the analytical procedure will be made publicly available, which should represent a powerful educational opportunity.

0.421671,"This project focuses on searches for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). In particular, searches will be conducted by cross-correlating the data acquired by the LIGO observatories during the latest LIGO science run (S5), and during the upcoming science run (S6) which will take advantage of the better sensitivity of LIGO detectors. These searches will establish the world's most sensitive measurements of the energy density of gravitational waves. Moreover, a study will be performed to assess the gravity gradient noise for Advanced LIGO: the gravity gradient noise is expected to limit the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO detectors at lowest frequencies, which are most sensitive to the SGWB.<br/><br/>The SGWB is expected to be produced in the earliest stages in the history of the Universe. Hence, direct observation of the SGWB would provide a glimpse of a very young Universe, much younger than what is possible using other astrophysical techniques. It would also represent a very rare probe of the particle physics of the highest energies, currently not accessible to accelerator-based particle physics experiments. The SGWB could also be produced by a large number of violent astrophysical events, such as gamma ray bursts or supernovae. Hence, direct observation of the SGWB would provide information about these exotic events as well. This project will allow undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars to be directly involved in this very exciting field of cosmology and astrophysics, and to make significant contributions to them.

1.833707,"Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background radiation tell us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter would be of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from backgrounds.

Such a horizon boundary scheme is expected to have major impact on the numerical study of black holes. The theme of the research is on the numerical study of black hole spacetimes.

The work will shed light on a poorly understood aspect of Maya culture and will increase understanding of the mechanisms used by this traditional society to bind together large numbers of individuals into functioning social units.<br/><br/>During fieldwork in 2009 and 2010, Mr. Slater and colleagues identified over 70 previously unrecorded caves in the region - virtually all of which exhibit signs of ancient ritual activity including the presence of petroglyphs, offerings, and sacrificial implements dating from 500 BC to 1600 AD. Under the current award he will map and excavate eight of those caves. The research seeks to develop a better understanding of the concepts of sacred landscape and cosmology among the ancient Maya, and how such notions were used by the elite class for the production and maintenance of social and religious power. <br/><br/>Caves held a significant role in ancient Maya ideology and cosmology as early as the Late Pleistocene (c. 10,000 BC). In the Maya belief system caves were viewed as the underworld, the point of emergence during creation, the locus of rain production, and the abode of powerful deities and ancestors. Thus, caves would have been viewed as places of potent spiritual energy and would have been ceremonially utilized by the ruling class.<br/><br/>Mr. Slater's research will test two hypotheses concerning the ritual use of space. First, he will examine the notion that the elite class had the ability to control access to caves both within the core of settlements and in hinterland areas. Secondly, Slater postulates that naturally diverse areas within caves were used for diverse forms of ritual. He will compare and contrast artifact assemblages and non-portable culture materials (e.g. petroglyphs) from caves located within settlements versus those outside, as well as from spaces located within caves, particularly open areas such as mouths versus constricted dark alcoves. This analysis will serve to develop a better understanding of the reach of elite control over hinterland areas, while simultaneously leading to greater insight into the differential use of ritual space based on both natural cave properties and culturally constructed notions of their importance. <br/><br/>In addition to contributions to the field of anthropology, the project will have impact in terms of education. Mr. Slater has served as an educator at Phillips Academy since 2002 and has used his research as a pedagogical tool in both classroom and field settings with students from high school age to the graduate level. The project has and will continue to train workers in skills that render them marketable to future projects, and to empower locals by offering them a scientific education that complements traditional knowledge of their Maya heritage."

Using plausible scenarios for the production and propagation of these energetic particles (ranging from young neutron star winds to AGNs), Olinto and co workers will study several types of acceleration models and also model the propagation of different types of particles which may make up the UHE cosmic rays. Using these different models, they will generate predictions (of for example energy spectrum and relative isotropy) for comparison with the data obtained by such experiments as the Pierre Auger Project, the High Resolution Fly's Eye, the Japanese Telescope Array, and the OWL-Airwatch experiment.<br/><br/>Occasionally a subatomic particle enters the atmosphere with so much energy that it produces a giant cascade of many tens of billions of secondary particles which can be observed by very large detectors on Earth. The particles that produce these giant air showers have been accelerated to far greater energies than can be achieved with terrestrial machines indicating incredibly powerful astronomical accelerators previously unforeseen. The explanation for the origin of these highest<br/>energy particles remains unclear with a number of possibilities being proposed and constrained as the observations accumulate. The possibility that these particles come from the edge of the observable Universe is limited by the presence of the microwave background that fills all of space<br/>and degrades the energy of such high energy particles. The microwave background limits the location of these fantastic cosmic accelerators to relatively nearby in cosmological terms. The most plausible proposals range from supermassive black holes in centers of nearby galaxies to decaying particles left over from the Big Bang.

Specifically, the investigators will focus on inference for the dark energy equation of state and on identifying filamentary structures from point process data such as that produced by galaxy surveys. The first problem gives rise to a challenging nonlinear inverse problem and demands a nonparametric approach, given what little is known about the dark energy equation of state. The investigators will develop new theory for nonlinear inverse problems that allow for accurate estimates and sharp confidence statements about the unknown function. These techniques will then be applied to Type Ia supernova data, possibly combined with other data sources, to make inferences about dark energy. The second problem gives rise to challenging spatial and inference problems. Current theory in the statistical literature applies to a single filament only, and techniques in the astronomical literature are not supported by theory. The investigators on this project will close that gap, developing theory for defining, identifying, and making inferences about the filamentary structures. The investigators will test this technique and apply it to galaxy survey data.<br/><br/>One of the most important problems in cosmology is understanding dark energy.<br/>The relationship between observable quantities and dark energy produces a challenging nonlinear inverse problem. With very little strong a priori information about the nature of dark energy, parametric approaches to the problem are limited and suboptimal.

The investigators will develop new theory of inference for such problems, with a focus on estimation under shape constraints, sharp hypothesis testing, and accurate confidence sets. The goal is a substantial improvement in accuracy over the current best techniques. In particular, the investigators will focus on the problem of understanding dark energy and on identifying filamentary structures in distribution of matter. The former is one of the central problems in modern cosmology and demands state of the art statistical techniques to get the most from the data. The investigators will develop new statistical theory and methodologies that substantially improve the precision with which features of dark energy can be estimated from supernova data and other data sources. The latter problem is central to understanding the distribution of matter in the universe.

0.105,"The brief period in the early universe from the end of inflation until the development of a thermalized plasma is one of the least understood eras in cosmology. During that era, which is known as ""reheating,"" the particles, fields, and effective low-energy interactions we see today all developed, but the high-energy physics required to describe that time is not known and modeling reheating requires large-scale numerical computations. The PI has coauthored LATTICEEASY, the most widely used program for simulating the reheating era. Most simulations to date, however, have been limited to unrealistically simple models of interacting scalar fields. The PI intends to extend the capabilities of his code to run on clusters of parallel processors and to include gauge fields in its calculations. Using those extended capabilities he will simulate reheating in complex models of high-energy physics and extract testable predictions. An understanding of preheating is important because it introduces extra ""handles"" (gravitational waves, topological defects) that one might use to constrain the physics involved in inflation. Other observables related to inflationary physics such as the CMB provide constraints on inflation models, but by their nature don't tell us anything about how the inflaton couples to other fields. Information about the couplings will be crucial if we are to move beyond phenomenological models of inflation and really start talking about embedding the inflaton in a model capable of making contact with other areas of particle physics. <br/>The PI intends to develop a program for training undergraduate students in numerical computation. This will include involving undergraduate research assistants in writing and running numerical simulations, creating computational units for two of the required courses in the Smith physics major and developing a course on computation built around examples drawn from the PI's cosmological research."
0.321593,"Silk, Joseph 96-17168 Dr. Silk will research several fundamental problems in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology that focus on the cosmic microwave background. One representative problem is the study of the angular anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation in different cosmological models, where the small observed deviations from anisotropy probe the origin of the large-scale structure in the universe. A second example is the study of galaxy formation and evolution. Improving models for the global star formation rate and application to the early evolution of disks and protogalaxies will aid predictions of their luminosity, spectral and chemical evolution."

The acquisition of large sets of high quality astronomical data, coupled with the availability of increasingly powerful supercomputers, has transformed the subject of the origin and evolution of structure in the universe profoundly. Models for the growth of structure incorporating Particle Physics candidates for the dark matter in the universe can now be confronted with detailed observational data. To study the critical non-linear evolutionary epochs in the universe requires three-dimensional many particle simulations with large dynamic range. The PI has developed a hierarchical N-body code with much improved dynamic range in both length and mass, and which is also much faster than previously available codes.

0.671494,"This grant is to search for a unified theory of the fundamental laws that apply universally to all physical systems, which has been a longstanding challenge and goal for physics. A current view is that there are two parts to any ""final theory"" of these basic laws. The basic dynamical law (for example string theory) is one part; a theory of the initial quantum state of the universe is the other. The dynamical law predicts regularities in time; the initial condition predicts regularities in space, in particular the regularities that occur on large, cosmological scales. The research that will be supported by this grant thus bears directly on these longstanding, basic physical questions.

0.08,"Dr. Eisberg is examining the life of the astronomer, Beatrice Tinsley (1941-1981). Despite her short career, Tinsley is significant to both the intellectual and the social history of science. Tinsley's career exemplifies many of the most striking difficulties encountered by female scientists. Nevertheless, she played a central role in originating the modern study of the evolution of stellar populations and galaxies, now among the most active fields of astronomy, and a field with crucial links to cosmology. Dr. Eisberg's study promises to place Tinsley's scientific work in context of the history of stellar and galactic astrophysics and cosmology as well as the history of women in science. She has access to Tinsley's large collection of scientific papers and family correspondence. She is also able to conduct interviews with many of Tinsley's surviving colleagues. This study will allow Dr. Eisberg to explore gender differences in the practice of science as well as the social and intellectual history of astronomy. Thus, it promises to have significance not just for STS scholars, but also astronomers and those interested in the advance of women in science."
0.254793,"The PI proposes to work on three projects in differential geometry and analysis on manifolds. These involve both linear and nonlinear aspects of geometric analysis. Geometric flows, such as those addressed in this proposal, have applications to many branches of science, including materials science and cosmology. The research in this proposal will enhance the theoretical understanding of such flows. The Ricci flow is fundamental in modern geometry. Most of the work on Ricci flow has been done on smooth Ricci flows or Ricci flows with surgery. On the other hand, many partial differential equations have a well-defined class of singular solutions. The proposed work will explore a remarkable class of singular solutions for the three-dimensional Ricci flow. Similarly, for many partial differential equations, there are good notions of weak solutions. Understanding limits of Ricci flow with surgery may shed light on the problem of developing a good notion of weak Ricci flow. The Einstein flow is a geometric flow with very different features than parabolic flows. The proposed research will elucidate some general features of the Einstein flow. The long-time behavior of vacuum spacetimes is of evident interest in cosmology. Finding a framework for differential K-theory based on infinite-dimensional cocycles will lead to new directions in local index theory and the associated functional analysis. It may also have topological consequences.<br/><br/>There are three main topics in this proposal.(1) Singular Ricci flows. In joint work with Kleiner, the PI has shown that there is a limit of Perelman's Ricci flow with surgery, as the surgery parameter goes to zero. The PI proposes to study refined properties of such limits, and more generally of singular Ricci flows.(2) Einstein flow. The Einstein flow is a flow which describes the long-time behavior of a vacuum spacetime that has a foliation by constant mean curvature spatial hypersurfaces. The PI will use techniques from collapsing theory in order to understand the geometry of the Einstein flow in the collapsing case.(3) Differential K-theory. Differential K-theory is a topological theory that combines K-theory with differential forms. In joint work with Gorokhovsky, the PI will construct infinite-dimensional models of differential K-theory."
1.262865,"This proposal covers many interrelated topics aiming to answer truly fundamental questions in theoretical physics. Among them: what is the correct gravity theory at large (cosmic) distances? What is quantum gravity? What is its energy scale? How (in)distinguishable are black holes? What is the origin of and solution to the hierarchy problem? The group consists of four theorists who work both separately and together on these fundamental questions. <br/>Porrati intends to undertake a systematic study of general theorems on interacting high-spin particles, both massive and massless. He proposes to extend previous results on back-reaction effects of gravity to understand their effects at short and large distances. He will work with G. Dvali and G.

Porrati will use his expertise in string theory, and his past work on the AdS/CFT duality to study simpler,<br/>potentially soluble models of quantum gravity in lower dimension.<br/>Gabadadze is planning to approach the cosmological constant problem, and the issue of cosmic acceleration within the paradigm of large distance modification of gravity. He will: search for brane induced gravity models that lead to an accelerated expansion. <br/>Sirlin plans to continue his studies of several aspects of precision electroweak physics and related concepts in Quantum Field Theory, and to pursue the search of signals and bounds for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

He is interested in how the dynamics behind the mechanism of stabilizing the weak scale will have consequences for LHC physics (such as, for example, production of mini black holes). He is also interested in theories of gravity that provide new physics at long distances, that on the one hand could explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and on the other can have testable experimental consequences.<br/>The PIs are involved in working with the NYU School of education on various outreach projects.

0.14,"This award funds the theoretical research activities of Professor Glennys Farrar at New York University.<br/><br/>Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR's) are cosmic rays (i.e., subatomic particles) with extreme kinetic energies that not only vastly exceed their rest masses, but also exceed the energies typical of other cosmic rays. These cosmic rays are significant for a number of reasons. First, the origin of their huge energies remains a mystery which touches on numerous aspects of astrophysics. Second, these huge energies vastly exceed those accessible in traditional accelerator experiments. Finally, the energies associated with such UHECR's often violate the so-called ""GZK bound"" which provides a theoretical upper limit on the energies that cosmic rays may have. Understanding how such UHECR's manage to violate the GZK bound is an important area of research. In her work, Professor Farrar aims to develop combinations of astrophysics analysis methods in order to constrain the sources and possible composition of UHECR's, using recent data from the AUGER experiment. She also wishes to use these techniques in order to map out the galactic magnetic field by exploiting massive new data sets of rotation measures of extragalactic sources in combination with synchrotron emission data from the WMAP experiment.<br/><br/>This work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. First, it will lead to the development of computational infrastructure (including the development of state-of-the-art techniques for optimizing fits involving many parameters and hundreds of millions of measured data points, new techniques for rapid simulation of particle cascades, and new probabilistic methods of event reconstruction that have implications for pattern recognition problems more broadly). Second, the PI will continue her work with the New York Schools Cosmic Particle Telescope (NYSCPT) Project (a partnership with local New York City schools): this includes further development of the next phase of NYSCPT as well as delivering public lectures on NYSCPT and mentoring NYSCPT participants."
0.304897,"There is strong cosmological and astrophysical evidence for non-baryonic, cold dark matter as a major constituent of the universe. The nature of Dark Matter, so far elusive, constitutes one of the most fundamental questions in science. Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology. A compelling explanation for what might constitute dark matter is the existence of hitherto unknown Weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), and a world-wide experimental effort is on-going to test this hypothesis. This project is part of that effort. <br/><br/>Immersive research experiences developed in collaboration with programs focused on underrepresented groups will enhance diversity at the graduate and undergrad levels. Innovative partnerships with Adler Planetarium and the School of the Art Institute in Chicago (SAIC) will bring Dark Matter science to broad and diverse audiences. Visitor experiences at the Adler Planetarium (450,000 visitors/year) will be enhanced by the participation of DAMIC scientists and the integration of visualizations of particle interactions with charge-coupled devices (CCDs).

0.825161,"Dr. Berlind will carry out a program to help strengthen two critical ""pipelines."" The first pipeline starts with measurements of galaxy clustering in redshift surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and ends in a physical understanding of cosmology and galaxy formation. The pipeline involves obtaining unbiased estimates of statistical and systematic errors, refining theoretical models used to fit the data, performing the fitting, and interpreting the results. A key tool required for every step in the pipeline is cosmological N-body simulations and associated mock galaxy catalogs. Dr. Berlind will complete the LasDamas simulations project and use it to enable the joint modeling of galaxy two-point, three-point, and group statistics in the SDSS. This should yield the strongest constraints to date on the relationship between galaxy properties and their underlying dark matter halos. The LasDamas simulations will also be used to study the detailed properties of dark matter halos with unprecedented precision.<br/><br/>The second pipeline is the one that produces professional astronomers from underrepresented minority groups. This pipeline has ""leaks"" at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate parts, resulting in a very poor production rate of minority PhDs. Dr. Berlind will put in place a series of programs designed to patch this leaky pipeline. These include (1) creating scholarships for K-12 students to attend summer camps at Dyer Observatory, (2) creating a scholarship to support undergraduate physics students at Fisk University, (3) running an undergraduate summer research internship, and (4) designing and teaching an intensive workshop on statistics and data analysis for Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge Masters students."

0.432876,"Technical Abstract<br/>The Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) project seeks to detect hyperfine emission from neutral Hydrogen (21 cm rest wavelength) in the intergalactic medium about 100 million years after the Big Bang (redshifts 16-40). A detection would deliver the first observational constraints on models of structure formation and on the formation of the first stars and black holes in the Universe. LEDA will develop and integrate signal processing instrumentation into the new first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). This comprises a large-N correlator serving all 512 dipole antennas of the LWA-1, leveraging a packetized CASPER architecture and combining FPGAs and GPUs for the F and X stages. Iterative calibration and imaging will rely on warped snapshot imaging and be drawn from a GPU-enabled library (CUWARP) that is designed specifically to support wide-field full polarization imaging with fixed dipole arrays. Calibration techniques will include correction for ionospheric refraction and direction dependent dipole gains, and exploration of pulsar data analysis to improve performance. Accurate calibration and imaging will be crucial requirements for LEDA, necessary to subtract the bright foreground sky and detect the faint neutral Hydrogen signal. From the computational standpoint, LEDA is a O(100) TeraFlop per second challenge that enables a scalable architecture looking toward development of radio arrays requiring power efficient 10 PetaFlop per second performance. Stage two of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA2) is one example.<br/><br/>Lay Abstract<br/>When did the first stars form? These stars are expected to be much more massive than the stars that are around us today. Did supermassive black holes form at the same time, earlier, or later? One of the great challenges of cosmology today is the study of these first generation objects. Their formation is widely hypothesized to have begun about 100 million years after the Big Bang, but no data are available to test this theory. The only available means to study the Universe at so young an age (just 1% of what it is today) is via electromagnetic radiation from the intergalactic medium between the stars and black holes. Today, this is hot and ionized plasma, but in the early Universe it was a vast reservoir of cold neutral Hydrogen gas that fed the formation of the first stars and black holes and radiated long wavelength radiation copiously.<br/><br/>The LEDA project seeks to apply frontier radio astronomical techniques to make the first detection of this signal. LEDA will build a ""radio camera"" for deployment to the Long Wavelength Array, a radio telescope in New Mexico whose first 100m-diameter aperture was recently completed. The LEDA camera will combine several innovative technologies and data analysis techniques, giving students and young scientists the opportunity to join in cutting-edge science and development of the most advanced tools. In particular, LEDA will harness the massive computing power and flexibility of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) - the engines that power video games - to make instantaneous images of nearly the whole sky at up to 10 meters wavelength (10 million times longer than visible radiation).<br/><br/>From these images the light of our and other galaxies will be subtracted with high accuracy, enabling a search for signals from the dawn of the Universe. LEDA will push the frontiers of cosmology while contributing groundwork for future radio astronomical facilities where massive computing and signal processing systems will be lynchpins. Cross-disciplinary outgrowths of the LEDA effort will benefit astronomical, computational and solar sciences."
0.232,"Neutrinos are amongst the most abundant particles in the Universe, they are keys to many astrophysical processes, and they may hold the key to explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. They are known to occur in nature in three types, or ""flavors."" It has also been observed that neutrinos could switch flavors through a process known as neutrino oscillation. From such oscillation experiments, it is found that neutrinos must have a mass. This is the first known indication that there is physics beyond the very successful Standard Model of Particle Physics. Neutrino mass remains one of the most important open questions in physics and so experiments are searching for ways to determine it since with their abundance they could play an important role in the evolution of our Universe. Direct laboratory determinations based on the precise measurement of the beta spectrum have been expanding over the past 80 years due to increasingly powerful electron spectrometry techniques. In 2009, the PI proposed a new technique by which the energy spectrum of low energy electrons can be extracted. The technique, known as Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), relies on the detection and measurement of coherent radiation created from the cyclotron motion of electrons in a magnetic field.<br/><br/>Knowledge of neutrino masses has broad implications for the scientific community, particularly in the fields of nuclear physics, particle physics, and cosmology. The CRES technique, being a general spectroscopic technique for low energy electrons, has broad applicability. Examples of possible application include detection of rare radioactive isotopes for nuclear non-proliferation, Fiertz interference term measurements, low energy electron-atom scattering, and high voltage metrology. The PI wishes to target undergraduate student participation in such research toward underrepresented minorities, particularly toward members of the Native American community.<br/><br/>After three years of research and development, the Project 8 experiment has successfully demonstrated the first detection of cyclotron radiation from single electrons. With the proof of principle firmly established, this award provides continued support for the next stage of the R&D program, moving toward a neutrino mass measurement from tritium beta decay. In particular, the next phase is to make a first measurement of a tritium beta spectrum in order to determine the scalability of the technique. Such a direct measurement in the sub-eV neutrino mass range is important for cosmology, the structure of the new Standard Model, and it will illuminate a key unknown in the search for neutrino-less double beta decay."

1.821,"At the high energy frontier in particle physics there are several key, unanswered questions. As yet undiscovered, more massive particles could explain a number of these mysteries. For example, in the universe today, there is much more ordinary matter than antimatter. However, no mechanism of known particle interactions can explain how the universe evolved from the matter-antimatter balance at the time of the Big Bang to the present, highly unbalanced, situation. By making precision measurements, it is possible to detect the echoes of such massive particles, common at the time of the Big Bang, in quantities like the electric dipole moment of the neutron, which just reflects the separation of the neutron's composite positive and negative charges. In addition to advancing our knowledge in particle physics and cosmology, and generating technological progress, this experiment will involve post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students as an essential part, affording the young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their education and training in a forefront area of nuclear physics.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>The neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) is an explicitly time-reversal-violating observable that has played an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics; measured upper limits continue to limit extensions of prevailing models. For example, at present, supersymmetry (SUSY) predicts a value of roughly 10^-25 e-cm for a SUSY mass scale of 1 Teraelectronvolt and maximal mixing. It is clear that measurements at the scale of 10^-28 e-cm as proposed here will provide important input at combinations of very high mass scales and small mixing angles. The neutron EDM is also important for understanding the general pattern of T-(CP-) violation and the cause of the observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the universe.<br/><br/>This experiment, to be performed at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline of the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL, is based on a technique that is qualitatively different from the strategies adopted in previous measurements. The basic technique in the present experiment involves formation of a three-component fluid of polarized neutrons and Helium-3 atoms dissolved in a bath of superfluid Helium-4 at a temperature T ~ 0.5 K. The ultracold neutrons in this volume, trapped in a plastic measurement cell, are produced by the collision of 8.9 Ångstrom neutrons with the phonons of the superfluid. The neutron and Helium-3 magnetic dipoles precess in the plane perpendicular to an applied external magnetic field, B0 in a traditional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance arrangement. The nEDM, dn, is determined by measuring the neutron precession frequency in the presence of a strong electric field, E0. Application of the electric field parallel (antiparallel) to B0 changes the Larmor precession frequency, nu, in proportion to dn. With B0 = 30 milliGauss and E0 = 50 kiloVolt/cm, nu = 88 Hertz and the frequency shift is 4.8 nanoHertz for an EDM of 10^-28 e-cm. Operationally, the neutron precession frequency is measured relative to that of the Helium-3 by taking advantage of the strongly spin dependent nuclear capture reaction and detecting the recoiling proton and triton via scintillation produced in the liquid Helium-4. The polarized Helium-3 atoms (in the same volume as the neutrons) also comprise a co-magnetometer (since any EDM of the Helium-3 atoms is suppressed by its atomic electrons); their precession is observed directly using SQUIDS.<br/><br/>This project provides important training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs as they participate in forefront physics research that stretches across areas including low temperature, atomic, nuclear and particle physics. The results of the experiment potentially impact particle physics as well as astrophysics and cosmology. Some technological developments are expected as several SBIR and STTR grants related to the experimental apparatus have been awarded to date."

0.326,"Evidence is mounting that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a dramatic superluminal ""Inflation"" of a sub-nuclear volume. This violent acceleration of matter would have produced a cosmic gravitational-wave background (CGB), the amplitude of which measures the energy scale of Inflation. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with an amplitude parameterized by the ratio of tensor to scalar modes, r = T/S. Many slow-roll models of Inflation produce r ~ 0.01?0.1, corresponding to peak CMB fluctuations of 30?100 nK rms on degree angular scales. Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey described the search for the CGB as ""the most exciting quest of all"", and emphasized that ""mid-term investment is needed for systems aimed at detecting the (B-mode) polarization of the CMB"". In 2005, the Task Force on CMB Research identified this as the highest priority for the field and established a target sensitivity of r = 0.02. The ongoing BICEP/BICEP2/SPUD series of experiments is dedicated to this science goal. They began operating at the South Pole Station (Antarctica) in 2006 and are relentlessly mapping an 800-deg2 region of the sky that uniquely low in Galactic foregrounds - the so-called Southern Hole. The combined sensitivity at 150 GHz (now greater than that of the Planck spacecraft) is concentrated on the Southern Hole increasing the ability to detect the CGB significantly. This award will support for three years the science observations and analysis with a new CMB polarimeter called BICEP3 - a third-generation compact refractor that will represent another breakthrough in per-receiver sensitivity. BICEP3 provides a further ten-fold increase in optical throughput compared to a single BICEP2/SPUD receiver. Populated with 2560 TESs at 95 GHz over three years of observing, BICEP3 will produce the most sensitive degree-scale CMB polarization maps of 95 GHz of any current or planned experiment. BICEP3 observations, when combined with SPUD's deep 150 GHz and 220 GHz coverage, will provide significantly more powerful discrimination between CMB polarization and Galactic foregrounds. Detection of the CGB would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB was to the Big Bang. Indeed its impact might be even broader, as Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science."

Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey described the search for the CGB as ""the most exciting quest of all"", and emphasized that ""mid-term investment is needed for systems aimed at detecting the (B-mode) polarization of the CMB"". In 2005, the Task Force on CMB Research identified this as the highest priority for the field and established a target sensitivity of r = 0.02. The ongoing BICEP/BICEP2/SPUD series of experiments is dedicated to this science goal. They began operating at the South Pole Station (Antarctica) in 2006 and are relentlessly mapping an 800-deg2 region of the sky that uniquely low in Galactic foregrounds - the so-called Southern Hole. The combined sensitivity at 150 GHz (now greater than that of the Planck spacecraft) is concentrated on the Southern Hole increasing the ability to detect the CGB significantly. This award will support for three years the science observations and analysis with a new CMB polarimeter called BICEP3 - a third-generation compact refractor that will represent another breakthrough in per-receiver sensitivity. BICEP3 provides a further ten-fold increase in optical throughput compared to a single BICEP2/SPUD receiver. Populated with 2560 TESs at 95 GHz over three years of observing, BICEP3 will produce the most sensitive degree-scale CMB polarization maps of 95 GHz of any current or planned experiment. BICEP3 observations, when combined with SPUD's deep 150 GHz and 220 GHz coverage, will provide significantly more powerful discrimination between CMB polarization and Galactic foregrounds. Detection of the CGB would be to Inflation what the discovery of the CMB was to the Big Bang. Indeed its impact might be even broader, as Inflation directly bears on the current frontiers of fundamental physics. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science."

This research will focus on using string theory to understand the workings of Nature at the shortest distance scales. Strings continue to have significant impact on theoretical physics, with interdisciplinary connections ranging from the physics of subatomic particles to pure mathematics. One of the most important open issues is how to connect this framework to experimentally verified theories of subatomic particles. This project aims to use the geometry of extra dimensions predicted by string theory to construct and study theoretical models of relevance both for theories of subatomic particles, and for more formal mathematical applications.<br/><br/>The education and outreach efforts of this program will introduce students to the power of geometric methods in theoretical physics. 1) At the postdoc and graduate level, the PI will maintain a collaborative research environment. 2) The PI will develop a course on geometric methods in high energy theory. 3) At the undergraduate level, the PI will advise students on geometric and computational aspects of string theory through the UNC REU program on computational methods in physics held in his department. 4) The PI will work closely with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center to develop a set of outreach modules aimed at conveying the broad range of energy scales which are actively being investigated by high energy theorists and experimentalists.<br/><br/>The technical components of this program will focus on the development of new tools in the study of string compactification at strong coupling, and the resulting low energy effective field theories. Particular emphasis will be placed on compactifications of F-theory. This will entail developing the correspondence between the open string degrees of freedom in the worldvolume theory of intersecting seven-branes, and closed string degrees of freedom captured by elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds. Additional components will entail the development of specific string-motivated scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Models of particle physics and cosmology. Particle physics applications will include the study of kinetic mixing with a strongly coupled extra sector. Cosmology applications will include the development of inflationary reheating scenarios coupled to concrete stringy particle physics models. This project will also focus on using the geometry of F-theory compactifications as a tool to classify and study superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in diverse dimensions. This will include a classification of 6D SCFTs, the construction of new 4D N = 1 SCFTs from D3-brane probes of singular Calabi-Yau fourfold geometries, and the development of 2D SCFTs with N = (0,2) supersymmetry from compactification on singular elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fivefolds."

Supernovae synthesize and expel heavy elements, thereby dictating much of the chemical evolution of galaxies. The ejecta of supernovae blast through the interstellar medium, heating it and giving rise to phenomena such as galactic fountains. Shock waves from supernovae may also trigger vigorous bursts of star formation through compression of dense molecular clouds. Supernovae are probably responsible for the production of some of the most energetic cosmic rays in the Universe. Certain types of supernovae are exceedingly useful for measuring distances of galaxies billions of light years away, and are playing a crucial role in determinations of the age, global structure, and evolution of the Universe. <br/><br/>This project will continue the efforts of Dr. Filippenko's group to improve the understanding of the progenitor stars, explosion mechanisms, nucleosynthetic products, and cosmological utility of different types of supernovae. The adopted approach is largely observational, coupled with theoretical modeling through several informal collaborations. A new major goal is to discover supernovae very shortly after the explosion. Current and new data will be assembled for the purpose of improving the use of supernovae for cosmology and for obtaining clues to the physical nature of supernova progenitors.<br/><br/>The results from this study will have broad implications for topics as diverse as the chemical evolution of galaxies, the masses of black holes, the nature of gamma-ray bursts, and the expansion of the Universe.

The study's objectives for understanding galaxy formation are to understand the physical origin of ICL and to quantify the size and stellar mass growth of BCGs. The objectives driven by cosmological considerations are to quantify the fraction of stellar baryons in the BCG plus ICL as a function of cluster mass and redshift and the cluster-to-cluster variation in this stellar baryon fraction and to conduct the definitive census of total (gas plus stellar) baryon fraction as a function of cluster mass.<br/><br/>Previous studies have had data limitations requiring several crude approximations, such as assuming a constant mass-to-light ratio for all cluster galaxies and using background subtraction rather than spectroscopic cluster membership to determine the total cluster galaxy luminosity. Previous work has also lacked the combination of gas and stellar baryon data for individual clusters. The proposed work will serve as a definitive survey that includes deep spectroscopy, X-ray data, and deep photometry for the galaxy population and ICL for a statistical sample of clusters, thereby replacing the earlier crude approximations with actual measurements governed by statistics---broadly important to the scientific community.<br/><br/>Educationally, the proposed activities will promote teaching and training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral associate.

Numerical simulations provide a means to address this problem. The PI is modeling the parameter space associated with numerical simulations of galaxy formation in groups and clusters. He is using two independent codes: the P3MSPH code developed by the PI, and the Virgo consortium's Hydra code These both run on parallel machines. The science objectives of the project are (1) what aspects of modeled clusters are numerically robust? (2) what processes determine the relative fractions of baryons in galaxies and the intracluster medium? (3) can a single model for galaxy formation reproduce the observed optical and x-ray characteristics of groups and clusters? (4) how do galaxies trace the total mass in clustered environments? This is a phased study to (1) investigate stability to numerical parameters, (2) to calibrate response to star formation and feedback prescriptions, (3) explore dependence across a spectrum of cluster sizes, (4) explore sensitivity to the cosmological model. ***"

These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, a paper about the research results targeting physics amateurs will be disseminated to a broad audience, including through a non-technical journal. Presentation of the research will be proposed at national and international general science and interdisciplinary conferences that even involve the arts disciplines. Coordination will be made with the Society of Physics Students at the author's home institution for launching an outreach program in the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) in Nashville, TN to make presentations at the 21 high schools and other schools where high school students are enrolled, which include the Baxter and Cohn Alternative Learning Centers, the MNPS Virtual School and the Cohn Adult High School. The students will be introduced to the mystery of dark energy and its pivotal stance. Then, the rest of the research will be presented in a systematic fashion through visual materials. Due to the ethnic and socio-economic demographics of the student population in MNPS, a significant number of under-represented minorities in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields will be reached."
0.499944,"AST-9984040<br/>HAMANN<br/><br/>Quasars (or QSOs) are bright beacons at the fringes of the observable universe. The light we measure today from the most distant of these objects was emitted when the universe was about 17% of its present age - roughly 1-2 billion years old. Spectroscopic studies show that even at these early times quasars contain heavy elements (or ""metals""'), presumably a synthesized by local stars. This project is a five-year program to use quasar elemental abundances as tracers of star formation and galaxy evolution at early cosmological epochs. The enrichment time scales and physical conditions inferred from the abundances (such as the ages, gravitational binding energies, and perhaps total masses of the star-forming environments) should also help constrain models of the cosmology itself. Early-epoch star formation and galaxy evolution are among the most active research topics in astronomy today. This program's emphasis on the abundances near QSOs will provide a vital complement to other studies that probe more extended structures or use very different data and analysis techniques. The results will be particularly valuable for their unique constraints on galactic nuclear evolution. It has been shown that reliable abundances and important star-formation properties can be derived from the intrinsic emission and absorption lines in quasar spectra. This program will test and expand upon those results by 1) including larger QSO data samples - with an emphasis on the earliest epochs, 2) developing and comparing more independent abundance diagnostics, 3) targeting specifically the relative iron abundances to constrain the enrichment time scales, and 4) comparing the QSO results directly to other studies of high-redshift star formation and galaxy evolution. The same data and analyses will also necessarily address a variety of problems concerning the QSOs themselves. The results of the investigations will allow one to address fundamental issues, such as the formation and evolution of QSOs, and the origin, location, dynamics and physical nature of their environments.<br/><br/>An integral part of the program is a long-range plan for education and public outreach. This plan includes 1) strategies for bringing science to K-12 students and the general public, 2) new interactive and ""hands-on""' programs for undergraduates, and 3) a mentoring plan for graduate students that will prepare them for a range of career options, including education, industry and academic research. The goal is to design projects for graduate student classes that will enhance their skills in ""practical"" applications, team management, communication and organization. Meetings with industry representatives will be arranged and the students will be sent out to local industry centers and industry representatives will be invited to visit the astronomy department. A weekly series of journal club talks (for students and faculty) will be organized and the graduate students will go out into local K--12 schools to participate in a program of public outreach. This outreach program will benefit the K-12 students by stirring their enthusiasm for science and by having the graduate students be examples of positive role models. The undergraduate education plan includes innovative classroom techniques such as ""concept testing,"" exposure to current research as part of the normal curriculum, and summer research projects for motivated juniors and seniors.<br/><br/>The Division of Astronomical Sciences provides support for this project.<br/><br/>***"

0.3,"This proposal requests support for a U.S. university-based contribution to the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) being carried out at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the U.K. Recent discoveries in the study of neutrinos suggest that a very intense neutrino source, or ""Neutrino Factory,"" might answer fundamental questions of particle physics and cosmology. This large future scientific project could be sited at an existing U.S. laboratory. MICE is an essential step towards this goal and will validate Neutrino Factory cost estimates by confirming the feasibility and performance of the key ""muon cooling"" technique. <br/><br/>Neutrinos were originally postulated as massless neutral particles emitted during beta decay of radioactive nuclei. When they were found to come in two (and, later, three) types, each type was assumed (based on observation) to be immutable. However, recent experimental results indicate that over sufficiently long distances, neutrinos oscillate from one kind into another. From this, it follows that neutrinos have nonzero masses. This discovery raises fundamental issues regarding the total amount of matter in the universe and the origin of the excess of matter over antimatter, and places a high priority on studies to deduce the parameters of neutrino oscillation, including possible Charge conjugation-Parity (CP) violation in neutrino mixing. Although neutrino-oscillation studies using accelerator-derived neutrino beams are now planned or under way, recent world-wide R&D work points to a Neutrino Factory, producing a novel neutrino beam via decay of an intense muon beam circulating in a storage ring, as the ideal tool for neutrino oscillation and CP-violation studies. Such a tool would permit sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond that of current and planned experiments. A Neutrino Factory would also be the first step towards muon-muon colliders in the longer term, with unique potential for studies of lepton collisions at the postulated Higgs resonance and the energy frontier. Muon beams at the required intensity can only be produced into a large phase space, but affordable existing acceleration technologies require a small input beam. This mismatch could be alleviated by ""cooling"" the muon beam to reduce its size. This is the goal of MICE and an international collaboration has been organized to carry it out. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this research include validation of an important new technique applicable in a variety of scientific and technological areas, including particle physics and cosmology; development of next-generation instrumentation; collaboration of interdisciplinary and international university and national-laboratory groups including accelerator and particle physicists and engineers; training of graduate and undergraduate students including those from community colleges and underrepresented minorities; and wide information dissemination via outreach activities and public media."

0.252211,"One of the highest priority science questions in cosmology today is how hydrogen gas was ""reionized"" when the Universe was young (known as the Epoch of Reionization, or EoR). This reionization is predicted by the Big Bang theory of the evolution of the Universe, but little is known about how this physically happened. <br/><br/>The investigator will further develop his Fast Holographic Deconvolution analysis software for the reduction of hydrogen gas EoR observations. Such observations have the potential to measure the rise and fall of the EoR power spectrum, placing meaningful constraints on models of reionization and early star formation. These constraints will have impact on the astrophysics community and could influence how James Webb Space Telescope observations are interpreted, constrain the optical depth of cosmic microwave background measurements, and aid our understanding of the early universe. This award will provide funding for a postdoctoral research associate to work on making the software available and usable by the general EoR community. The grant will enable an advanced software pipeline for the international radio cosmology community, and will provide sponsorship of a workshop to train the community in its use.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the work include training of a postdoc, and the engagement of under-represented groups toward careers in science, which has been a hallmark of Morales' group at U Washington for a number of years."
0.135,"Among the exciting events of recent years has been the mounting evidence that the very early universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion known as ""primordial inflation"". During primordial inflation there is a vast enhancement of quantum effects, which are ordinarily very small. Another significant feature of primordial inflation is that these quantum effects become fossilized so that they can be detected by current observers. The goals of this study are, among others, to work out how quantum effects arise from primordial inflation, to settle the long-standing controversy over whether or not the self-gravitation of particles produced during inflation can slow down the expansion of the universe and to investigate modified gravity theories which might describe the current universe.<br/><br/>Such a study is interesting because there is a vast reservoir of largely untapped data in the radiation from the very early structures which can be seen at great distances. This data offers sensitivity to energy scales and physical laws far beyond those that can be reached in accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. This project will promote teaching, training and learning. To this end, the PI will continue serving as a host in the University of Florida's Junior Science, Engineering and Humanities Symposium. These presentations typically involve simple explanations of, for example, why galactic rotation curves suggest dark matter. Then the PI discusses how students can prepare for a career in theoretical physics. The PI will also continue to deliver colloquia based on his 2009 review article, ""How Far Are We from the Quantum Theory of Gravity?"" in Reports on Progress in Physics. These colloquia are accessible to interested but non-specialist physicists, and to graduate students new to the field."
0.010464,"In the past decade new, more precise observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM)--the hydrogen and helium gas between the galaxies produced in the Big Bang--have revealed a discrepancy with the well-established predictions of our computational models. In particular, precision observations of the IGM using the Keck telescopes in Hawaii show that the temperature and ionization state of the IGM is not what our standard cosmological simulations predict: the IGM is either somewhat hotter than ultraviolet radiation from stars in galaxies can make it, or the IGM is distributed differently in space than the simulations predict, or both. There could be missing sources of heat in our models, such as energy injection by decaying dark matter particles. The discrepancy is perplexing since the standard model predicts the galaxy distribution exceedingly well. The discrepancy suggests that the standard model lacks some essential ingredient which we refer to simply as ""missing physics"". The significance of this project to the nation is that it promotes the progress of science in the fundamental field of cosmology where the US is a world leader. The project is addressing the issue of whether we are overlooking a key component of the mass-energy content of the universe. Precise answers require powerful tools, and the Blue Waters supercomputer is the tool for the job. <br/><br/>In this work, the investigators will systematically explore how the discrepancy between models and observations can be removed. They will carry out on the Blue Waters supercomputer simulations of unprecedented size and physical realism to hunt down what the missing physics is. Since the IGM comprises most of the volume and matter in the universe, a small discrepancy may translate into a big discovery. Very large 3D simulations are required because the range of scales in each dimension exceeds 4000:1. They will examine whether additional heating sources such as X-rays and ultraviolet light from early galaxies and quasars can make up the heat deficit. Alternatively, they will also examine whether the limited spatial resolution in current simulations explains the discrepancy by carrying out the first large-scale simulations of the IGM that also simulates the gas near to galaxies in detail."

This project is a tight combination of precision measurements of the intergalactic medium through absorption in quasar spectra with a suite of simulations designed to extract the physical parameters from those measurements. It will provide new estimates of cosmologically interesting parameters, including the baryonic, dark matter and dark energy contents, and the amount of clustering of matter on small scales, which are more accurate than those obtained before from the intergalactic gas, and completely independent of those from supernovae, galaxies and the cosmic microwave background. For all parameters the errors will be comparable to the best of any method. The work will also give much more accurate measurements of the temperature of the intergalactic gas, and the intensity of the ultraviolet background radiation. Sophisticated calibrations of spectra will make them suitable for determining which set of parameters makes the simulated spectra most like the real spectra. Some simulations will include radiative transfer so as to interpret absorption near to individual quasars.<br/><br/>This team has a long record of integrating education and diversity with their research.

0.559633,"This project probes the fundamental physics of neutrinos and nuclei by exploiting the intersection of exciting new developments in nuclear physics and neutrino physics on the one hand, and the increasingly sophisticated astrophysical and astronomical probes of compact objects, nucleosynthesis histories, and cosmology on the other. A key issue in this enterprise will be studying how neutrinos interact in dense matter and how these interactions may cause neutrinos to change their flavors. To these ends, this UCSD effort will work toward: (1) Formulating and understanding the quantum kinetic equations which govern neutrino flavor evolution in a general medium; (2) Constructing large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor evolution in various supernova, stellar collapse, and compact object merger environments and assessing the feedback of this neutrino flavor physics on the prospects for the synthesis of nuclei in these sites; (3) Understanding neutrino-nucleus interactions, nuclear partition functions, and weak strength distributions in high temperature environments; and (4) Assessing how uncertainties and new beyond-standard-model possibilities in the neutrino sector could impact ideas on nucleosynthesis, dark matter, compact object physics, and cosmology, with an eye toward finding constraints otherwise unobtainable in the laboratory.<br/><br/>The research supported in this project will provide insights into how atomic nuclei and radiation behave in extreme conditions of temperature and density. In turn, these insights could give important clues about the nature of some elementary particles and the origin of the elements, for example, in the fiery interiors of supernova explosions, or at the time when the universe was only seconds old. These are fundamental questions that will provide unique opportunities for the training of young scientists, nuclear physicists, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels."

Emphasis will be on a consistent formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and the back reaction of these fields on spacetime geometry, including study of structures of possible importance in early cosmology, as well as black holes and cosmological event horizons. The aim ultimately is to develop the statistical mechanics framework as a paradigm for all dynamical processes; therefore, formulation of the description of irreversible processes in the developing framework will be carried out.

0.025,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>The two deepest mysteries in our understanding of nature are: the selection of the initial conditions (IC) of our universe, and the recent acceleration of the universe, attributed to dark energy (DE). The PI proposes to study both of these outstanding problems, within a new framework that extends the conventional approach and which uses observational analysis for guidance on these phenomena and for the testable predictions of the program. The radical departure of the PI's approach from the conventional approach is that it proposes to use the quantum dynamics of the gravitational and matter fields degrees of, in a multiverse framework, for selecting the IC and for extracting the cosmological implications of the landscape. The PI advocates that the only way to address the problem meaningfully is by extending our investigation to a multiverse framework. This proposal is one way resolving the puzzle of why our universe had to start with High Energy Big Bang, while avoiding paradoxes born out of previous attempts. This approach also offers a multitude of testable predictions, tracked down by superhorizon entanglement modes, thereby placing it as a strong candidate for a scientific theory of IC. Three of these predictions are already successfully tested, with the most recent test being the NASA discovery of a ""dark flow"" in Sept.2008. Another topic of research concerns the puzzle: what is Dark Energy? Currently, the best way to tell is by observationally finding ways to measure its pressure and equation of state w[z].<br/>Although ranked among the highest priorities in the community, this measurement has proven difficult so far. The PI proposes a complementary method, namely the use of Gravitational Waves from SBH binaries for pinning down w. This method can be quite powerful since it avoids the noise in the signal that is inherited from the vastness of structure through which the signal propagates. Besides complementing current large-scale surveys, the benefit of this method is that we can start taking data immediately and make use of existing and planned LIGO and LISA experiments. The project has many broader impacts. The PI shares the excitement of her research by giving a series of talks nationally and internationally, and by talking to media in order to help make cutting edge research accessible to a wider audience. Together with Brian Greene and J.Khoury, the PI has initiated and is co-organizing a series of conferences, ""A Debate in Cosmology"", on these outstanding topics, meant not only to stimulate progress and breakthroughs by bringing together authorities in the field, but also for disseminating knowledge by having online video-cams of the talks. She is also co-editing a book on Time's Arrow (NYAS) and co-authoring invited chapters for Springer's ""Frontier"" collection meant to disseminate cutting edge research to the general public."

0.06,"The PI will study a class of quantum effects which take place during the phase of accelerated expansion known as ""primordial inflation."" These effects do many fascinating things such as changing the masses and field strengths of fundamental particles, and changing the rate at which the universe expands. An important property of these effects is that they grow with time until conventional approximation techniques break down. The PI will complete the development of a new technique with which this class of quantum effects can be evolved to arbitrarily late times. The work will involve reciprocal visits to collaborate with Professor Nikolaos Tsamis (University of Crete, Greece) and Professor Tomislav Prokopec (University of Utrecht, The Netherlands). Important projects will also involve the PI's graduate students: Miss Shun-Pei Miao and Mr.<br/>Emre Kahya.<br/>Some of these effects may give rise to currently observable consequences such as distortions in the spectrum of primordial perturbations, anomalously large populations of very long wavelength particles, and modifications of the gravitational force law.

0.48,"This collaborative award funds the research activities of Professors V.P. Nair and Alexios Polychronakos at the City College of the City University of New York and Professor Daniel Kabat at Lehman College of the City University of New York. <br/><br/>Gauge theories describe the interactions of all elementary particles. One particular gauge theory, known as Quantum Chromodynamics, describes the interactions of quarks and gluons. These are the elementary particles inside nuclei, which can bind to form nuclei as well as other yet-to-be-detected particles such as glueballs. While the interaction of quarks and gluons at very high energies is fairly well understood, a detailed understanding of how quarks and gluons bind together to form nuclei and glueballs, and why isolated quarks cannot exist (""quark confinement""), is far from complete. This research project will contribute in this direction by building on previously introduced techniques within the simpler context of gauge theories with two space dimensions. This research project will also develop new techniques for calculating the Casimir force, which arises from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and which is central to many techniques in nanomechanics. Finally, on another front, Professors Nair and Polychronakos will continue their work on statistical distributions of random matrices, with implications for a variety of questions from condensed-matter physics to quantum gravity. New physically observable quantities will be analyzed and their implications for quantum gravity will be explored.<br/><br/>This project will have significant broader impacts.

Johnson to work with Dr. Walter Gear at the University of Wales in Cardiff.<br/><br/>Recent measurements of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) from experiments like MAXIMA and WMAP suggest we live in a universe whose evolution is described by adiabatic inflationary cosmology dominated by cold dark matter and a cosmological constant. Given this fact, the CMB should be partially linearly polarized with the vector field on the sky consisting of a curl-free (E-mode) component and a divergence-free (B-mode) component. The E-mode component was predominantly produced by bulk motion in the primordial plasma at recombination arising from scalar perturbations; the B-mode component was produced by tensor perturbations resulting from inflationary gravity waves. A measurement of the angular power spectrum of the primordial B-mode polarization will yield the energy scale of inflation. B. R. Johnson is working as part of the Instrumentation Group at the University of Wales, Cardiff to develop polarimetric instrumentation for making high precision measurements of the polarization of the CMB. This instrument will be specifically designed to characterize the anticipated B-mode signals. The primordial B-mode signal is extremely faint and therefore difficult to detect. Likely instrument designs will employ hundreds of photon noise limited 300 mK bolometric detectors, a ~2 m reflecting telescope large enough to provide ~5 arcmin resolution at 150 GHz, and polarization modulation hardware.

Three aspects will be studied: First, a new 3.5 meter telescope with remote observing capabilities will be used to monitor the brightness of images in candidate and known lenses. The light curves will be used to measure the value of the Hubble constant, test the lens hypothesis for controversial systems, and detect microlensing events, which have implications about the nature of dark matter and the very small scale structure of quasars. Second, observations of new candidate lenses to be identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data sets will enable the assembly of a large (several hundred) well controlled statistical sample, thus allowing measures of fundamental cosmological parameters. Third, advanced cosmic simulation and numerical lensing codes will be employed to predict the lensing consequences of various scenarios for the formation and evolution of galaxies and large scale structure.

0.510901,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) makes up a mere 15% of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can only see gravitationally, appears to be dark. The goal of detecting and identifying dark matter is widely recognized as one of the most important problems in 21st century cosmology. Current particle physics models suggest that dark matter might be weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Efforts to directly detect WIMPs are hampered by small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds which mimic expected dark matter signals. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist which, if exploited, can be used to discriminate against backgrounds. These are based on the predicted behavior of the WIMP flux as the Sun-Earth system moves through the galaxy. The largest and most robust of these signatures is a day-night modulation of nuclear recoil directions in the lab frame. Of current experimental searches for dark matter only one, Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT), is equipped to detect this directionality signature. <br/><br/>The main subject of this proposal is to experimentally study novel detectors for future directionally sensitive dark matter detectors. These studies will focus on improving DRIFT's sensitivity for measuring directionality by taking full advantage of the directional signature from halo WIMPs while maintaining DRIFT's good background rejection capabilities, intrinsic low-maintainability, and low cost per unit mass. The goals of this research are to quantify the advantages and disadvantages of the new technologies by measuring their performance in the laboratory, and to assess the feasibility of employing these new technologies in future, large mass directional dark matter experiments.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include the training of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities). Additionally, a targeted Outreach Program for the professional development of middle- and high-school teachers will be developed. As part of this program, each year a 1-day workshop will be offered, followed by a 2-week intensive course, with graduate credit towards a M.A. in Education, for teachers across New Mexico.

This award supports research aimed at advancing the theoretical understanding of such aspects of physics beyond the standard model and at maximizing the amount of information that can be obtained from the experimental data by considering new analysis frameworks and exploring new connections between different phenomena. As part of this effort, the PI plans to work on optimizing the next generation of neutrino experiments and developing a better framework for understanding the experimental data and its implications for theoretical models. Another topic of research will be the study of models connecting neutrinos and dark matter/dark energy, with predictions for novel, interesting phenomena in both neutrino astrophysics and cosmology. The exploration of the possible connections between neutrinos and dark matter/energy candidates is now only beginning and the scenario discussed here provides a natural framework for the realization of such a connection.<br/><br/>High energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology and the questions they are trying to address are very exciting and capture the interest of a larger public, providing excellent outreach opportunities.

All the heavier elements, which astronomers refer to generically as ""metals,"" were made by nuclear reactions in the cores of stars, ejected at the ends of the lives of those stars, and then recycled into a next generation of stars and planets. We understand reasonably well how metals are made and ejected from stars, but relatively little about the path they take post-ejection. The goal of this proposal is to greatly improve our knowledge of this process, and thereby to understand the life cycles of the elements that make up our planet and our bodies. The project will involve computer simulations of the flows of metals through and potentially out of the disk of a galaxy. Within the scientific community, the results generated by this project will be of use to people studying both stars and cosmology, and the project itself will help train a new generation of scientists. The broader impact of the work involves a volunteer organization which teaches math and science to inmates in Santa Cruz County Jails.<br/><br/><br/>To address the question of how metals are transported through galactic disks, the PI, his collaborators, and students will carry out a campaign of simulations of both isolated shearing boxes and entire galaxies, including a variety of mechanisms for generating instability and transport. They will also conduct simulations of the launching of galactic winds by supernovae, in order to understand how supernova ejecta are or are not mixed with the ambient ISM on their way into a wind. The simulations will use either Athena or PENCIL for the isolated boxes, and ENZO for the whole galaxy and galactic wind calculations. The results of the simulations will be incorporated into a 1D galaxy evolution code in order to study the long-term radial distribution of metals, and both the 1D and full 3D results will be compared with observations. The simulation result will be expressed in the form of parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficients) suitable for other groups to use in semi-analytic models or full cosmological simulations that lack the resolution to model metal diffusion processes self-consistently, and thus must rely on subgrid models. The 1D galaxy evolution code is also open source, and is available for use by the community.

Several techniques to construct representative models have been developed for one of the current candidates for a quantum theory of gravity, loop quantum gravity. For realistic situations, which are never exactly symmetric, more general formulations containing at least small values of general fields such as inhomogeneities will be developed. This is essential for, e.g., predictions in cosmological observations or to understand properties of black holes. An analysis of the resulting equations will be carried out in order to arrive at consistency tests of the general framework as well as possible observable effects.<br/>Since quantum theories of gravity are still being developed, any information on the behavior of possible candidates, in particular in physical scenarios, will help to lead the theoretical construction. Quantum gravity, in turn, is widely believed to be essential for the understanding of the universe at a fundamental level. This applies in particular to the two main areas of applications, cosmology and black holes, which receive wide interest in the general public. Models as developed here allow the development of intuitive explanations which make such a broad dissemination possible.

Most of the matter is in a form unknown to us, and can be detected only through its gravitational pull. The nature of this ``Dark Matter'' is the single most interesting problem in contemporary theoretical physics, and its study involves the amalgamation of information from different disciplines, such as particle physics, astronomy, and cosmology. The present project aims to constrain the properties of this elusive dark matter by looking at ``bias'', the difference between the statistical properties of visible and dark matter.<br/><br/>According to current theories of structure formation, small initial fluctuations in the early Universe grew under the influence of gravity until the large-scale structures which, we see at the present day, formed. It appears that galaxies formed where the underlying dark matter concentrated in clumps (called halos). Thus, the present distribution of galaxies depends both on the distribution of dark matter and on the efficiency with which dark matter halos turn into galaxies. Novel statistical measures developed by Dr. Szapudi and his collaborators will be used to characterize the present-day distribution of galaxies using data from on-going wide field surveys (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) which encompass up to a million objects. Then the theory of bias will be applied to these measured distributions to constrain the distribution of the underlying dark matter.

0.294335,"AST-0236702<br/>Bernstein, Gary M.<br/><br/>The Universe is believed to consist primarily of dark matter, some unknown substance that makes its presence known only by its gravitational effects. Among these effects is the deflection of starlight, also known as gravitational lensing: objects seen behind a dark matter concentration will have their appearance distorted as the light rays pass the dark matter. In some cases this lensing distortion is dramatic, but our view of nearly every galaxy in the Universe is distorted to a very small degree by intervening dark matter. By measuring these weak gravitational lensing effects, one can map the distribution of the dark matter. The distortion typically amounts to a <1% elongation of a background galaxy, so exploitation of weak gravitational lensing requires the astronomer to measure 100,000 to 10,000,000 galaxy shapes, and to pay careful attention to slight optical defects that can mimic gravitational lensing. The rewards are great, however, since the ability to ""see"" dark matter can answer many of the most important questions about the Universe. The work under this grant will apply new techniques to the analysis of weak lensing data, and advance the precision of these measurements to the few-percent level using data being gathered by the Deep Lens Survey and other large imaging surveys. With these data it will be possible to plot the evolution of dark matter halos around galaxies since redshift 0.5.

The VERITAS-4 Observatory consists of an array of four 12 meter diameter Atmospheric Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), optical reflectors which observe faint flashes of Cherenkov light emitted as VHE gamma rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere. Over the past 15 years, the number of confirmed VHE emitters has grown from a single object (the Crab Nebula) to tens of objects; recent observations in the Southern Hemisphere by the next generation HESS Observatory (with sensitivity similar to VERITAS) have more than tripled the number of known sources, and have discovered new classes of sources, including emission from the Galactic Center Sag A*, emission from supernova remnants, emission from X-ray binaries, and emission from Active Galactic Nuclei at the largest redshift ever observed at these energies.

It is currently far from obvious which is the best proxy for the cosmological evolution of the UHECR sources since we are not certain what the sources are. The PI will thus attempt to combine the information from different ultra high and very high energy experiments, including (hopefully) the future detection of very high energy neutrinos, and reach conclusions related to cosmological evolution. The PI proposes theoretical work and data analysis that will lead to a better understanding of the cosmological evolution of different types of powerful extragalactic sources and to identification of the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR) - the highest energy nuclei in the Universe. Special attention will be paid to the cosmological evolution of different types of possible sources. The resolution of this evolution dominates the production of secondary fluxes of cosmogenic gamma rays and neutrinos from ultra high energy cosmic rays interactions in the universal photon fields. These include the microwave background and the extragalactic background light (EBL) in infrared, optical and UV ranges. EBL plays important role in the production of the cosmogenic fluxes and in the absorption of TeV gamma rays - both cosmogenic ones as well as of those coming from different extragalactic sources. The comparison of the absorption of the gamma rays coming from different sources may reveal the cosmological evolution of EBL that is now being disputed.<br/>The results of the proposed work will yield information about a much wider range of global astrophysical and cosmological parameters which underscores the broader impact of this work.

2.243529,"This renewal project is for the completion of the first comprehensive view of the distribution and kinematics of the Milky Way's ionized gas regions in the local universe using the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM), a remotely controlled Fabry-Perot astronomical facility. WHAM collects high-resolution optical emission-line spectra from faint, diffuse sources, and its focused design is sensitive to detect emission nearly a 100 million times fainter than the Orion Nebula. With the instrument's new location on Cerro Tololo in Chile, the investigators can target regions to determine the distribution and physical properties of diffuse ionized gas over the southern sky of the Milky Way. <br/>The investigators completed the first systematic spectral survey of the Milky Way in the Balmer-alpha (H-alpha) emission line of hydrogen. This all sky survey provides a sensitive view of ionized gas, and found a mix of bright, discrete H II regions intertwined with large filaments, bubbles, and shells and revealed a faint, pervasive background detected over the whole sky known as the warm ionized medium (WIM).<br/>WHAM's new view includes one of the brightest, extended regions of emission above star-forming regions in the inner Galaxy as well as one of the largest diffuse H II regions in our sky. Spectra are used to study the distribution of ionization and temperature of the gas within locally ionized regions and across large regions of the Milky Way. The velocity of emitting regions and the relationship of ionized gas to nearby hot stars and neutral gas in large-scale structures can be influenced by past and present generation of relatively short-lived massive stars. The study of complex regions provides insights to energy transport processes in the Galactic disk and halo and traces active star formation in the Galactic spiral arms, which is challenging to map accurately.<br/>WHAM's kinematic resolution and multi-wavelength capability can isolate specific large-scale emission features, which will provide a better understanding how these features depend on environment, metallicity, and local star formation rate. This study will complete several comprehensive, multiline studies of large-scale emission in the Galaxy. The strengths of optical emission from nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and helium relative to that of hydrogen depend on the composition, temperature, heating, and ionization of the gas. The derived properties of the warm ionized medium (WIM) in the inner Galaxy will be compared to those in the outer Galaxy. <br/>Another goal is to study the ionized component of the extended gaseous structures such as the Magellanic Stream, Bridge, and Leading Arm of the Magellanic System, where elemental abundances, dust content, and radiation fields differ significantly from those in our Galaxy. This helps to understand how such ionized regions can be maintained so far from active star formation and whether the ionized component contains a significant amount of mass that not yet been detected.<br/>The WHAM project provides excellent opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate and interact with a research-grade astronomical observatory. It contributes to technological advances in remote observing techniques to improve the quality and efficiency of data collection. The high-quality datasets will be of use by the entire astronomical community. The observations provide essential direction for new, large-scale MHD simulations of a multiphase interstellar medium where ISM matter and energy are transferred to and from stars. WHAM contributes to the fields of aeronomy, solar system astronomy, extragalactic astronomy, and cosmology. Its deep sensitivity and velocity resolution enable studies of the Earth's atmosphere, comets, and zodiacal dust. The full characterization of the faint but pervasive ionized gas in the Galaxy needs to be understood for the analysis of extragalactic and cosmic backgrounds."

0.149323,"This award funds the activities of Professor Matthew Reece at Harvard University.<br/><br/>The Standard Model of particle physics was developed nearly forty years ago and explains the vast majority of experimental data at distances as small as one one-thousandth the size of a proton. Nonetheless, it leaves behind many mysteries. Why is the gravitational force between two fundamental particles vastly weaker than the other forces? What is the dark matter that is far more prevalent in our universe than normal matter, but transparent to light and so far detected only through its gravitational effects? This research aims to provide theoretical support to the diverse experimental programs that are probing these and other questions. It will propose new strategies for analyzing data and extracting signals from the huge backgrounds present at the Large Hadron Collider experiments. This research will also build new models that will highlight discovery opportunities that current experimental searches may be missing. It will also study the implications of new experimental results for important paradigms like naturalness, which have shaped theoretical physics but still require a confrontation with experiment. The broader impact of this proposal will be include serving as a resource for local high school physics teachers and helping to communicate recent discoveries in physics to young students. By working with the existing, successful outreach program Physics Theorynet, which has built connections with Boston-area high schools, the PI will visit local high schools to answer student questions, explain the interplay between theory and experiment that goes into developments like the Higgs discoveries, and help students understand the career options available to them in science.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award will proceed in several interconnected directions. It will assess the status of scenarios for natural supersymmetric theories, including the class of models called Stealth Supersymmetry developed by the PI. This will be done through simulation of the predictions of these models for existing LHC searches and through planning of how new, focused searches could better test these models. It will also assess the status of cosmology and dark matter in fine-tuned supersymmetric models, and develop a better understanding of how R-parity violation could evade overproduction of dark matter in scenarios with low-scale reheating temperatures. The research will help to ensure that the LHC experiments do not overlook possible long-lived particles, which could reveal the existence of new, higher scales to motivate future experiments. It will also study the connection between possible indirect detection signals of dark matter from space and hidden-sector physics that can be probed in high-precision terrestrial experiments. The PI will also study aspects of quantum field theory underlying all of these topics. By working on a broad research program, the PI will provide theoretical tools to maximize the impact of our very exciting, data-rich era."
0.749801,"The goal of this research project is to devise novel methodologies and<br/>devices for problems in computational science and engineering that<br/>require high-intensity of arithmetic operations (also known as<br/>Floating-point Operations Per Second, or ``FLOPS''). Among the many<br/>hurdles faced in research and development of such compute-intensive<br/>technologies is achieving energy-efficient utilization of the<br/>available computing resources. Similar to the miles/gallon metric used<br/>in automotive design, one is interested in a metric that can be used<br/>in the design of new computing technologies: optimizing<br/>FLOPS/watt. This research will be on designing novel algorithms and<br/>architectures that optimize this metric. These algorithms and<br/>architectures will be customized to a particular class of scientific<br/>computing problems: tree-based finite element methods and N-body<br/>problems.<br/><br/>It is possible to devise algorithms that parallelize well and are <br/>energy efficient (i.e., produce high ``percentage-of-peak''<br/>measurements). Often, however, such algorithms sacrifice work<br/>optimality. It is much more difficult to design algorithms that do so<br/>while achieving both work optimality and energy efficiency.

0.32,"Research in Fundamental Nuclear and Particle Physics is being categorized in three areas: At the ""Energy Frontier"", physicists hope to discover new physics, e.g. new symmetries or particles, by colliding particles with increasingly high energy. At the ""Cosmic Frontier"", physicists use the cosmos as a laboratory that contains detectable information about new physics. And finally, at the ""Precision Frontier"", physicists attempt to measure quantities that are believed to be known very precisely, and to interpret deviations from the known physics predictions as a signal for new physics. This award supports a measurement of the third type, a precision measurement of several observables in free neutron beta decay which serve to better understand the fundamental interactions between elementary particles. The process of beta decay has been incorporated into the standard model of elementary particle physics, which gives us a successful description of elementary particle processes. A discovery of new physics would have a critical impact on Nuclear and High Energy Physics, and on Cosmology. Being on the forefront of scientific research and on the edge of what is technologically feasible, the project will serve as a training ground for future generations of scientists. Most of the research will be done by students at the undergraduate and graduate level. <br/><br/>This grant supports the effort to design, construct, commission, and operate the Nab spectrometer. The spectrometer will use the state of the art neutron beamline (FNPB) at the new Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge, TN to determine the two-dimensional energy distribution of decay electron and protons in neutron beta decay. The redundancy inherent in the standard model description of the neutron beta decay process allows uniquely sensitive checks of the model's validity and limits, with strong implications in astrophysics. One of the expected observables, the determination of the neutrino-electron-correlation coefficient with a relative uncertainty of 0.1%, will allow an extraction of Vud, the upper left element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, in order to test its unitarity. The current NSAC long range plan finds that ""The only realistic way to improve Vud is via neutron decay."" New results from high energy physics cast a shadow on the unitarity of the CKM matrix, and re-open the possibility of finding hints for new exchange bosons, or a fourth quark generation. The other observable, the determination of the Fierz term, which parametrizes a deviation from the known shape of the spectrum of the decay electrons, to about 0.001, allows finding new particles that mediate scalar or tensor interactions at low energy, in a complementary way and with sensitivity competitive to what is expected from LHC."

Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, engaging in research projects that incorporate women in physics and summer students from high schools, and workshop talks for high school teachers and general public talks on cosmology. <br/><br/>The work will addresses systematic errors that arise from a variety of intrinsic alignments in weak lensing studies.

0.178261,"This project will study the millimeter/sub-millimeter optical properties of cosmic analog dusts at low temperatures. A dry cryocooler will be purchased so that work on this project can continue, free from the expenses of perishable cryogens. In addition, a Fourier Transform Spectrometer, designed specifically for this work, will be constructed in PI's research lab. Once these apparati are in place, the mm/sub-mm opacity and emissivity of many dust samples, made internally or obtained from external groups will be measured, using an innovative program of study. The main goals of this work are to (A) utilize the rich set of tools and expertise developed within the observational cosmology community to measure the above properties to unprecedented accuracy, (B) analyze dust species produced by different methods and different investigators under the same experimental conditions in order to clearly understand common trends and basic difference between the samples, and (C) implement an efficient experimental scheme for analyzing a large number of dust candidates, which would naturally lead to the creation of a database on the measured properties.<br/><br/>At visible wavelengths, dust obscures many interesting astronomical environments such as molecular clouds, star forming regions, young and old stars enveloped by dust, and young ultra-luminous galaxies in the early universe. The mm/sub-mm spectral region is a good regime to study these objects because dust is more transparent at these wavelengths. Information on the nature of interstellar dust is useful in and of itself because dust is an important component in galactic and stellar evolution as well as in the complex chemistry present in space that ultimately gives rise to prebiotic molecules, and this information can reveal more about the nature the objects/environments that are obscured by dust. Recent laboratory studies have shown that the properties of dust in the mm/sub-mm spectral region is more complicated than previously thought. Therefore, detailed studies dust species that can serve as analogs for cosmic dust such as those that will be undertaken in this project are needed before astronomical data on such environments can be interpreted with any confidence. This need has been intensified recently due to the availability high-quality mm/sub-mm data from new observatories such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array."
0.18,"Nonlocal dispersive wave equations have been recently applied in many areas such as electromagnetism, acoustics, cosmology, elasticity, biology, hydrodynamics, viscoelasticity, seismics, water wave, plasma, quantum mechanics, brain and consciousness, and so on. However, their nonlocality introduces considerable challenges in both mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. This project seeks to address fundamental issues related to mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of nonlocal dispersive wave equations as well as their solution properties. The proposed project will bridge the gap between different areas, enhance interdisciplinary research, and advance the application of fractional differential equations in practice. Since nonlocal wave equations have broad applications in physics, chemistry, biology and engineering, the research in this project has great potentials to advance the research and technology in relevant areas.<br/><br/>The main objectives of this research are to build mathematical and numerical treatments for the nonlocal Schroedinger wave equations, and to provide a deeper understanding of the modeling with long-range interactions, so as to advance their application to problems with nonlocality. In this project, both the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger (DNLS) equation with long-range interactions and the fractional nonlinear Schroedinger (fNLS) equation with the fractional Laplacian will be investigated. Integrating the discrete and continuous models offers a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of the nonlocality of the Schroedinger wave equations. On the one hand, accurate algorithms will be developed to improve the efficiency and reduce the computational costs in simulating the DNLS with large lattice sites, especially in two- or three-dimensional lattices. On the other hand, efficient and accurate numerical methods for discretizing the fractional Laplacian will be designed and applied to study the properties of the stationary states and dynamics of fNLS. The study on the DNLS and fNLS will provide a deeper understanding on modeling and properties of long-range interactions, as well as is benefitting the development of numerical algorithms for fractional differential equations."
5.0,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond a dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award will provide support for the design and fabrication of a next-generation (G2) experiment, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, which will operate at the deepest large clean underground laboratory in the world. The high background rejection and control of contamination that the SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies. The baseline design for this new experiment will deploy an initial 50 kg payload of germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) detectors. Some of these detectors will be operated in a manner that provides very low energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to the lowest dark matter particle masses (< 0.5 GeV) and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. It will provide a strong possibility of the discovery of particle dark matter and detailed information on its properties.<br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies. SuperCDMS scientists will continue their involvement in public outreach, collaboration with K-12 teachers, and support for Berkeley physics majors who are training to teach science and for promising high school students from underserved backgrounds."
0.336468,"The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the leading unsolved problems in cosmology today, and absent any direct detection of the particles themselves, the structure of nearby dwarf galaxies remains one of the most promising avenues for learning about the temperature and self-interaction properties of DM because any deviations from the standard cold dark matter model should happen at low masses.<br/><br/>Modern ideas regarding how galaxies form in the Universe involve some form of ""hierarchical"" process by which small systems progressively merged into ever larger systems like our Milky Way Galaxy. A key element of this paradigm regards how mergers proceed, which, in turn, relies on understanding the nature of the DM needed to drive the formation of galaxies within the observed lifetime of the Universe. Dwarf galaxies are the smallest, simplest entities with DM that also contain visible baryonic material in the form of stars and/or gas. As such, they---and particularly their dark halos---represent our best local analogs of the building blocks that initiated the hierarchical process. The broad goal of this project is to use empirical techniques---primarily kinematic observations of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies---to determine key properties of DM halos in these systems in a largely model-independent way.<br/><br/>The specific aims of this project include (1) learning how DM is distributed within individual galaxies by measuring the central mass densities and core properties of DM halos, (2) exploring how the evolution of the baryonic matter may have altered the DM components in galaxies, (3) determining if DM halos are truly scale free, (4) mapping the extents of DM halos in dwarfs and understanding how their dark and visible components have merged into the greater halo of our Galaxy, and (5) laying the groundwork to reconstruct the properties of the primordial population of dwarfs that contributed to the assembly of our Galaxy. This project builds on decades of NSF-sponsored instrument building and research grants to aid our understanding of the nature of DM.<br/><br/>The investigators will engage in educational activities with several K-12 teachers, give public talks, and participate in events such as ""Ask an Astronomer."" The project will also support graduate student training throughout the grant period."
0.139556,"A Globular Cluster is a tight group of hundreds of thousands of stars bound together by gravity. There are hundreds of Globular Clusters orbiting around our own Milky Way galaxy. Globular Clusters serve as fossils that trace conditions in the universe at the earliest times, when galaxies were just starting to form. Intriguing differences are observed between individual Globular Clusters, which provide clues about the formation of our Galaxy. In Globular Cluster stars, the concentrations of atoms belonging to different chemical elements vary in ways that challenge conventional wisdom about the ages, origins and life cycles of stars. The investigators will make observations with some of the world?s largest and best-equipped telescopes to test theoretical models of how stars, star clusters and galaxies come to be.<br/><br/>The principal work involves (a) developing a unified scenario for self-enrichment among star clusters; (b) understanding the stellar content of Globular Clusters through novel dynamical and stellar population investigations; and (c) studying the relationship between Globular Clusters and galaxies at the extreme upper limit of the Globular Cluster mass function. New optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations will be made to explore how measurable quantities (such as mass-to-light ratios and abundance anomalies) depend on age, metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and dynamical evolution. Intriguing trends, many of which confound standard interpretations, have already been identified: 1) self-enrichment appears to be implicated in abundance spreads in Galactic Globular Clusters and in a mass-metallicity relation found in extragalactic Globular Cluster systems; 2) observed properties of galaxy stellar halos, and initial measurements of gas in intermediate-age clusters, each challenge the favored mechanism for self-enrichment; 3) the dependence of mass-to-light ratio on metallicity is opposite to that expected from stellar evolution models; 4) an expanding zoo of compact stellar systems has been identified, including ultra compact dwarfs, that could be formed either by tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies or from Globular Cluster mergers; 5) the elevated mass-to-light ratios of ultra compact dwarfs may be explained by massive central black holes. The investigators will clarify each of these issues, test stellar evolution and population synthesis models, and trace the origins of compact stellar systems.<br/><br/>Since Globular Clusters are more complex than formerly realized, understanding their properties and how they relate to other types of stellar systems has wide implications in astrophysics; inferences drawn from Globular Clusters inform theories of the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies, black holes, and dark matter. This fundamental work impacts forefront research from star formation to cosmology. <br/><br/>To promote the broader impacts of this research effectively, the partnership with the non-profit organization, ?Science Buddies?, will be continued. This highly successful pilot program has already engaged thousands of K-12 students from diverse backgrounds, including disadvantaged groups. A vigorous program of professional and public outreach will continue, with a proven record of including women, undergraduates, and minorities in forefront research. A successful pilot program to involve undergraduates in Massive Clusters research will be expanded. Students and post-docs will receive excellent training with access to world-class facilities and to senior researchers, participating in all aspects of the research process. A user-friendly, legacy catalog of newly discovered compact stellar systems and their fundamental properties will be publicly available online."
0.135,"This proposal funds the research activities of Assistant Professor Jack Laiho at Syracuse University. Laiho's research focuses on precision studies of the interactions of quarks via the strong and weak nuclear forces. These forces are a part of the enormously successful Standard Model of particle physics. In order to compare the predictions of the Standard Model with experimental observations large-scale supercomputer calculations are required to correctly account for the effects of the strong nuclear force using an approach called Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Theoretical predictions of the Standard Model are compared with experimental results obtained from particle accelerator experiments, thus testing our understanding of the laws of nature. So far, good agreement has been found. While it is satisfying that the current framework describes matter and its interactions so well, it is known from cosmology that there is physics not accounted for within the Standard Model. The discovery of discrepancies between the Standard Model predictions and experiments done at particle colliders would be very exciting, as such results could lead to an understanding of the mysteries that are not explained in the current framework, including why there is as much matter in the universe as there is. A broader impact of this research is that the Lattice QCD ensembles used by the PIs are made publicly available and are used by other researchers studying quark interactions throughout the world. Additionally, knowledge of computational methods and problem solving skills needed to perform research in lattice field theory are useful assets for graduate students, whether they continue in academic research positions or get jobs in the private sector.<br/><br/>Laiho's research focuses on calculations using Lattice QCD that are needed to maximize the impact of high-energy particle physics experiments. This includes lattice calculations of heavy-light and light-light weak matrix elements, quantities where one needs to control the effects of non-perturbative QCD. This work makes use of high performance computing facilities throughout the US, and is used for calculations of Standard Model predictions that are needed for comparisons with experimental observations as part of the search for new physics. Laiho also has an interest in applying lattice methods to the study of quantum gravity to try to determine whether or not a quantum field theory of gravity is renormalizable when formulated nonperturbatively. The Lattice QCD calculations funded by this grant are essential to make best use of the existing and planned experimental facilities including LHCb and Belle II. They can help to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model, and they provide insight into the workings of the strong nuclear force and quark interactions. The research on gravity might lead to an understanding of how to handle another nontrivial theory using lattice methods in the non-perturbative regime."
1.181707,"This project involves the study of nuclear reactions utilizing beams of short-lived radioactive nuclei, together with the development of instrumentation and techniques to facilitate these investigations. Specific experiments will emphasize the study of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability. Several of these weakly bound systems have been shown to develop an exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, leading to an effective nuclear size that is much larger than expected based on the properties of more normal systems. Our interest is in the effect that this structure has on nuclear reactions induced by ""halo"" nuclei."" The development of deuterated-scintillator neutron detectors for this project may have applications to national-security programs. In addition, we plan to use specific nuclear reactions to probe the structure of nuclei that are important for the understanding of neutrinoless double beta decay. Several massive and expensive experiments are underway to search for this exotic decay mode, which would represent physics beyond the so-called standard model of particle interactions. If observed, this decay mode would also present a means to directly measure the mass of the neutrino, which is important for subjects such as high-energy physics, astronomy, and cosmology. However, this application requires much-improved knowledge of the structure of the nuclei involved in the beta-decay process. The experiments we are planning to carry out will contribute to the development of this understanding.<br/><br/>In addition to the already-mentioned contributions of instrumentation development to national-security issues, the broader impact of this project extends to the development of a scientifically-literate workforce via the involvement of students at the graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels in world-class scientific research. These groups are afforded opportunities for hands-on training in nuclear accelerators, superconducting ion-optical systems, radiation detection, and other technologies. The undergraduate students come from Notre Dame and the University of Michigan, and also from several primarily-undergraduate universities and colleges in the Midwest. The high-school program includes public lectures and other outreach activities designed to highlight nuclear science and its applications to other fields such as archaeology and medicine. Finally, the program has an international component involving close collaborations with physicists in Mexico and Brazil, and new collaborations including the UK, France, and Italy are proposed."
0.015,"The long-term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimental students learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theory students can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The research is primarily focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding improving the trapping of antihydrogen, and on the design of a third generation trap optimized for gravitational research. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at Berkeley and at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, Vlasov codes and 3D Particle-In-Cell codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. This research is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering."
0.438,"****Technical Abstract****<br/>This CAREER grant supported by the Division Materials Research aims to have a crystal growth of new and perfect topological insulators/superconductors and exploration of Dirac surface state of the perfectly grown topological insulators (TIs). It also aims to integrate research in experimental condensed matter physics and development of a unique physics educational program at Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T). New methods will be used to grow perfect bulk insulating TIs and to fabricate large surface-to-volume ratio of TI nanowire arrays. These perfect topological materials are necessary for Dirac surface current detection which is important for both new physics exploration such as studies of Majorana fermion and axion electrodynamics, and technological applications such as spintronic and quantum computing devices. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, Aharonov-Bohm effect and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak interference on the perfectly grown TIs will be performed to estimate surface Dirac electron effective mass and decay length. Surface resistivity measurements under magnetic fields up to 45 T will then be carried out for the investigation of fractional quantum Hall effect which is a big quest in the field concerning the role of interactions and strong correlations in topological states of matter. <br/><br/>****Non-Technical Abstract****<br/>Topological insulator (TI) is a new quantum material which has insulating property in its bulk but has high conductivity of electrons on its surface. This surface conducting state is predicted to be a solution for future computing technology. However, surface transport measurements are challenging due to the imperfections of the current existing TIs. A new synthesis technique that utilizes a reduced confining reaction space will be applied to grow perfect bulk insulating crystals in order to permit surface current detection. This electronic transport detection of the surface electrons or the surface Dirac state is necessary for heat dissipation-less spintronic devices where electron spin manipulation can be performed by interfacing a perfect TI and a superconductor for potential fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. Besides, TIs can act as a bridge to bring together high energy and condensed matter physicists to search for long-sought particle such as the Majorana fermion i.e. a fermion which is its own anti-particle and an intermediate particle for electric and magnetic field interactions called the axion which could provide a clue to the mystery of dark matter in cosmology. This CAREER grant also helps to integrate the material synthesis in solid state physics course taught in S&T and to present physics shows targeted to local K-12 students."

0.344262,"Exploding stars that show no Hydrogen in their spectra are called Type 1 supernovovae. They are vital for many areas of astrophysics. The most famous sub-class are the Type Ia, which have yielded exciting results about the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, for the next step in precision cosmology, identifications are needed of Type Ia at very large distances, which is difficult, because they are easily confused with other types of Type I supernovae, namely Type Ib/c. This survey will study the observed differences between these supernova types to eliminate mistaken classifications and thus enable a better understanding of the acceleration of our universe at earlier stages in its expansion, billions of years in the past. <br/><br/>While Type Ia are the result of thermonuclear explosions of a C-O white dwarf in a binary system, Type Ib/c are core-collapse explosions from massive stars, which have been removed of their outermost H layer. Type Ib/c observations cannot be used to derive accurate distance measurements; however, because their spectra look like Type 1a supernovae, they can contaminate large supernova surveys. This award is to conduct a thorough statistical analysis of optical spectra and lightcurves (records of light emitted over time) of thousands of supernovae in order to distinguish between Type Ia supernova and Types 1b and 1c and remove the impostors from the surveys. This project will develop the tools needed to quickly and automatically identify and remove Type 1b/c supernovae from surveys. The PI will provide these tools and methods to the community for future observations with other telescopes, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which is expected to yield thousands of new supernova candidates per night. The data will also be used to test models of core-collapse explosions of massive stars, which will improve knowledge of stellar evolution. The PI will train and mentor a graduate student and undergraduate student in research, and she will also collaborate with an external organization to recruit a promising high school student from an underrepresented group in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). <br/><br/>The work will be done through a two-pronged approach: 1) utilizing the traditional spectral template approach with well-established algorithms, and then 2) employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive eigenspectrum bases, which if found in a robust fashion, can be easily used to construct average spectral time-series templates and to identify any new classification schemes within the available data. In addition, the PI will clarify the link between SN spectral classification for SN Ib/c, including those connected with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and their purported stellar progenitors by testing for hidden He in SN Ic. This will be done by comparing observed spectra and light curves of a large set of SN Ib/c, for the first time, with those predicted from two competing models. The PI will use spectra and lightcurves of over 5800 supernova explosions that are recently published (such as WISeREP and SUSPECT) or are in-hand."
0.832109,"High-energy cosmic rays are important cosmic messengers that are producing new insights about extreme processes in the universe. The Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory has measured millions of cosmic rays. Some of the most interesting are protons or atomic nuclei, whose arrival directions are correlated with the large-scale distribution of matter within 250 million light years of the Earth and thereby reveal which astrophysical objects are capable of producing these extremely high energy particles. A primary advantage of the Auger Observatory in studying cosmic rays is its complementary ground detector array, which detects the cascade of particles produced in the atmosphere by the parent cosmic ray, and ultraviolet telescopes, which image the pattern of nitrogen fluorescence generated by the passage of the particle cascade through the atmosphere. Combining these two techniques provides the best possible measurements of these rarest of particles. <br/><br/>The Auger group at Pennsylvania State University has been involved with the Auger project since 1992. With this award they will continue their work to resolve the issues involved in utilizing the two detection techniques and exploit the Auger measurements to deduce properties of particle interactions at energies far beyond the reach of laboratory studies on Earth.<br/><br/>The Pennsylvania State University group will continue their established series of popular week-long summer workshops for high school teachers that are based around new results in cosmology and high-energy astrophysics.

0.12,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. LZ is a ~7-tonne liquid xenon (LXe) dark matter detector to be installed at the 4850-foot level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, to look for dark matter. This work will contribute to the design of that detector. Development of technology related to LXe will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble liquids as detection materials. These projects will also result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. LXe has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>This detector will use established liquid xenon time projection chamber technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-D position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid xenon, removal of surface artifacts, and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The design also features a gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator veto that will hermetically enclose the central xenon detector and provide powerful tagging of background neutrons and gammas. The LZ experiment will have world-leading sensitivity to WIMP dark matter with a sensitivity about 400 times better than current results and covering a substantial range of theoretically motivated candidates. This award will provide funding to enable this research group to continue to contribute to the LZ dark matter experiment with work on the cathode high voltage delivery system."
0.39,"NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Liquid crystals are unquestionably one of the most commercially important forms of condensed matter. They are widely used in displays, electro-optic and photonic devices and for energy conversion. This usefulness arises from the ability to control the orientation of these cigar shaped molecules with electric and magnetic fields. New materials allow ever more complex structures to be engineered and increase the functionality of liquid crystalline materials. The Principal Investigator (PI) and his team will develop new types of liquid crystals consisting of tiny colloidal particles dispersed in a liquid crystal medium. The colloidal particles will have different shapes (topologies) which will determine the types of structures that the liquid crystals will develop when subjected to electric and magnetic fields. They will study the behavior of these 'topological colloids' to learn how the interactions between the nanoparticles and the liquid crystal molecules determine the structure with the goal of developing a ""recipe book"" to organize the particles into precisely controlled structures. Understanding of fundamental underpinnings of this 'topology-guided' self-assembly may enable development of new electrically- and optically-controlled materials with unique properties needed for practical devices of importance to society, such as flexible displays and data storage devices. The PI will integrate this research with a broad range of synergistic educational and outreach activities, including 'Light, Color, & Matter' Wizard Shows in elementary and secondary schools, Science Tours for high school students, advising student chapters of professional societies and providing research experiences for students and faculty from minority-serving institutions.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>The PI seeks to develop a new soft matter system dubbed 'topological colloids' and identify the fundamental organizing principles behind topology-dictated self-assembly of colloidal particles in liquid crystals (LCs). This research will involve the design of methods for scalable fabrication of topologically distinct colloidal particles of different sizes and their dispersions in LCs, experimental study and modeling of the interplay between the topology of particles, director fields, and topological defects, as well as explorations of switchable colloidal self-assembly and alignment controlled by electric and magnetic fields and light. The emerging interdisciplinary scientific frontiers are at the nexus of nanoscience, condensed matter physics, and topology/mathematics. From subatomic particles to cosmology, many phenomena arise from the topological interaction of fields, surfaces, and monopole or string-like defects. This topological interplay is constrained by theorems from topology but is hard to be probed experimentally. The model system of topological colloids may enable direct experimental studies of such topological interactions, thus impinging on many scientific fields, well beyond the specific goals of the proposed research activity. The research activity is transformative in nature and expected to lay the groundwork for new research directions ranging from topology-constrained self-assembly to experimental studies of low-dimensional topology. Beyond the exploration of physical underpinnings, the experimental arena PI and his students are developing may enable scaffolding of nanoparticles, self-assembly of reconfigurable topological memory devices, as well as new electro-optic effects based on switching between different multi-stable director fields and orientations of particles. The fundamental phenomena will be examined in contexts of self-assembly-based fabrication of novel nanostructured composites and may lead to practical LC devices of importance to society, such as novel displays. The research is integrated with a broad range of synergistic outreach and educational activities ranging from Wizard Shows in elementary and secondary schools to teaching short courses for liquid crystal industry and to organizing international conferences and summer schools."

1.0,"The PIs plan to investigate QCD, electroweak symmetry breaking, and physics beyond the Standard Model. The grant period coincides with the first experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which will probe QCD processes to unprecedented precision and discriminate among proposed models of electroweak symmetry breaking. One strand of the PIs' research in theoretical particle physics addresses the origins of mass. They study the causes of electroweak symmetry breaking (responsible for the masses of the W and Z particles that transmit the weak nuclear force) and the mechanisms responsible for the diverse masses of the quarks and leptons, the elementary constituents of matter. While the Standard Model of particle physics can accommodate massive particles, it does so by invoking a particle (the Higgs particle) that has not yet been observed and it does not explain the dynamics through which mass arises. Hence, the PIs seek to advance the understanding of the origins of mass by using field theory, model building, and computer simulation to explore physics that lies outside the Standard Model. Of particular interest are ""Higgs-less"" models whose only new particles are massive vector bosons, heavier analogs of the W and Z . They plan to construct new models of this kind that can provide insight into the masses of the quarks and leptons, analyze the experimental consequences of such models, and propose incisive new tests based on LHC data. <br/>Another strand of the PIs' research stresses topics, such as QCD and the properties of the Higgs boson, that are both intrinsically interesting within the Standard Model and also necessary precursors for many studies of physics beyond the Standard Model. The PIs engage in detailed QCD calculations necessary to compute the production rate and detection backgrounds for a standard model Higgs boson; they provide software to experimentalists to allow for the proper evaluation of experimental results. <br/><br/>This project includes multiple efforts in the areas of linking research to education, diversifying participation, and broad dissemination of research results. The PIs will keep presenting pedagogical lectures at international summer schools for doctoral students and collaborating with Master's Degree and undergraduate Honors students on research and outreach projects. These efforts introduce students to new areas of knowledge and provide them with faculty mentoring. The PIs will continue to create, employ, assess, and disseminate particle physics and cosmology outreach materials for K-12 students and teachers. Several of their annual outreach events focus on female students or those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Simmons will also sustain her efforts to improve the climate for women physicists at the college, university, and national levels."
0.02,"This award supports participation by US-based researchers in two workshops that are parts of a Thematic Semester on the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. The Thematic Semester will be held at the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques (CRM) in Montreal, Canada. The term ""AdS/CFT correspondence"" refers to a remarkable connection between two major directions in modern theoretical physics, string theory and Yang-Mills theory. The study of this correspondence is intimately related to some of the most fundamental questions in contemporary theoretical physics, such as the formation of black holes and early-universe cosmology. The topic also has applications to quantum chromodynamics and condensed matter physics. The objective of this project is to support the participation of junior US researchers in two workshops organized within this thematic semester: ""Positive Grassmannians: Applications to integrable systems and super Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes,"" held July 27 - 31, 2015, and ""Module spaces, integrable systems, and topological recursion,"" held January 9 - 13, 2016. <br/><br/>The planned semester at the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques will represent the state of the art in the studies of the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. A special focus will be those aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence that allow for exact solutions, such as the appearance of integrability in the planar limit of super-Yang-Mills theory, lower dimensional models, higher-spin theories, as well as topological field and topological string theories. The semester will be a unique forum that brings researchers with expertise in the AdS/CFT correspondence together with experts in integrability.

The primary objective is to determine the total number, specific frequency, spatial distribution, and color distribution of each galaxy's GC system. The data will be used to establish how these properties vary with galaxy morphology and environment, to test models of how galaxies form and evolve, and to constrain fundamental quantities like the redshift at which the first GCs formed in the Universe. The survey data will also be used for two other science applications: (1) follow-up spectroscopy to measure the radial velocities of the GCs and use them to trace the structure of the galaxies and their dark matter halos; and (2) combining the optical images from the survey with X-ray data to study the X-ray sources - including X-ray emitting black holes - in giant galaxies. <br/><br/>This project includes significant components of service to the community, public outreach, and education. In preparation for the survey, Dr. Rhode is leading an effort to produce a well-integrated system for transfer, analysis, visualization and storage of ""One Degree Imager"" (ODI) camera data. The goal is to make it possible for anyone in the astronomical community to analyze ODI data without having to purchase and maintain expensive hardware or write specialized software to work with these large images. The solutions created for the ODI will pave the way for other Gigapixel camera projects and will benefit other disciplines that use large images to do research. Dr. Rhode's team will create high-quality color images of each galaxy with accompanying text and use these to inform educators and the public about galaxies in general and the specific research that is enabled by these types of images. Finally, the survey will allow graduate and under-graduate students to engage in research aimed at exploring some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics and cosmology, using data from a new instrument. The students will be encouraged to participate in both the research and outreach activities of the project."
0.217294,"The global theory of minimal surfaces in space is in a phase of<br/>explosive growth. Many new methods of constructing complete<br/>embedded minimal surfaces have recently been found; in place of a<br/>dearth of examples just a few years ago, we now have a quite<br/>varied collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A<br/>basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them<br/>into families with common properties and understood<br/>limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that<br/>combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of<br/>geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,<br/>notably Teichmuller theory.

At the same<br/>time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal<br/>surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass<br/>representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully<br/>documented, and useful as a research tool.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to<br/>biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;<br/>indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their<br/>foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some<br/>or several of its features in the expression we witness. At its<br/>base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we<br/>search for principles in science that can be formulated as<br/>extremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of<br/>optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation. This<br/>leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions<br/>of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.)

0.183618,"This project examines various aspects of the topology of manifolds: their classification, their bundles, and their symmetries. The project will focus on six areas. The first is to give a systematic approach to topological equivariant rigidity, using tools from surgery theory, algebraic K-and L-theory, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture. The second is to study characteristics classes of matroid bundles (defined by Anderson and Davis) and to apply them to combinatorial incidence geometry. The third area is to investigate a rigidity conjecture involving self-homotopy equivalences of 3-manifolds and its connections with high-dimensional topology. The fourth area is to give the the classification, up to homeomorphism, of manifolds having the homotopy type of the total space of certain torus bundles over lens spaces. This is an application of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture. The fifth area is to compute the L-groups of a free product of groups, and thereby solve the connected sum problem - when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum. The last area is to study the algebraic and point-set topology of actions of p-groups on the torus from the point of view of homotopical group actions and Smith theory.<br/><br/>Geometric topology is the study of manifolds. An n-dimensional manifold is a set of points locally modeled on n-dimensional Euclidean space. For instance, a 2-manifold is a surface and looks like a plane near each point.

This project has several different aspects. One is to solve the connected sum problem -- when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum? Another is to provide a strengthening of the Farrell- Jones Conjecture in L-theory, similar to that achieved by Davis-Khan- Ranicki in K-theory. Yet another is to classify involutions on a torus, using the computation of the L-theory of the infinite dihedral group and the proof of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in L-theory for crystallographic groups, joint with Connolly.

A sample of up to 10 clusters, selected to span the relevant parameter space in age and metallicity, will allow the investigation of : a) mechanisms for Li depletion in main-sequence stars, b) tests of theoretical explanations for the behavior of Lithium abundance with temperature, and c) the galactic evolution of Lithium and its relation to 'primordial' Li abundance. The research plan focuses on using the behavior of Lithium abundance in unevolved stars as probes of stellar structure and evolution, but the results would have implications for the determination of globular cluster ages, big bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmology."
0.748564,"This award is to support development and test the accelerated, efficient reconstruction and beam-forming algorithms for radio astronomical detectors. When possible, computations will be ported out to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) clusters that provide massively parallel floating-point capabilities. This approach is ideally suited to the data generated by digital radio astronomy arrays, and especially well suited when the respective hardware is deployment at remote observation sites - because of the proposed algorithms show excellent performance-to-power efficiency when compared to general-purpose supercomputers. Additionally, the real-time (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) FPGA-based algorithms will be developed for radio transient data reduction. They will help developing accelerated radio simulation methods to support and validate the proposed methodology. These algorithms and methodology will be tested at the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), an array of in-ice antennae deployed in the U.S. Antarctic South Pole Station to detect highest-energy neutrinos coming from the deep Universe sources. The award's broader impacts are in the use of high-performance parallel computing and efficient real-time data reduction in the fields of radio astronomy, cosmology, and particle astrophysics. Expansion of the use of GPUs will provide the necessary computing power for next-generation experiments in a sustainable, efficient way. The post-doctoral researcher and graduate student will be part of the overall development and testing. In addition, undergraduate students will also be involved in the research. An on-line public research component will be developed to engage ""citizen scientists"" in the analysis of radio astronomy data on home computers."
0.702,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests in particle physics is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Extensions of the standard model predict not only new particles with masses above the electroweak scale (about 100 billion electron-volts, eV), but also so-called WISPs (Weakly Interacting Sub-eV Particles). The most famous WISP candidate is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in Quantum ChromoDynamics and which turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. Similarly, axion-like particles, light spin 1 particles called ""hidden sector photons,"" seem to occur naturally in realistic embeddings of the standard model into string theory. It is therefore an important and fundamental question whether any of these weakly-interacting light particles exists. <br/><br/>The Any Light Particle Search (ALPS) experiment will give students and postdoctoral scientists the opportunity to develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines spanning lasers and optics, electronics and feedback control systems, vacuum and cryogenics, computational methods and data analysis algorithm development. The required technologies are spin-offs of technologies that were developed for ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The work supported by this award will build on these investments and continue the development of techniques and devices which have commercial applications in the laser and optics industries.<br/><br/>The ALPS experiment is a ""shining light through a wall"" study. In such an experiment, laser light traveling through a strong magnetic field may (in part) be converted to axions or axion-like particles. These particles are so weakly interacting that they can pass unimpeded through an opaque wall and then convert (in part) back to photons in a second ""regeneration"" region of a strong magnetic field where they are detected. The most sensitive laboratory setup thus far is the first stage of ALPS I concluded in 2010. With major upgrades in magnetic length, laser power and the detection system, the proposed ALPS II experiment aims at improving the sensitivity by a few orders of magnitude for the different WISPs. This award will enable US participation in the ALPS experiment by bringing the group's expertise in seismic isolation and suspension systems."

0.065064,"Dark matter, which accounts for about 85% of all mass, is the dominant driver of structure formation in the Universe, but the nature of dark matter currently is unknown. Galaxies, containing visible, baryonic matter in stars and gas, are embedded in vast dark matter halos. (""Baryonic matter"" in the Universe primarily consists of protons and neutrons, and the chemical elements based on those particles.) Galaxies, therefore, can be used as visible probes of dark matter's role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in the Universe, a fundamental problem in modern cosmology. This project aims to improve our understanding of galaxy assembly and the relationship between dark and baryonic matter. The researchers will expand and improve simulations and statistical tools used to understand the connection between galaxies and their dark matter halos. They will study the influence of environment and cosmic time on the properties of galaxies in dark matter halos. They will create realistic mock galaxy catalogs that will be essential for a better interpretation of upcoming large galaxy surveys. The project will support the mentoring and active involvement of both graduate and undergraduate students in the research program. The PI will also expand a partnership with the planetarium at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, providing a unique opportunity for undergraduate interns and enriching the public understanding of the science from galaxy surveys.<br/><br/>Halo occupation modeling is a powerful theoretical tool to interpret galaxy clustering measurements and constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter.

This project will extend the modeling approach to include cosmic evolution and environmental dependence, two crucial aspects that are currently missing. First, the evolution of the halo occupation models will be studied using semi-analytic galaxy formation models. The dependence of these models on the large-scale environment of the galaxies will be explored using both semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations. These two studies will then be combined to examine the evolution of the environment trends and the environment dependence of the evolution.

Unfortunately, many examples of scientific computations have led to incorrect results, sometimes with catastrophic consequences. Currently known validation techniques cover only a fraction of the possible corruptions that numerical simulation and data analytics applications may suffer during execution.

Assessing validity in the presence of potential data corruptions is a serious and insufficiently recognized problem. Corruption may occur at all levels of computing, from the hardware to the application. An important aspect of these corruptions is that until they are discovered, all executions are at risk of being corrupted silently. In some documented cases, months have elapsed between the discovery of a corruption and notification to users. In the meantime, a potentially large number of executions may be corrupted, and incorrect conclusions may result. It may be difficult, after the fact, to check whether executions have actually been corrupted or not, so that even if corruptions do not lead to mistakes, they may lead to significant productivity losses. Virtually all simulations producing very large results need to reduce their data volume in some way before saving it --one technique is called lossy compression. <br/>This project strives to validate the end result of the simulation coupled with lossy compression.

0.1541,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, left over from the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the Galaxy, yielding a sidereal modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. <br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) dark matter experiment is a leader in the field of directional dark matter detection, with sensitivity to the powerful angular signature of nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The collaboration will be testing their next prototype detector, DRIFT-IIe, above ground at Occidental College. It features an inherently scalable design including a redesigned field cage, a texturized, thin-film cathode, a new, transparent wire readout which doubles the fiducial volume per readout, and a new every-wire data acquisition system which allows for lower noise and fiducialization in the detector plane. <br/><br/>The potential of DRIFT's capabilities have promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience."
0.18,"This project will investigate how atoms can be used to test our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature, i.e. our understanding of elementary particles and their interactions. While one can search for new particles directly with large collider facilities, it is also possible to test the effects that new particles could have on processes occurring in atoms and molecules. Such experiments require very high precision and a very good understanding of the systems that are being studied. Moreover, certain atoms and molecules might be much better suited to the studies of fundamental interactions owing to their having properties that enhance desired effects. This project will investigate which systems are the best for future studies of this kind. The experimental work in this field also requires theoretical analysis of the experiments, and this work will provide such analysis and will develop methods to improve the accuracy further. This research is at the interface of atomic physics with high-energy physics, nuclear physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology.

This research uses semiclassical techniques to study the first order quantum effects of loop gravity and to clarify the structure of the theory so that these effects can become solid predictions characterizing the quantum nature of gravitation. The work proceeds along three main lines: At the Planck scale, a quantum behavior of the geometry of space is expected. Loop gravity provides a specific realization of this expectation and predicts a granularity of space with each grain having a quantum behavior. The first line of this work investigates the geometrical character of the spin network basis, the basis that captures this discreteness. In particular, a manner for investigating the volume of more complex grains of space, beyond the tetrahedral case usually studied, is being pursued.<br/><br/>There is a well known one parameter ambiguity in the loop quantization of gravity, which is coded in the Immirzi parameter. In the second line a new method for investigating the origin of the Immirzi parameter is being investigated. Clarification of the role of this parameter is essential for the theory to make definite predictions. Finally, in the third line, a novel method for the calculation of the perturbative graviton propagator is being investigated. This method uses the tools of semiclassical mechanics and could substantially streamline the calculation of propagators and n-point functions in the theory. Successful development of this method will also allow the calculation of the first order quantum corrections in the theory.<br/><br/>Completing this research program will establish loop gravity as a strong candidate for the description of gravity at the Planck scale; a description that not only provides a quantum picture of spacetime at microscopic scales and is compatible with our current understanding of quantum field theory but one that can predict signatures that will be experimentally tested as they enter the domain of technological feasibility. Experimental astrophysics and cosmology are achieving unprecedented measurements of the large-scale universe. This project aims to predict new quantum gravitational phenomena so that we can witness science at its best: prediction and experimental measurement arriving together."

0.207736,"This award supports a project of Professor Shokurov. The proposed research deals with complements of log pairs with different levels of singularities, including ones which naturally appear in the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP). Complements have important applications in modern birational geometry but rooted in the classical question about singularities of a linear system on algebraic variety, in particular, of a plurianticanonical linear system. The main conjecture of the project about boundedness of complements implies almost directly two other fundamental conjectures in the field: the ascending chain condition (acc) conjecture for minimal log discrepancies (mld's) and that of for thresholds of singularities. The acc for mld's and for thresholds are intimately related to log termination in the LMMP, completion of the LMMP, and birational rigidity. On the other hand, complements can be applied to the Alexeev and Borisov brothers conjecture on Fano varieties. For this, a renewed key tool is log adjunction, namely, conjectural effectiveness and positivity of log adjunction. The PI intended to develop further these methods. They may have also other fundamental generalizations and implications in Diophantine and algebraic geometry, e.g., toward a more precise form of conjectural Kodaira additivity.<br/><br/>This is a research in the field of algebra and geometry with methods and applications in birational geometry. The morphisms of such geometry are rational transformations, e.g., flips, and are typically far away from classical continuous or differentiable transformations of a space. Rational transformations fits to model disconnected catastrophic changes of a space. Algebraic geometry treats rational transformations in terms rational functions with prescribed zeros and poles, or in geometrical terminology, in terms of linear systems of divisors on algebraic varieties. Thus many problems about these transformations can be translated into problems about singularities of those linear systems. Birational geometry is an old and traditional area of mathematics which get a revolutionary flowering in the past decades. The area interacts with most of branches of mathematics, e.g., analysis, topology and mathematical physics, with applications in those fields as well as in number theory, cosmology, discrete and computational mathematics, robotics."
0.225,"Acceleration of computing power of supercomputers along with development and deployment of large instruments such as telescopes, colliders, sensors and devices raises one fundamental question. ""Can the time to insight and knowledge discovery be reduced at the same exponential rate?"" The answer currently is clearly ""NO"", because a critical step that combines analytics, mining and discovering knowledge from the massive datasets has lagged far behind advances in software, simulation and generation of data. Analysis of data requires ""data-driven"" computing and analytics. This entails scalable software for data reduction, approximations, analysis, statistics, and bottom-up discovery. Scalable and parallel analytics software for processing large amount of data is required in order to make a significant leap forward in scientific discoveries. <br/>This project develops innovative, scalable, and sustainable data analytics algorithms to enable analysis and mining of massive data on high-performance parallel computers, which include (1) bottom-up and unsupervised data clustering algorithms that are suitable for spatio-temporal data, massive graph analytics, community computations, and detection of patterns in time-varying graphs, different types of data, and different data characteristics; (2) change detection and anomaly detection in spatio-temporal data; and (3) tracking moving data and cluster dynamics within certain time and space constraints.

0.208,"An aperture array is a group of antennas that can be deployed in particular geometric patterns to detect radio signals at a given range of frequencies. Using an array is beneficial for electrical engineering because it can magnify a radio signal in the direction of that signal while suppressing noise and interference through a process known as beamforming. In addition, an antenna array can be used to detect the direction and distance of the signal's source. Aperture arrays are a crucial component of scientific instruments that measure the spatial distribution of radio sources. For example, radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) instrument, rely on aperture arrays to generate precise radio images of electromagnetic sources for experimental cosmology and space science. These instruments image the sky using closely spaced radio beams known as radio pixels. Closely packed sets of such beams can be achieved by using hexagonal pixel grids, which are considered ideal for scientific studies. In order to build aperture beamformers to be used for a specific purpose, efficient schemes for processing the antenna array signals must be developed to reduce the computing time, energy consumption, and costs for the hardware required in the system. The proposed research creates new algorithms and digital computing architectures that will produce highly-focused hexagonal radio pixels for the most demanding of microwave imaging applications. The same aperture arrays are used in radar and wireless communication systems for signature detection and signal intelligence. In fact, aperture arrays are absolutely essential for national security and public safety from a threat detection perspective. In addition to its scientific merits and benefits for national security, this project will train highly qualified personnel (HQP), who will contribute to commercial industry, scientific research, public safety agencies, and the defense sector. Specific efforts will focus on promoting Women in Engineering programs in higher education to recruit and guide female engineering students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. <br/><br/>The proposed research tackles the problem of highly directional sparse aperture arrays using the mathematical properties of multi-dimensional recursive digital filters. The NSF-sponsored effort will develop hardware systems for aperture arrays based on the proposed concept of network-resonant phased-arrays (NRPAs). Multi-dimensional (MD) circuit theory and digital hardware form an enabling technology for imaging algorithms that can greatly improve performance over traditional technologies. This research proposes groundbreaking techniques based on array signal processing, circuits and systems. It will result in a significant improvement in the directional sensitivity while using a lower number of array elements compared to traditional phased array receivers of the same sensitivity. The proposed NRPAs combine the concept of network resonance with phased array technology to gain significant improvement in both directionality and sensitivity. The MD circuit theoretical concept of network resonance allows digital beamformers to have complex pole manifolds. These properties are shown to have advantages in terms of ultra-wideband frequency response, exceptional directionality, multi-beams with shape control, rapid steerability, and low computational complexity. This project investigates radio beams with a hexagonal sky-print for optimal sensing and microwave imaging over wide fields-of-view and bandwidths. The proposed NRPAs will be extended to both sparse and random arrays via theoretical formulations for decreasing hardware cost, reducing energy expended in computers and increasing design flexibility."

These methods and applications interact with most of branches of mathematics, including differential geometry, topology, number theory, and algebra, and can be useful in mathematical physics, cosmology, cryptography, and robotics. From its origin geometry is closely related to volume. The main objects under investigation are differential forms of volume type on families and their products. The project addresses problems on polynomial finite generatedness of those forms and on estimation of degrees of generators with respect to the dimension and possibly to some other discrete invariants of members of families. New techniques are needed in dealing with differential forms on families or relative differential forms. Another novelty of the project is to develop theory of the finite generatedness based on universal mappings from moduli theory instead of traditionally used vanishing of cohomologies.<br/><br/>The project deals with fundamental problems on linear systems of divisors associated to twisted differential forms on fibered spaces. Standard problems about linear systems are problems about their base points, about singularities of their general or special members, and about correspondences with or isomorphisms to other systems. Respectively, the PI considers the semiampleness problem for moduli part of weakly log canonical families, the construction of log canonical complements for fibered varieties with applications to log canonical local and global thresholds, to a new beta invariant and to Tian's alpha invariant, and explores possibility of an isomorphism between log canonical linear systems adjoint to the discriminant curve for different conic bundles structures of a threefold with applications to birational classification of those conic bundles. Strictly fibered cases for log canonical complements and for Sarkisov's links do not cover all possible cases, they cover main cases and remaining ones are exceptional. The latter form usually bounded families up to birational isomorphisms. A new technique relevant to these problems will be developed under the project. This makes use of relative toroidal log singularities, theory of b-polarizations, theory of moduli of triples, interlaced by flops, and correspondences of those moduli. Investigation of moduli of varieties defined up to flops is natural and agrees with the spirit of current birational geometry where the minimal models are defined up to flops."

0.231734,"The proposed research deals with problems which connect moduli of log pairs with birational geometry of algebraic varieties. They are related to a higher dimensional log generalizations of Kodaira's formula for the canonical bundle of an elliptic surface and have crucial applications to the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP), and in particular, to the subadditivity of Kodaira dimension. The LMMP gives a uniform structure of many moduli spaces of polarized algebraic varieties and of their natural compactifications. The PI intends to develop further such general relations and to apply this to 3-dimensional birational geometry. In addition, for 3-folds, he proposes a search for new birational invariants with good deformation properties of smooth families.It is expected that the dimension 3 is maximal for which the nonrationality is a smooth deformation invariant. However, one of the main conjectures in the project is about boundedness of exceptional log pairs and varieties for higher dimensions, that is, for any fixed dimension they form a coarse moduli of finite type. The problem is one of the main obstacles in the dimensional induction for the LMMP and in some closely related problems such as termination of flips, the ascending chain condition for minimal discrepancies and thresholds, boundedness of complements and in Alexeev's and Borisovs' conjecture.<br/><br/>This is a research in the field of algebra and geometry with methods and applications in birational geometry, an old and tradirional area of mathematics. In the past decades it was revolutionary changed that had led to spectacular achievements in higher dimensional geometry. One of the major new contribution to geometry is a systematic use of so called log pairs, pairs consisting of a geometrical object with its subobject of codimension 1, e.g., a subobject given by zeros of a function or by a hyperplane section. Moduli or families of such pairs are interwoven into modern geometry. The most fundamental questions about moduli are related to their boundedness, that is, to a presentation of certain moduli spaces in terms of finitely many parameters. Moduli theory interacts with most of branches of mathematics, e.g., differential geometry, topology, algebra and number theory, with applications in these fields as well as in mathematical physics, cosmology and robotics."

Measuring galaxy distances is fundamental to many investigations in Cosmology, such as Dark Energy studies. Knowledge of the redshifts of spectroscopically measured galaxies can be propagated to photometric objects using information extracted from spatial clustering. Dr. Menard will improve and generalize this idea to the point of being able to apply it to existing and future datasets, such as those to be gathered by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the work include training of a postdoctoral researcher, sharing algorithms with the community, development of a graduate course on modern statistical analysis, and lecturing to Baltimore area high school students on distances in astronomy."

It provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the principal investigators, the Blue Waters project team and vendor technical team.<br/><br/>The current standard model for Type Ia supernovae is the explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar mass. Despite 50 years of study and a good qualitative understanding of the relevant physics, a quantitative model for these explosions that the community can agree upon is lacking. On Blue Waters, the problem will be solved using three new, highly scalable codes. White dwarf ignition will be followed using the low Mach number code, MAESTRO; turbulent nuclear burning will be simulated using the compressible AMR code, CASTRO; and radiation transport will be followed using the 3D implicit Monte Carlo code, SEDONA. All three codes have been proven to scale on at least tens of thousands of processors.<br/><br/>Major resources, both computational and observational, are being invested by the US and Europe in attempts to discover and understand Type Ia supernovae. Part of the reason is their application to the dark energy problem in cosmology. These supernovae are also a laboratory for studying combustion in a situation where long time scales and large length scales allow phenomena to develop that are not terrestrially observable. Each of the three codes being developed to study supernovae has potential application outside of astrophysics, e.g., in combustion science and inertial fusion. The project will also help to train the next generation of computational physicists."
0.299933,"In many scientific and engineering applications, it is necessary to solve an inverse problem; that is, to determine quantities defining an object or a system through indirect measurements. The mathematics used to produce images in devices such as X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are excellent examples. The mathematical models describing an inverse problem are often so complicated that it is not possible to find an exact analytical solution, and it is necessary to use an approximation based on a set of simpler equations. However, many equations may be needed; in medical imaging, for example, it is not unusual to compute approximations by solving millions of equations. Additional complications arise because an inverse problem may have infinitely many solutions, or the solutions may change dramatically if there are small errors in the indirect measurements. Thus, additional constraints and mathematical tools (often referred to as regularization) are needed to stabilize the numerical methods. The type and amount of regularization is problem dependent, requiring the algorithms to be able to easily adapt to user and/or problem specifications. The aim of this project is to develop mathematical tools and algorithms that exploit particular mathematical structures (called Kronecker product and tensors) in the matrices associated with equations that make up the inverse problem. Exploiting these structures will allow for better approximations, more efficient algorithms, and better facilitate the incorporation of regularization methods. One targeted application is for inverse problems that arise in image reconstruction for breast cancer detection; advancements in this area would have a clear benefit to society.<br/><br/>Efficient singular value decomposition (SVD) approximation methods for large-scale matrices that arise in discrete ill-posed inverse problems will be developed. The approach will exploit inherent Kronecker product and tensor structures, and will be the basis for a computational platform for the efficient solution of large-scale ill-posed problems. Efficient approaches to solve Kronecker product and tensor structured SVD updating problems will be developed. Iterative methods that can incorporate regularization, sparse and low-rank constraints on the solution will also be considered. The SVD approximations and updating methods developed in this project can be used as tools to obtain approximate solutions of ill-posed inverse problems, as preconditioners to accelerate iterative solvers, or as tools to build solution methods for nonlinear problems. The computational platform, based on SVD approximations, developed will have a broad scientific impact for applications where it is necessary to compute solutions of large-scale ill-posed inverse problems, including astronomy, cosmology, geophysics, microscopy, and medical imaging."

In addition to testing General Relativity, the discovery of gravitational waves will make possible new tests of theories that explain the origin of the acceleration of the universe's expansion and that reconcile quantum mechanics with gravity, two of the most profound challenges facing fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers (PFC) award the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) will focus on the detection and characterization of gravitational waves with nanohertz frequencies-frequencies eleven orders of magnitude lower than those probed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). NANOGrav will use observations of millisecond pulsars (pulsating neutron stars spinning with a period on the order of a millisecond) to search for these low frequency waves. The arrival times of the emissions from these pulsars will stray from their regular pattern if distorted by the passage of a gravitational wave. Correlating observations between different pulsars and monitoring pulse arrival times will enable NANOGrav to search for these low frequency gravitational waves in a way different from but complementary to LIGO. NANOGrav will also engage middle school and undergraduate students in their research efforts, including data collection, analysis, and characterization, as well as the search for gravitational waves in the data. The Center will have a targeted approach to increase student participation of women and traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The NANOGrav Physics Frontier Center will monitor the pulse arrival times of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in order to detect and characterize low frequency gravitational waves (GWs). In addition to known MSPs, the Center will search for new ones.

0.33576,"Recurrent novae are compact binaries where Roche lobe overflow is spilling material onto a white dwarf, where the matter accumulates until it is hot enough to start a thermonuclear runaway that creates a nova eruption at least once per century. The recurrence time is so fast due to the white dwarf being near the Chandrasekhar mass and due to a high accretion rate. If recurrent novae have massive white dwarves with material being piled onto them at a fast rate, then they must inevitably collapse when the mass accumulates to the Chandrasekhar limit and then produce a Type Ia supernova. With this logic, recurrent novae are a leading contender as being the progenitor system for Type Ia SNe. Various other types of systems have been proposed as progenitors and this has resulted in a still-unresolved 'Type Ia progenitor problem' that has been prominent for over 40 years. This problem is now critical to large enterprises of broad importance since Type Ia events are being used as standard candles for cosmology to determine the age and fate of the Universe. The solution of the progenitor problem is required to calculate the evolution with red shift of the supernovae peak brightnesses. <br/><br/>Here, Dr. Schaefer, along with undergraduates and a high school student, will attempt to answer the fundamental question ""Are recurrent novae the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae?"" by performing two significant tests. The first is whether or not the white dwarfs in such systems are gaining or losing mass. To answer this, the mass ejected during eruption will be measured for two recurrent novae by timing their orbital period changes across recent eruptions. The rate of accretion for these stars will be derived from UBVRIJHK photometry and light curve modeling. An exhaustive search of archive plates dating back to 1889 will determine the rates of eruption. Thus it will be possible to assess the mass accumulated between eruptions to compare with the mass lost. The second question is whether there are enough recurrent novae in our Galaxy and the Local Group to allow for the observed Type Ia events. This will be accomplished through various tests of the discovery frequency, which will result in a realistic estimate of the total number of recurrent novae in our Galaxy, the LMC, and in M31. The novae lifetimes will be derived using their measured accretion rates and the death rate will be the total number divided by the lifetime. This can then be directly compared with the Type Ia event rate.<br/><br/>As part of this project, Dr. Schaefer will continue his active public outreach work. This program will also involve undergraduate students and a high school student in front-edge research as well as make up the bulk of a Ph.D. dissertation for a graduate student at Louisiana State University."

Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology.

Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimental students learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theory students can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The research is primarily focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding improving the trapping of antihydrogen, and on the design of a third generation trap optimized for gravitational research. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at Berkeley and at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, Vlasov codes and 3D Particle-In-Cell codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics.

The LMC observations will aid in understanding how local variations in star-formation history are distributed. This, in turn, will help us to understand star-formation in intermediate redshift galaxies.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental goals of modern astrophysics is to understand how galaxies have evolved. A galaxy's evolution can be determined by measuring the chemical compositions and ages of its stars. In this project, Professor Smecker-Hane and collaborators will accomplish two goals. First, they will calibrate the depth of calcium absorption lines in the near-infrared spectra of stars as a function of age and chemical composition. They will extend the current calibration to younger and more metal-rich stars so the calcium lines can be used to investigate other galaxies which have stars with ages from 2 to 15 billion years and chemical compositions from one to one-thousandth of the Sun. Second, these investigators will use this new calibration to determine the chemical composition of stars as a function of radius in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using Cerro Tololo InterAmerican 4 meter Telescope in Chile. The LMC is a gas-rich, intermediate-mass galaxy with a distance of only 160,000 light years, which makes it one of the Milky Way's nearest neighbors. They will combine the chemical compositions with data from the Hubble Space Telescope in order to accurately measure the LMC's star-formation history. Existing data hints that the LMC experienced a significant burst of star formation approximately 3 to 5 billion years ago, and understanding the details of the burst -- its strength, duration, and cause - can give us valuable clues about the nature of star bursts frequently seen in faint blue galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

However, at the low end of the galaxy luminosity function, the agreement between the CDM theory and observations is somewhat at odds. In particular, the existence of bulgeless, cored small galaxies is not a natural prediction of CDM. However, these are the scales where the baryonic physics of gas cooling, star formation and feedback can significantly impact the overall mass of the galaxy. Furthermore, accurately modeling the star formation process requires spatial resolution of order 100 parsecs or less and mass resolutions of less than 10000 solar masses in order to resolve the molecular star forming regions of the interstellar medium. The planned simulations will use the Blue Waters petascale system to model space telescope survey volumes consistent with addresssing small galaxies from high redshift to the present with sufficient resolution to make robust predictions of the luminosity function, star formation rate and morphologies appropriate for these surveys.<br/><br/>Students will be involved in these computational advances in cosmology research.

0.0336,"9505136 Ontaneda A basic problem in Geometry and Topology is to study the relation between curvature (local information about a space) and topology (global information about a space). The investigator studies a particular case of curvature: spaces of non-positive curvature, in the riemannian case and in the PL (piecewise linear) case. He also studies some problems concerning riemannian and PL rigidity (in the non-positively curved case); the relation between riemannian and PL non-positively curved geometry; and how the topology could determine the curvature: which spaces admit a non-positively curved geometry. A space with non-positively curved geometry is a space on which, essentially, an object, as it moves away from an observer, seems to decrease in size at a rate equal to or faster than the rate in the ""real world"" (euclidean geometry). In general, geometry determines some properties about the (global) shape of the space. For instance, if a space has a non-positively curved geometry, after ""unwrapping"" the space we obtain another space that, unlike a doughnut, can be shrunk within itself to a single point (Cartan-Hadamard theorem). This research project is oriented towards studying such relations on spaces with non-positive geometry: how the geometry (local data) determines the global shape (topology) and also how topology could determine the geometry. Although the relevance of this to the ""real world"" is not obvious if one considers only the apparently Euclidean environs of the earth, questions of cosmology -- the nature of the universe as a whole and not merely our small corner of it -- are intimately related to these mathematical questions. ***"
0.093424,"This award will address important questions regarding the mathematical foundations of physical theories: solutions to the Euler equations in Fluid Dynamics; the Cauchy problem for relativistic dissipative fluids; the Penrose inequality in General Relativity; and effective potentials in String Theory. It also addresses the issue of compactness of solutions to the Yamabe problem on manifolds with non-umbilic boundary. Understanding the convergence of solutions of the free boundary Euler equations to solutions of the standard Euler equations in a fixed domain will provide mathematical justification to several approximating schemes used in the Applied Sciences. It may also give useful hints on how to improve such schemes. There have been important developments in Astrophysics and Cosmology which deal with relativistic viscous fluids. It is therefore paramount to give a proper mathematical treatment of the Cauchy problem describing these situations. The Penrose inequality is a longstanding open problem in the physics of gravitation. Proving it in different situations is an important step towards establishing the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, which in turn can be viewed as a test for the consistency of General Relativity. Effective potentials are among the most promising approaches to construct realistic models in String Theory. Finally, the study of compactness of solutions to the Yamabe problem on manifolds with non-umbilic boundary is an important extension of the results known so far. All these problems are extensions of previous work done by the PI and collaborators. <br/>Broader impact: All problems described in this project will certainly lead to new interactions between Physics and Mathematics, as well as the development of new techniques which will undoubtedly have applications to other problems in Physics, Analysis and Geometry. The techniques developed to study the Cauchy problem in relativistic dissipative fluids will likely be applicable to other problems in the field of Partial Differential Equations. The proof of compactness of solutions to the Yamabe problem for manifolds with non-umbilic boundary will require an analogue of the Weyl Vanishing Theorem for the umbilicity tensor. A recent proof of the charged Penrose inequality given by the PI and M. A. Khuri relies on the introduction of a new quasi-local mass tailored to electrically charged initial data sets. Its generalization can potentially bring new insights to the broader issue of mass in General Relativity. The last decades have seen an extremely fruitful exchange between Geometry and String Theory, and the study of effective potentials is certain to provide new avenues for this interaction. The ideas of this project will also reach an audience outside the PI immediate field of expertise through their dissemination via topics courses, seminars etc. Finally, one hopes that some of the outcomes of this project will eventually help the task of building an ever more scientifically educated society. In the age of the Large Hadron Collider, where popular books and TV shows present the general public with concepts like black holes, giant stars and extra dimensions, keeping track of the mathematical and logical solidity of our physical theories can help citizens to decide what to take as well-established science versus ideas which have yet to meet the standards of academic rigor."
0.180318,"String theory, as a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, encompasses both quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of general relativity. A remaining challenge is the identification of the appropriate set of background conditions relevant to the formation of our universe. Compactifying the eleven-dimensional M-theory/supergravity can lead to a very large number of four dimensional vacua. It is therefore necessary to understand the extra, compact dimensions and discover the links between the properties of these spaces and the physics we observe in our universe. <br/><br/>This research addresses two important aspects of string compactifications. A primary focus is the determination of how, in the context of global flux compactifications, string vacua exhibiting Standard Model like spectra exist. This study will also apply constraints from cosmology, such as the cosmic microwave background, to put restrictions on the inflationary type potentials obtained from string theory. In addition, questions regarding the details of the geometry, such as mirror symmetry, will be addressed. A second approach will be made in studying various features of AdS4/CFT3 aimed at improving our understanding of the four dimensional string landscape, as well as three dimensional condensed matter systems. The projects , taken together, are very timely since, during the course of the next few years, data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be improving our understanding of physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, more accurate observations of the cosmic microwave background using the European Space Agency PLANCK satellite will provide even tighter constraints on the possible inflationary scenarios arising in string theory. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Results from the proposed work will be of interest to several sectors of the mathematics and physics communities. Furthermore the proposed activities will foster collaborations and intellectual exchange within the UNH physics and mathematics community and amongst regional, national and international collaborating scientists.

As such, they---and particularly their dark halos---represent our best local analogs of the building blocks that initiated the hierarchical process. The broad goal of this project is to use empirical techniques---primarily kinematic observations of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies---to determine key properties of DM halos in these systems in a largely model-independent way.<br/><br/>The specific aims of this project include (1) learning how DM is distributed within individual galaxies by measuring the central mass densities and core properties of DM halos, (2) exploring how the evolution of the baryonic matter may have altered the DM components in galaxies, (3) determining if DM halos are truly scale free, (4) mapping the extents of DM halos in dwarfs and understanding how their dark and visible components have merged into the greater halo of our Galaxy, and (5) laying the groundwork to reconstruct the properties of the primordial population of dwarfs that contributed to the assembly of our Galaxy. This project builds on decades of NSF-sponsored instrument building and research grants to aid our understanding of the nature of DM.<br/><br/>The investigators will engage in educational activities with several K-12 teachers, give public talks, and participate in events such as ""Ask an Astronomer."" The project will also support graduate student training throughout the grant period."
0.090965,"A Globular Cluster is a tight group of hundreds of thousands of stars bound together by gravity. There are hundreds of Globular Clusters orbiting around our own Milky Way galaxy. Globular Clusters serve as fossils that trace conditions in the universe at the earliest times, when galaxies were just starting to form. Intriguing differences are observed between individual Globular Clusters, which provide clues about the formation of our Galaxy. In Globular Cluster stars, the concentrations of atoms belonging to different chemical elements vary in ways that challenge conventional wisdom about the ages, origins and life cycles of stars. The investigators will make observations with some of the world's largest and best-equipped telescopes to test theoretical models of how stars, star clusters and galaxies come to be.<br/><br/>The principal work involves (a) developing a unified scenario for self-enrichment among star clusters; (b) understanding the stellar content of Globular Clusters through novel dynamical and stellar population investigations; and (c) studying the relationship between Globular Clusters and galaxies at the extreme upper limit of the Globular Cluster mass function. New optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations will be made to explore how measurable quantities (such as mass-to-light ratios and abundance anomalies) depend on age, metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and dynamical evolution. Intriguing trends, many of which confound standard interpretations, have already been identified: 1) self-enrichment appears to be implicated in abundance spreads in Galactic Globular Clusters and in a mass-metallicity relation found in extragalactic Globular Cluster systems; 2) observed properties of galaxy stellar halos, and initial measurements of gas in intermediate-age clusters, each challenge the favored mechanism for self-enrichment; 3) the dependence of mass-to-light ratio on metallicity is opposite to that expected from stellar evolution models; 4) an expanding zoo of compact stellar systems has been identified, including ultra compact dwarfs, that could be formed either by tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies or from Globular Cluster mergers; 5) the elevated mass-to-light ratios of ultra compact dwarfs may be explained by massive central black holes. The investigators will clarify each of these issues, test stellar evolution and population synthesis models, and trace the origins of compact stellar systems.<br/><br/>Since Globular Clusters are more complex than formerly realized, understanding their properties and how they relate to other types of stellar systems has wide implications in astrophysics; inferences drawn from Globular Clusters inform theories of the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies, black holes, and dark matter. This fundamental work impacts forefront research from star formation to cosmology. <br/><br/>To promote the broader impacts of this research effectively, the partnership with the non-profit organization, ""Science Buddies"", will be continued. This highly successful pilot program has already engaged thousands of K-12 students from diverse backgrounds, including disadvantaged groups. A vigorous program of professional and public outreach will continue, with a proven record of including women, undergraduates, and minorities in forefront research. A successful pilot program to involve undergraduates in Massive Clusters research will be expanded. Students and post-docs will receive excellent training with access to world-class facilities and to senior researchers, participating in all aspects of the research process. A user-friendly, legacy catalog of newly discovered compact stellar systems and their fundamental properties will be publicly available online."
0.015,"Last year, antihydrogen was trapped for the first time by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN. By this point hundreds of antiatoms have been trapped for times as long as 1000 s. While this was a remarkable achievement, the ALPHA apparatus is not well configured for most measurements of the properties of antihydrogen, and must be rebuilt to allow laser and better microwave access. Furthermore, the trapping rates, while sufficient to begin studies of the properties of antimatter, are lower than optimal. There are two broad challenges to improving the trapping rate: (1) Understanding the behavior of the positron and antiproton plasmas from which the antihydrogen is synthesized; and (2) Understanding the atomic processes by which positrons and antiprotons recombine. Antihydrogen synthesis lies on the boundary between atomic and plasma physics, and cannot be studied properly without employing tools from both fields. The long term goal of antihydrogen research is to search for differences between the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences might occur between the spectra of the two species. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. Another place differences might occur is in the gravitational interactions of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences could solve the baryogenesis problem. A third area of potential difference is in the fractional charge of antihydrogen. The net charge of antihydrogen is only known to about 10^-7 relative to the unit charge. Positive results from any of these measurements would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. <br/><br/>The long-¬term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-¬antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. The trapping of antihydrogen last year was extraordinarily widely noted in the lay and scientific press. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The proposed research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups."
0.6,"With the progress of science, the previously distinct disciplines of nuclear physics, elementary particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology are becoming ever more closely intertwined. This award, while nominally categorized under nuclear theory because of its focus on the structure and dynamics of subnuclear particles, also contains strong elements of particle theory, atomic physics, and even string theory. In order to reflect not only the wide interests of the PI and co-PI, but also to provide their Ph.D. students a wide range of exciting research opportunities, the project covers five distinct areas of study in which rapid progress is attainable. The award also provides some support for short-term visitors (collaborators and seminar speakers), whose expertise will stimulate further advances in the project areas, and travel funds for all personnel to present their findings at seminars and conferences and to learn about new advances in physics. The broader significance of this project is thus incorporated in (i) interdisciplinary research that crosses boundaries between fields, (ii) the training of junior researchers in the methods and findings these disciplines, and (iii) cross-institutional exchanges to maximize the effectiveness of all involved researchers' skills.<br/><br/>The five topics are:<br/><br/>(1) Baryons, such as protons and neutrons, can be studied by allowing the number of charges (Nc) of the strong nuclear force to vary. The ""1/Nc expansion"" is based on the idea that the structure and dynamics of baryons are easier to understand if Nc is considered a large number (it is 3 in our universe). But recent work shows that the expansion is not unique. The PI will compare the predictions of different 1/Nc expansions using experimental data to determine which, if any, is preferred.<br/><br/>(2) Generalized parton distributions are the most fundamental observable quantities for describing the structure of strongly-interacting particles such as protons. The upgrade at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia makes it possible to measure them with unprecedented accuracy, so the calculation of corrections to the older ""low-order"" results by the co-PI will be essential to our determination of whether one really understand what is going on inside a proton.<br/><br/>(3) Protons are sensitive not only to the strong nuclear force, but the weak force as well through the process of ""electroweak deep inelastic scattering"" (EW DIS), and these effects will appear not only in data at Jefferson Lab, but also subsequent facilities. The co-PI will calculate corrections to the lowest-order results, which will allow one to understand how multiparticle states are correlated at long distance and to separate known from as-yet-unknown physics.<br/><br/>(4) Both the PI and co-PI will study the origin of how different species of neutrinos, extremely light and electrically neutral particles, can transform into each other. They will employ both conventional symmetry approaches within the context of quantum field theory and string-theoretical approaches based upon the idea that particles arise from structures called ""D-branes"" that live in extra dimensions of spacetime but intersect with our dimensions.<br/><br/>(5) The PI will build on his recent work describing how to create ""true muonium"" - an atom consisting of a muon (a subatomic particle created, for example, in cosmic rays) and its antiparticle, in immediately realizable experiments. Like all atoms, it appears in a multitude of excited states with a rich spectroscopy, and how to create and characterize these states is interesting not only for its own sake but for precision tests of the electromagnetic forces that bind the true muonium atom."

The Observatory will operate two 8-meter optical/infrared telescopes in a collaboration consisting of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. <br/><br/>The Gemini telescopes are located at sites with excellent observing conditions, one in the northern hemisphere on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and one in the southern hemisphere on Cerro Pachon in Chile. Gemini's scientific mission is focused on fundamental questions, using new technologies and new observational and operational approaches. <br/><br/>Gemini's science community has devised an ambitious plan for the next five years of science exploration. This plan for research and new instrumentation exploits Gemini's unique capabilities to attack many of the outstanding grand challenges in astrophysics and cosmology. These include: how galaxies, stellar, and planetary systems form; the frequency of occurrence of extra-solar planets, including earth-like planets; how super-massive black holes and galaxies are related; determining the nature of dark matter and dark energy; how the cosmic dark age ended; and how stars produce the chemical building blocks of life. <br/><br/>During the next five years of operations, researchers will continue to exploit the current set of powerful instruments addressing these questions as well as others. This work will answer many questions in its own right, as well as provide a bridge to the science to be done with a new suite of instruments under development during this award period. <br/><br/>While primarily focused on scientific exploration, Gemini will produce many broader impacts. Its public information and educational outreach program will continue to disseminate Gemini science discoveries to the world on scales from local to international. It will continue to enhance the educational infrastructure and the development of new generations of scientists and technologists through teacher training and community programs. Gemini's highly diverse international staff and program will continue to stimulate international and intercultural understanding and cooperation."
0.71475,"This proposal requests continuing support for a program of research for the Sokoloff/Meadows group at the University of Cincinnati Main Campus in experimental elementary particle physics based primarily on the BaBar experiment at SLAC and the proposed LSST experiment.<br/><br/>The BABAR Collaboration was created in 2004 to design, construct, and operate a detector at an asymmetric B-factory to study the origins of CP-violation in the decays of B mesons. In addition to many discoveries made related to B meson physics, BABAR has discovered new particles (the DSJ and the Y(4260) as examples) and has discovered new phenomena such as the oscillations (mixing) of particles into anti-particles, and vice versa, in the neutral D meson system. During the coming grant period, the group will pursue it studies of D0 &#8722; D 0-bar mixing, CP-violation in D meson decays, fundamental properties of D mesons, B meson decays related to measuring the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix angle a, and of decays of the Y(4260).<br/><br/>Looking to the future, they have begun working on the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project to study the distribution of dark matter in the universe. Both the characteristics of dark matter and its distribution within the universe provide important constraints on any theory of the fundamental forces of nature. Precise measurements of the distribution of dark matter via weak lensing, made in parallel with direct observations of high mass particles produced at the Tevatron and/or the LHC, direct observations of dark matter in the laboratory, and indirect observations of the interactions or decays of dark matter in astrophysics experiments will lead to a fundamental unification of physics at the smallest and largest scales. Now the Standard Model does not include a candidate for the cold dark matter which is so much more abundant than its baryonic cousin. Their work on BABAR constrains theories of physics beyond the Standard Model and may help point the way to new physics. Studying the distribution of dark matter in the universe will connect the particle interactions one observes in the laboratory today with those observed in the universe at the earliest times.<br/><br/>On Broader Impacts, the group will continue its work primarily within the QuarkNet program as well as employing undergraduates in the research. In research, they will collaborate closely with astronomers on the LSST. While they have very, very much to learn from them, they also offer new perspectives and experience that should lead to better conventional astronomy, as well as first-rate cosmology. They bring experience working in large collaborations, with tremendously large datasets, where reducing and understanding systematic uncertainties is critical to the science. Integrating the techniques of experimental particle physics with those of astronomy promises the greatest reach for answering fundamental scientific questions related to dark matter and dark energy."
0.398061,"Research for Undergraduates Summer Institute of Statistics at The University of Nevada Reno (RUSIS@UNR) is the continuation of a successful (AMS award-winning) summer REU site. The underlying motivation for the Institute is to attract more students into graduate work in the Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, and facilitate their transition into research work at a time when demand for human resources with data analytic skills easily exceeds the supply. The RUSIS@UNR program will prepare students to compete globally in a vibrant world where data-driven decisions are becoming more prominent in all human endeavors. While the program has been successful in motivating and enticing students to pursue graduate careers in the statistical sciences, it also provides the necessary tools for students to join the workforce in a wide range of professional positions. From academic jobs, to jobs in the pharmaceutical companies, private industry, government agencies and national laboratories, professional sports as data analysts, and climate scientists, the job outlook for statisticians and data scientists is excellent. <br/><br/>The RUSIS@UNR objectives will be accomplished through the following mechanisms: (1) Mentoring and research supervision, of 15 selected underrepresented minority undergraduate students and students with no easy access to a career experience at their institution, through an intensive core course in probability and statistics. In addition, topics in stochastic processes, and statistical inference, with special emphasis on areas of current interest will be discussed; (2) Engaging the students in research projects from areas of current interest. Statistical thinking is ubiquitous in every aspect of modern life. Data Mining, Big Data, Data Analytics, Knowledge Discovery are terms that have been coined in the past to denote essentially the same thing: activities related to the extraction of information from data to advance science, technology, and society. Statistics provides the tools (from concepts and methods to algorithms to operational software) needed to extract valid and reliable information from large data sets of diverse origin, and provides the methodologies to validate the models and quantify the inherent uncertainty. The students will engage in projects selected from (a) areas of genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, gene annotation, brain imaging, that rely to a very high degree on large and high-dimensional data sets, (b) environmental sciences, geophysics (including climate studies) astrophysics, cosmology, that regularly collect terabytes of high-dimensional data containing essential information about our World, and rely on knowledge extraction using tools inherent in statistical techniques, and (c) autonomous systems (e.g. autonomous cars) that make use of statistical techniques such as pattern recognition, statistical learning, and dimension reduction methodologies. In the last few years, there have been several national initiatives that require new statistical tools and theories, as well as an increased production of modernly trained statisticians. Prominent among these initiatives are: The brain initiative, the smart power grid initiative, big data and data analytics, climate change, and precision medicine; (3) Students will present their results at national meetings and they will be mentored in the preparation and presentation of their talks. Short courses in LaTeX, and software used for research purposes (Mathematica, MatLab, R) will be taught; (4) Visits to scientific facilities (e.g., Desert Research Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) will be organized. The progress of students for seven years (expected time for them to finish graduate school) after their participation will be monitored and annual evaluation of the program by the participating students and an external advisory committee will take place."
3.8,"Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation, tell us that ~85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter would be of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, operating deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, this is the most sensitive WIMP search in the world, and their reach is projected to grow by factor of eight by the end of 2007.<br/><br/>This proposal requests funding for the SuperCDMS 25 kg Experiment that will extend the direct-detection reach for WIMP dark matter by an additional two orders of magnitude. The collaboration will combine their preparation for moving to SNOLAB, to reduce the cosmogenic neutron level, with continued running of the CDMS detectors at the Soudan facility. <br/><br/>The technical development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, which have increasing applications. The project will expand its public outreach program at Soudan, transfer its experience to SNOLAB, will continue their involvement in K-12, collaborate with teachers and support promising high school students from underserved backgrounds."
0.15,"Our knowledge of properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter, especially the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy, is important for understanding many critical issues in nuclear physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The density and momentum dependence of the nucleon isovector potential is the most fundamental but currently very poorly known quantity determining properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter. Heavy-ion reactions, especially those induced by high energy radioactive beams, provide us the unique means to investigate properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter in terrestrial laboratories. In concert with the experimental efforts undertaken at several radioactive beam facilities in the US and abroad, I shall develop new theoretical tools to explore signatures of the density and momentum dependence of the isovector nucleon potential and the corresponding symmetry energy; continue to provide theoretical assistances in planning and data analyses of experiments; and evaluate timely astrophysical impact of the symmetry energy constrained by the latest terrestrial nuclear laboratory data.<br/><br/>While carrying out the proposed work, I will carefully integrate my research and the education of students. Several undergraduate and graduate students will participate in carrying out the proposed work. I will emphasize and encourage early involvement of undergraduate students in research. This experience not only plays a vital role in their complete education but also provides a solid basis for them to become next generation scientists and engineers. Moreover, the continued NSF funding will also help significantly improve the environment and infrastructure for research, especially in nuclear physics and astrophysics, at Texas A&M University-Commerce."
0.145992,"This project concerns a class of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) usually referred to as soliton equations or integrable systems. Over the past fifty years, a large body of knowledge has been accumulated on these systems, which continue to be extensively studied worldwide. Nonetheless, problems in which the boundary conditions play a crucial role still pose significant challenges. This project is aimed at undertaking a wide-ranging investigation of initial-boundary value problems for integrable NLEEs, both continuous and discrete, in both one and two spatial dimensions, including their applications in several concrete scientific and technological settings. This study will be carried out by developing and using exact methods, such as the inverse scattering transform and direct methods, in combination with appropriate asymptotic and numerical techniques. Specific problems that are being studied include: (i) nonlinear Schrodinger systems (scalar and vector, continuous and discrete) with non-zero boundary conditions at space infinity; (ii) boundary value problems for discrete and continuous NLEEs; (iii) characterization of soliton interactions for all of the above systems; (iv) classification of solitary wave structures in (2+1)-dimensional integrable systems such as the Davey-Stewartson system.<br/><br/>Nonlinear wave equations are well-known to model a variety of physically interesting phenomena arising in areas ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to plasmas, cosmology and quantum field theory. The study of these equations is especially attractive because it offers a unique combination of interesting mathematics and concrete physical/technological applications. In particular, the systems that will be studied in this project model wave propagation in water waves, optical fibers, lasers and Bose-Einstein condensates. Hence the outcomes of this project will not only advance our mathematical understanding, but they will also provide practical information that will help scientists and engineers. The training of undergraduate and graduate students is also an integral component of this project. One of the PIs has co-authored a monograph on NLS systems that has been referenced extensively and is helping the dissemination of knowledge in the field of nonlinear waves. Both PIs have a long record of working with both graduate and undergraduate students, and will work both with undergraduate students and with Ph.D. students as part of this project."

This project will systematically study different beyond-Standard-Model signals in terms of both the theoretical model-building and the interpretation of data. The primary data comes from detailed studies of the cosmic microwave background(CMB) and of the large scale structure (LSS) of the universe.

0.123408,"9706273 Craig The proposed research is on a class of partial differential equations which are unified by their character as wave equations and by the fact that they can each be written in the form of a Hamiltonian system. Important examples of this class are the linear and nonlinear Schroedinger equations, the nonlinear wave and Klein-Gordon equations, the Korteweg deVries equation, and the Euler equations governing free surface problems in fluid dynamics. The first project of the investigator is to consider issues of existence and regularity of the initial value problem for these equations, and it will continue a study of KAM tori and other constructions of the principal features of the infinite dimensional phase space in which these equations are posed. The second project is an analysis of dispersive linear equations, principally the Schroedinger equation, addressing details of the local and microlocal regularity of the fundamental solution and its relationship to the global behavior of bicharacteristics of the principal symbol. The third research project includes a special focus on the mathematical analysis of free surface problems of fluid dynamics. The nonlinear differential equations studied in this project occur in mathematical physics and engineering in a remarkable variety of settings, from cosmology to fluid dynamics of the ocean to nonlinear optics. Work in this field addresses some of the basic characteristics of solutions of these equations, which is a contribution to our knowledge of the physical world, and which can contribute in nontrivial ways to developments in advanced technology. This project also specifically pursues the purely mathematical goal of developing the beautiful analogy between the theory of classical mechanics of last century and the modern theory of partial differential equations."

0.05,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Ali Chamseddine at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon.<br/><br/>The quest for unification of fundamental physical interactions has been the subject of intensive research for nearly forty years. The stumbling block in this program is the inclusion of the gravitational force among the other three forces mediating the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions. These latter forces are very well understood in the framework of quantum field theory. In contrast, the gravitational force, because of its extreme weakness, is sizable only for macroscopic objects and is therefore mainly understood only at the classical level. Professor Chamseddine's research focuses on the development of a quantum theory of gravity. As such, research in this area promotes the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this work will also contribute to the advancement of knowledge in high-energy physics, gravitational physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.

One project of the MWA is to attempt to make sensitive, low-frequency observations from its radio-quiet site in Western Australia, to search for redshifted hydrogen from near the earliest epochs of the universe. As part of the project, much will be learned about observing at low frequencies with large arrays of individual antennas. This project will fund a the acquisition of a large (500 terrabyte) archive to store much of the raw data obtained from the MWA, which can then be studied and reprocessed at later dates to refine the design of similar future instruments."
0.045,"Recent progress in understanding the structure of String theory has come from understanding the web of duality symmetries relating nonperturbative effects to perturbative ones. This proposal focuses on developing a better understanding of these various dualities and their implication to the nonperturbative theory underlying string theory. The PI will study the interrelationships among the web of gauged and ungauged supergravities in various dimensions. The PI will also investigate the phenomenological implications of string theory to gravitational physics, particle physics and cosmology. A related topic the PI will investigate is the noncommutative nature of space-time at very high energies."
0.025,"This proposal requests continuing support for a program of research aimed at the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity. The program follows two distinct approaches: string theory and M-theory on the one hand; and noncommutative geometry on the other. The string theory approach involves such areas as supersymmetry, black holes, and branes, and the Co-PI involved in this effort is an acknowledged expert in the study of black holes. The noncommutative geometry approach considers the possibility that at extremely small, sub-Planckian distances space becomes quantized; the PI is one of the early pioneers of this approach and contributed to the foundations of it. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work lie in the area of education and research development in an under-developed region of the world, and they may have important consequences for related fields such as particle physics phenomenology and cosmology."

0.448541,"The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) is an array of 23 radio telescopes located at Cedar Flat, in the Inyo Mountains of California. The array is heterogeneous, consisting of six 10-m telescopes belonging to Caltech, nine 6-m telescopes from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association, and eight 3.5-m telescopes of The University of Chicago. Not all telescopes currently have the capability to observe at the same wavelength or frequency bandpasses simultaneously. The goal of being able to outfit all telescopes with receivers capable of observing at the same bandpass at the same time will soon be realized. A collaboration between Dr. John Carpenter of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. John Carlstrom of The University of Chicago will develop the digital correlators and receivers to fully integrate the CARMA telescopes into a single array that cross-correlates the signals from all 23 antennas simultaneously over the full 8 GHz IF bandwidth of the CARMA receivers. This will provide significantly enhanced observing capability and will enable new discoveries in cosmology (especially the study of galaxy clusters and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) and star formation (through the study of the chemistry and kinematics of molecular gas in star-forming regions).

0.370277,"Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. <br/><br/>With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.<br/><br/>This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists."
0.3,"This project concerns a class of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) usually referred to as soliton equations or integrable systems. Over the past fifty years, a large body of knowledge has been accumulated on these systems, which continue to be extensively studied worldwide. Nonetheless, problems in which the boundary conditions play a crucial role still pose significant challenges. This project is aimed at undertaking a wide-ranging investigation of initial-boundary value problems for integrable NLEEs, both continuous and discrete, in both one and two spatial dimensions, including their applications in several concrete scientific and technological settings. This study will be carried out by developing and using exact methods, such as the inverse scattering transform and direct methods, in combination with appropriate asymptotic and numerical techniques. Specific problems that are being studied include: (i) nonlinear Schrodinger systems (scalar and vector, continuous and discrete) with non-zero boundary conditions at space infinity; (ii) boundary value problems for discrete and continuous NLEEs; (iii) characterization of soliton interactions for all of the above systems; (iv) classification of solitary wave structures in (2+1)-dimensional integrable systems such as the Davey-Stewartson system.<br/><br/>Nonlinear wave equations are well-known to model a variety of physically interesting phenomena arising in areas ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to plasmas, cosmology and quantum field theory. The study of these equations is especially attractive because it offers a unique combination of interesting mathematics and concrete physical/technological applications. In particular, the systems that will be studied in this project model wave propagation in water waves, optical fibers, lasers and Bose-Einstein condensates. Hence the outcomes of this project will not only advance our mathematical understanding, but they will also provide practical information that will help scientists and engineers. The training of undergraduate and graduate students is also an integral component of this project. One of the PIs has co-authored a monograph on NLS systems that has been referenced extensively and is helping the dissemination of knowledge in the field of nonlinear waves. Both PIs have a long record of working with both graduate and undergraduate students, and will work both with undergraduate students and with Ph.D. students as part of this project."

The properties of the variability provide more information than can be obtained from static stars and they contribute greatly to our understanding of stellar structure and evolution, galactic evolution and cosmology. This project concerns modelling of stellar instability and understanding its systematics. A new nonlinear adaptive hydrodynamic code which produces better agreement between the models and the observations has been developed. This new method resolves and tracks the important physical features during the pulsation cycle. In this study, the results from the new code will be combined with the PI's previously developed semi-analytical theory of pulsation to gain insights into the mechanisms. The stars which will be considered range from the regularly varying Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars to the erratic RV Tauri stars and Semi-regular variables. The effects of stochastic noise on pulsations and methods of analysis of time-dependent signals will also be studied in the context of comparing the theoretical results with observation."
0.095,"Evolutionary biology has always been controversial: in Darwin's time, there was the famous debate in Britain between Bishop ""Soapy Sam"" Wilburforce and Thomas Huxley; at the turn of the century, there was the Skopes ""monkey"" trial in the US; and today, there have been efforts in, for example, Louisiana to require that ""creationism"" be taught alongside the ""theory"" of evolution. Yet the most serious attacks on Darwin's theory came not from religion but from science itself. In the 19th century, physicists led by Lord Kelvin argued that the earth was too ""young"" to have allowed enough time for evolution to have occurred. With the discovery of natural radiation, however, the age of the earth was greatly increased to several billions of years--old enough for evolution to occur. But where physics failed, Mendelian and population genetics stepped in with a scientific assault on Darwin's principle of natural selection. It wasn't until the late 1930's and 1940's that evolutionary biology was reconciled with genetics. The first person to propose this synthesis was Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900- 1975) in his Genetics and the Origin of Species, (1937). With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening of the Russian archives to Western scholars, Dr. Mark Adams is undertaking the first full-scale study of this founder of modern Western population genetics. Dr. Adams is focussing his study of Dobzhansky on the period 1900 to 1937 when ""Dobbie"" published his book launching the evolutionary biology synthesis. He is also pursuing the persistent Russian dimension of Dobbie's work even after he moved to the United States (1927). Dr. Adams aims to clarify the influence of the Kiev school of cytogenetics on Dobzhansky's chromosomal work (1914-1924); the views of his Petersburg mentor, Filipchenko, on his approach to micro- and macroevolution, and on his social views (1924-27) the influence of Russian entomological traditions on his approach to populations, species, and field practice; his gradual assimilation of the conventions and practices of T. H. Morgan's laboratory when he came to the United States; the influence of his Russian background on the writing of his evolutionary classic; his role in supporting Russian geneticists and opposing Lysenkoism during the period 1937-1960; and the abiding influence of his formative Russian years in shaping the worldview that informed both his research and writings on heredity, society, cosmology, and the human conditions, 1960-1974."

3.210543,"Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will extend the understanding of the particles produced at present and planned accelerators, including the photon, W and Z particles, the electron, and . and their neutrinos, and quarks and gluons. It will concentrate on the physics responsible for the masses of many of these particles. This is the principal unsolved mystery in the standard model of the basic forces. The research will also deepen our understanding of quantum field theory, which provides the most useful mathematical language for the study of this physics. This language is important in other fields (condensed matter physics, for example) as well as in particle physics. This project also will focus on aspects of string theory. Specific areas of inquiry in string theory will include quantum gravity, aspects of strings propagating in a space (in particular, the study of strings in the context of cosmology and black holes), and topological field theories. String theory has been perhaps the most active area of research in high energy physics in the past seven years. Research in string theory is very important since string theory is the only known fundamental theory which reconciles quantum theory with Einstein's theory of gravity. This project will play an important role in the advancement of this subject by studying, classifying and unifying various solutions to string theory. Finally, the project will investigate the relations of elementary particles to objects and processes that cannot be directly studied at accelerators, such as the dark matter in the universe, black holes produced by gravitational collapse, grand unified theories and baryon number production in the early history of the universe."

0.097514,"The project explores the geometry and topology of three-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, those which admit a Riemannian metric with negative sectional curvatures. Some of the most fundamental questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds concern the extent to which their properties are inherited in, or, conversely, may develop among covering spaces of finite degree. The famous virtual Haken and virtual fiberering conjectures answer this description, for example, as do the questions below. Given a hyperbolic 3-manifold with a special topological property, for instance a knot complement, with how many others that have this same property does it share a finite-degree cover? Or for a fixed hyperbolic 3-manifold M and a family of finite-degree covers {M_n}, does the rank of the fundamental group of M_n grow linearly with the covering degree? This relates to the fixed price question in the study of topological dynamics. The PI intends to continue his attacks on these and other questions, such as the possibility of embedding in right-angled Artin groups. He will also further describe the topology of hyperbolic manifolds with low volume.<br/><br/><br/>The objects of study here, 3-manifolds, are spaces which look, in a neighborhood of each point, like the familiar three-dimensional space in which we live. Although their definition allows quite a bit of flexibility, 3-manifolds share with 2-manifolds (surfaces) the property that each admits a unique best metric, a way of measuring the distance between two points in the space. This property of low-dimensional manifolds, known in dimension 3 as Thurston's geometrization conjecture and proven recently by V. Perelman, has motivated an enormous body of work that uses geometry as a tool for understanding 3-manifolds, and the project follows this broad theme. The study of 3-manifolds has benefited from its interaction with many different fields of mathematics, and the project additionally draws from questions and techniques in the study of topological dynamics, geometric flows, geometric group theory, and others. <br/>The project will help us better understand the classification of 3-manifolds and the relationships between them. This in turn has applications in such diverse fields as cosmology (in determining the shape of the universe, for example), biology (in understanding the knotting of DNA), and computer science (through connections with families of graphs that certain families of 3-manifolds coarsely resemble), among others."
0.08,"Last year, antihydrogen was trapped for the first time by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN. By this point hundreds of antiatoms have been trapped for times as long as 1000 s. While this was a remarkable achievement, the ALPHA apparatus is not well configured for most measurements of the properties of antihydrogen, and must be rebuilt to allow laser and better microwave access. Furthermore, the trapping rates, while sufficient to begin studies of the properties of antimatter, are lower than optimal. There are two broad challenges to improving the trapping rate: (1) Understanding the behavior of the positron and antiproton plasmas from which the antihydrogen is synthesized; and (2) Understanding the atomic processes by which positrons and antiprotons recombine. Antihydrogen synthesis lies on the boundary between atomic and plasma physics, and cannot be studied properly without employing tools from both fields. The long term goal of antihydrogen research is to search for differences between the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences might occur between the spectra of the two species. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. Another place differences might occur is in the gravitational interactions of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences could solve the baryogenesis problem. A third area of potential difference is in the fractional charge of antihydrogen. The net charge of antihydrogen is only known to about 10^-7 relative to the unit charge. Positive results from any of these measurements would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. <br/><br/>The long-¬term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-¬antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. The trapping of antihydrogen last year was extraordinarily widely noted in the lay and scientific press. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The proposed research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups."

37.710839,"The University of Chicago in collaboration with Princeton University, AT&T Bell Laboratories and other institutions, will establish a Science and Technology Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica. The Center will be directed by Professor D. A. Harper. Infrared and submillimeter astronomy have the potential for unlocking some of the major questions concerning the formation of the Universe, including inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background radiation, the processes by which stars form from interstellar gas, the formation of planets, the observation of primeval galaxies, and the inhomogeneous distribution of matter and energy in the early Universe. The goal of the Center is to establish an observatory at the South Pole with three major instruments designed to probe the far reaches of the Universe at wavelengths ranging from 2 to 3000 microns. Three experiments will be set up as follows: ASTRO (Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory) will use a 1.7 meter diameter submillimeter telescope whis is already being built to make a survey of the Galactic plane, the Galactic Center and the Magellanic Clouds using the emission from the fine-structure line of carbon at 609 microns and the line of carbon monoxide at 650 microns. SPIREX (South Pole Infrared Explorer) will use an existing 60 centimeter diameter near-infrared telescope to explore the potential of the South Pole as an infrared site and to make initial deep 2.4 micron continuum surveys for primeval galaxies and brown dwarf stars. This spectral window is also located within a ""hole"" in the celestial background and may afford the most sensitive view of light from galaxies forming in the early universe. At this wavelength, a South Pole telescope will be more sensitive than the Hubble telescope and 200 times more sensitive than a ground-based telescope at a mid-latitude site. COBRA (Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy) is an instrument to be built that will search for and map anisotropies in the Cosmic Background Radiation on angular scales ranging from 15 arcminutes to 20 degrees at sufficient sensitivity to definitively test current theories of the origin of the Universe. The significance of this Center is that it will provide facilities to enable measurements at wavelengths that are badly hampered by the absorption and emission of the Earth's atmosphere. Nowhere on Earth are the infrared skies clearer or darker than above the Antarctic Plateau mainly due to a lack of water vapor in the air. It will overcome the diurnal variations in temperature that lead to atmospheric noise and wind at higher latitudes, and much of the infrared background radiation. (The decrease in environmental temperature from 300K to 210-230 K results in an enormous decrease in background radiation.) The elevation of the Antarctic plateau will significantly reduce the atmospheric path the light must traverse. The geographic singularity of a Polar site also allows a unique opportunity to reduce systematic errors in searches for cosmic microwave background anisotropies. All these factors should combine to improve the observing conditions by a factor of 10 to 100."
0.612965,"This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Networking Technology and Systems Program in the Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Directorate for Computer Information Science and Engineering; the Mathematical Physics Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>Two grand challenges in two disjoint fields of science are network dynamics prediction and quantum gravity theory. The lack of understanding of fundamental laws driving the dynamics of many complex networks, and consequently our inability to predict and control their behavior, are among the reasons why many practical problems of great significance remain unsolved for decades. The lack of a complete theory of quantum gravity, unifying all the fundamental interactions, is perhaps the most fundamental problem in physics after Einstein. Motivated by the recent results suggesting that the two problems might in fact be intimately related via a geometric duality between hyperbolic and de Sitter spaces---the former reflecting the latent geometry of complex networks, the latter representing the asymptotic geometry of spacetime in the universe---this project addresses both grand challenges and advances science in both fields by deriving fundamental laws of network dynamics. <br/><br/>The main hypothesis that the project investigates is that one can extend and apply the canonical approach in physics used to study all the fundamental interactions in nature to a wide class of physical systems---complex networks. One part of the project focuses on finding Hamiltonians defining Hamilton's equations of network dynamics, and validating the derived equations against the dynamics of real networks. These equations are expected to be simpler than the corresponding equations in gravitational theories. Other parts of the project focus on building tools to predict this dynamics based on the derived equations, and investigating connections between this dynamics, its conformal invariance in the de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (dS/CFT) context, and network navigability that may lead to a different interpretation of the dark energy problem in cosmology. This interdisciplinary project combines concepts and methods from mathematical physics and network research by extending the canonical approach in physics to complex networks to advance our understanding of their dynamics, and to explore whether applying theoretical concepts in network science will advance our understanding of dark energy. This project thus opens exciting new research directions by hypothesizing a fundamental connection between Hamiltonian dynamics and network dynamics that until now have been considered completely unrelated. The transformative project thus challenges the conventional wisdom that neither the canonical approach in physics can be useful in studying complex networks, nor network science has anything to offer theoretical physics. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Many problems of broader impacts in science and society are blocked on network dynamics prediction. Examples include disease treatment, drug design, and a variety of link-prediction problems, which are sub-problems of network dynamics prediction. In general, connections between systems as different as the brain, the Internet, and the universe, appeal to general public, foster creative thinking, and attract wider and more diverse circles of students to science and engineering."

Trilling and Buie both participate in the ongoing, large-scale Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) for KBOs and will use the DES database as the backbone of their science endeavors. The tasks to be carried out are as follows. Trilling will make new observations in the DES program. Trilling and Buie will also carry out a comprehensive photometry program that will be used to calibrate the DES catalog. Both of these observing tasks will make extensive use of telescopes in Arizona and Chile. Lastly, Trilling and Buie will carry out completeness experiments on the DES catalog. These three tasks prepare the way for scientific analysis of the Kuiper Belt using the 500 DES KBOs. The first step of the science analysis will be to carry out a statistical study of the DES data in combination with other surveys' data to derive, with strong confidence, the differential sky density of KBOs. This mathematical expression can be directly related to accretion timescales through theoretical models to provide a tight constraint on the duration of accretion in the Kuiper Belt. Lastly, combining the DES dataset with newly available KBO albedo information from the Space Infrared Telescope Facility allows a true KBO size distribution to be derived for the first time. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of these technical tasks and science goals lies in the quest to understand<br/>how the outer Solar System formed and evolved. The results derived here will be crucially important in constraining and driving the next generation of outer Solar System accretion models. These models have impact beyond the Kuiper Belt, as planets in the Solar System (and beyond) underwent accretion as part of their formation processes. This program will have a broader impact in the community primarily through participation in the University of Arizona Space Grant program. Through the Space Grant program, Trilling will recruit one undergraduate research intern per year from among the diverse pool of applications. This series of students will have specific research tasks, including participating in observing runs. Trilling will also participate in Space Grant's Science Speakers program to present science results in classrooms and to the general public. Such a program uniquely allows bringing knowledge to communities of racial, ethnic, and economic diversity. Lastly, in addition to public outreach, this research program will produce an extensive photometric catalog, which will be widely available, and will calibrate the large DES archive, which will also be available for use in various other scientific projects from Solar System science to cosmology."
10.45,"Two recent developments have revolutionized atomic physics: The observation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), and a series of theoretical and experimental advances in quantum information. Atomic quantum fluids and quantum information theory are now among the most active and exciting areas of physics. Their common denominator is many-body quantum mechanics. Strongly correlated quantum systems realize some of the most fundamental states of matter, which are important for understanding phenomena in cosmology, condensed matter, nuclear and many other areas of physics. Ultracold atoms have become a test bed to tackle old and unresolved, and conceptually new questions in quantum systems of interacting particles.<br/><br/>The Center for Ultracold Atoms is building on the technical capabilities developed in its first phase and the advent of five new faculty members to focus on these areas. The deep questions that motivate this quest are the nature of high-temperature superconductivity, unresolved basic problems in quantum magnetism (e.g. antiferromagnetic frustration, spin liquids), and the desire to develop a deeper understanding and experimental control of entanglement. The quest is an exploration and control of the quantum world, uncovering and using unknown parts of the vast Hilbert space of possible wave functions. The ultimate pay-off could be the discovery of materials with novel properties, insight into how to increase the transition temperature of superconductors, and major advances towards the realization of quantum information systems.<br/><br/>To pursue this vision the Center is organizing its research program around two themes, strongly correlated states of ultracold atoms and quantum state control of atoms and photons. The first theme is centered on many-body physics and strongly overlaps with condensed matter physics. The second involves the interactions of a few or several atoms and photons, their entanglement and quantum state manipulation. These topics will be pursued by a team of eight Senior Investigators. Five of these are new to CUA, and their interests are a major driving force for the new research program. They have joined the vibrant CUA community that consists of approximately 65 graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and 15 postdocs. All the research will be performed on campus in CUA facilities, and will be fully integrated with the teaching and education programs at MIT and Harvard, through research opportunities for undergraduates, lab tours, and by being used in lectures as illustrations for basic concepts in physics. The Center reaches out to the community through the organization of a summer school, sponsorship of workshops, an annual program to recruit new science teachers, the creation of a virtual journal for ultracold atoms, a weekly seminar, and a visitor's program.<br/><br/>Funding for the CUA is provided by the Division of Physics through the Physics Frontiers Centers program and the Division of Materials Research through the Condensed Matter Physics program."
0.305447,"Evolution Problem in General Relativity <br/><br/>Abstract of Proposed Research<br/>Sergiu Klainerman<br/><br/><br/>The research focuses on the mathematical analysis of the evolution of the solutions of the Einstein-field equations. Attention will be concentrated on a number of conjectures about these solutions. One concerns the relationship between the curvature tensor and the causal geometry of space-time. Two concern the phenomenon of ""cosmic censorship"", other concerns the asymptotic behavior or ""final state"" and one about the stability of the Kerr solution. The resolution of these problems will require the study of the relationship between geometry and curvature of Lorentzian manifolds as well as analysis of the Einstein equations. <br/><br/>Einstein's equations are the field equations of general relativity and their analysis is central to the understanding of many issues in cosmology including the theory of black holes and gravitational waves. There are only a few exact solutions known of these equations and this research will pursue a more mathematical analysis that will prove qualitative results about the solutions. This analysis should also help the development of algorithms for the numerical computation of solutions of these equations."

2.49894,"Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. <br/><br/>With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.<br/><br/>This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists."
0.180862,"AST 0098625<br/>Stone<br/>A wide variety of objects, ranging from new stars in formation (protostars), to objects which are the cinders of burned out stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes), to active galactic nuclei (AGN, such as quasars) are thought to have accretion disks surrounding them. Inflows of gas from these disks onto the central object seem to account for some of the most dramatic components of the Universe. They emit prodigious amounts of power and radiate it over a tremendous swath of the electromagnetic spectrum (from the mid-infrared to hard X-rays and gamma rays). Our theoretical understanding of these accretion flows, however, is still limited by the complexities involved in developing the necessary magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and radiation hydrodynam-ics computer models. Our understanding of the local physics that control such flows has progressed rapidly in the last few years. It is now important to examine how local processes such as the magnetorotational instability (MRI) determine global disk structure and evolution, especially since only global disk models can be directly compared to high spatial-, spectral-, and time-resolution observations of accretion flows around protostars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.<br/>Using computational methods, this project will develop the first time-dependent, three-dimensional MHD models of the interaction of an accretion disk with a magnetized and rotating central star. These calculations will allow quantitative measurement of the mixing rate of the stellar field into the disk, the size of the interaction region, the time-averaged torque exerted on the star, and the geometry and kinematics of any polar cap accretion flows that might form. Such quantities are fundamental to the theory of how magnetized stars interact with accretion disks, yet to date they have yet to be calculated from first principles. Direct comparison of the simulations to a large and varied set of observations will be undertaken, including spectroscopic observations of magnetospheric funnel flows and accretion shocks in T Tauri stars, and the observed distribution of the rotation rates in T Tauri stars. Synthetic spectra of the models will be compared to that observed for accreting black holes at the center of early type galaxies and the galactic center, while fluctuations in the mass accretion rate can be compared to X-ray variabil-ity observed by RXTE in X-ray binaries. These global calculations are the first step towards star-disk interaction models which span many decades in radius.<br/>The calculations will all be performed with a variety of 2D and 3D MHD computer codes, using large allocations of supercomputer time on massively parallel machines at the national supercomputer centers. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"

0.204955,"FRG<br/><br/>Geometric Function Theory is a broad area of mathematics that has its roots in the classical theory of analytic functions of one complex variable. From the very beginning this field has had connections to potential theory, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, and geometric topology. The second half of the twentieth century brought about new areas like quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, with links to nonlinear PDEs and harmonic analysis. The research group is planning to tackle some of the most important open problems in this broadly construed field by using our diverse strengths. Examples of the problems include understanding the integrability properties of derivatives of conformal mappings, finding criteria for recognizing metric spaces up to bi-Lipschitz or quasiconformal equivalence, further developing the theory of holomorphic curves and its quasiregular generalizations, and investigating algebraic conditions related to quasiconvexity of energy functionals. The intellectual merit of our activity will be found in a deepened understanding of fundamental questions in Geometric Function Theory, in an increase of the links to other fields of mathematics, and in a broader scope of possible applications.<br/><br/>Core mathematics keeps reappearing outside its own realm with dramatic success and consequences. Recent examples range from cosmology (where deep topological issues arise regarding the proposed new dimensions for the universe) to material science (where deformation of elastic bodies are studied by methods of the Calculus of Variations) to engineering (where function theoretic methods have led to advances in control theory). The latter two examples are directly connected with the work of our research group, as are topological issues pertaining to the geometry of three dimensional spaces. Another new feature with possible far reaching reverberations is to use function theoretic methods in studying spaces that are not smooth in the classical sense; such spaces naturally occur when Riemannian structures degenerate and form singularities. The main strength of our group is that its members have common roots, but multifarious interests, so as to make advancement in and connections between separate fields. The broader impact of our activity will be the education of new scholars who understand the methods and techniques in the field, and who know how to find applications of their knowledge to other parts of mathematics and sciences. We will put great weight on passing on the important questions to the younger generation and on enabling them to perform independent research."
0.585908,"Supernovae are involved in many of the most pressing current questions in astrophysics. In particular, Type Ia supernovae are called on to provide much of the iron in the Universe, and their bright, almost uniform explosions allow the mapping of the Universe''s expansion. In spite of this importance, the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae are still not unambiguously identified, and the explosion mechanism itself is poorly understood. But several trends in recent years have brought new hope of progress. On the theoretical front, progenitor systems involving a single degenerate star accreting from a companion have been shown to produce a strong, fast wind for substantial periods of time before the explosion. The effects of this wind on the system''s surroundings, and on the companion star itself, have not yet been well modeled. At the same time, evidence has been mounting that at least a few Type Ia supernovae do involve interaction with circumstellar material, while high-velocity absorption lines are now commonly seen in Type Ia spectra. Light (and infrared) echos have been seen from a few Type Ia systems, indicating in some cases dust quite close to the supernova. Finally, supernova remnants are revealing far more about their birth events than had been thought possible, primarily through X-ray spectroscopy. Evidence of ejecta is clearly seen in significant numbers of remnants with ages up to and beyond 10,000 years. In addition, some supernova remnants, such as Kepler''s, show clear evidence for prior interaction with a dense circumstellar medium. <br/><br/>These tantalizing clues may hold the key to the nature of not just a few anomalous Type Ia supernovae, but of the entire Type Ia phenomenon. In this project, Dr. Reynolds and collaborators will undertake a series of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations designed to connect the progenitor systems, the supernovae themselves, and their remnants. The effect of a fast white-dwarf wind on the companion and on surrounding material will be studied in order to characterize the immediate pre-supernova environment. Model explosions will be set off in the midst of these environments to identify optical, infrared, and radio clues to the interaction with circumstellar material, both to explain observed systems and to interpret upper limits when emission is not seen. The supernovae will be numerically evolved to the age of young supernova remnants such as Kepler, to compare with their structure, and then followed to much larger ages, to compare with several Magellanic Cloud remnants which seemingly require strong circumstellar interaction to explain their X-ray properties.<br/><br/>The results of this work will have broad applicability. The question of the nature of Type Ia supernova origins is connected with some of the most significant questions in astronomy today, with implications for galactic chemical evolution as well as cosmology. This work will allow a much tighter connection to be drawn between supernova remnants, the supernovae that produce them, and the progenitors of those supernovae, to the mutual benefit of all three areas of research. Graduate students, undergraduates, and high-school students will be involved in all aspects of this work. The results of this research will also be used by Dr. Reynolds and collaborators in their continued outreach efforts to groups from amateur astronomers to elementary-school children."

The present award, supplemented by contributions from LSST member institutions, will allow the LSST Project to build on their existing efforts to meet the requirements of a Final Design Review (FDR) and to be ready for construction. The priorities for this support are: 1) Moving the project to become construction-ready by completing the specifications and the bidding process for the major components of the telescope and support facility; 2) Developing improved algorithms for data processing with emphasis on those that drive the sizing model for computing hardware; 3) Implementing the PDR recommendations, which provide important guidelines for moving the project toward construction readiness; 4) Implementing an Earned Value Management System and updating costing and other documentation required for FDR; 5) Completing staffing of the senior management team that will carry out the construction phase; and 6) Continuing risk reduction through hardware and software prototyping and system simulations.<br/><br/>The LSST data management system needs innovative, large-scale database techniques.

0.115,"An isolated neutron lives for about fifteen minutes before disintegrating into three lighter particles. This fundamental process plays a significant role in cosmology, and its study complements current efforts to discover new physics. Two laboratory techniques exist to determine the lifetime of a neutron with high precision, but they disagree significantly in their reported values. This discrepancy must be addressed in order to realize the potential of these techniques to help probe new physics. The research conducted with this award directly supports that effort by examining the behavior of very low energy (or ""ultracold"") neutrons which are magnetically confined in order to determine the neutron lifetime. The research involves a broad set of ideas and skills appropriate for undergraduate involvement and will be used to form the kernel for an interdisciplinary undergraduate research training, mentoring, and outreach program at Tennessee Technological University. <br/><br/>Research activities will be carried out in conjunction with the UCNtau collaboration, which has constructed a magneto-gravitational ultracold neutron trap with a long intrinsic neutron storage time and demonstrated a detection strategy capable of making multiple high-precision measurements in a single accelerator cycle at the Los Alamos National Laboratory ultracold neutron source. Losses due to spin evolution in this trap will be empirically characterized by developing a high-fidelity spin-tracking Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment which, when combined with measurements of the mean trap lifetime as a function of the polarization-preserving ambient magnetic field magnitude, will be used to characterize indirectly the loss rate associated with spin evolution in the trap, sufficient for completing measurement of the neutron lifetime to an accuracy of one second. Measurements in a dedicated test cell will provide information necessary to assess directly the effect of spin evolution in a very high-precision (well below 0.1%) magnetic trap measurement of the free neutron lifetime."

0.268224,"Mathematically, this research project falls into the broad category of algebraic geometry, one of the most varied areas of today's mathematics. Fundamentally, algebraic geometry is the study and classification of geometric objects described by algebraic equations through manipulation of the input data using a wide array of mathematical tools. Because of its diversity, algebraic geometry permeates such different branches of science as robotics, cosmology, and computer encryption. The origins of algebraic geometry can be traced to the works of Euclid and Pythagoras. In its modern form, the focus of algebraic geometry is on singularities, which are points that are unusual when compared to their neighbors. Examples of singularities include cusps such as the tip of a funnel cloud, or self-intersections such as the center in a figure-of-eight; they indicate states in which a given physical system becomes anomalous. This project also contributes to the training of the next generation of researchers by engaging graduate as well as undergraduate students in research. <br/><br/>The main focus of this project is the study of singularities through cohomological methods. To a singularity defined by a set of polynomial equations one may attach several invariants; these may be of discrete type (such as the number of branches of a curve meeting in a point) or of continuous nature (such as the space of all vector fields tangent to the singularity). If one considers a family of singularities, such invariants behave in interesting ways: on one side, at special members of the family they ""jump"" (that is, get larger in some sense), and such jumps are often accompanied by an appropriate nonzero local cohomology group. The singularities where jumps occur typically exhibit worse behavior than their neighbors. On the other side, near typical members of the family, the invariants often deform according to so-called ""hypergeometric"" differential equations. One component of this project investigates, using local cohomology and combinatorial methods, jumps and solutions of the appearing hypergeometric differential equations. The other part of the project is concerned with the study of specific invariants in families of singularities derived through either calculus (the Gauss--Manin connection and Bernstein--Sato polynomial), counting techniques (the Igusa zeta function), or deformations (cohomology of the Milnor fiber), and their interplay."
0.271307,"Even after more than a decade of great discoveries, the neutrino remains the most mysterious of the known fundamental particles. Basic questions about its properties endure; the most basic being whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle. If true, this Majorana nature of the neutrino would have profound implications to particle physics and cosmology, including an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The only feasible experimental probes of the Majorana nature of the neutrino are experiments searching for the rare nuclear process, neutrinoless double-beta decay. The current set of experiments will probe the parameter space for Majorana neutrinos in the inverted mass hierarchy. The next generation of experiments will need to push into the normal mass hierarchy which requires an order of magnitude increase in mass and background suppression. <br/><br/>Liquid scintillator detectors scale well to large masses but advances are needed to obtain increased background suppression.

0.157629,"AST 0206205<br/><br/>PI Nice<br/><br/>Pulsars are strongly magnetized, rapidly spinning neutron stars, the collapsed remnants of supernova explosions. They are extraordinarily stable natural clocks, in some cases approaching or exceeding the long-term stabilities of the best man-made clocks. Well over 1000 pulsars are now known, and several dozen of them are gravitationally bound to another star, with orbital velocities up to a thousandth of the speed of light. For these and many other reasons,<br/>high-precision observations of pulsars offer unique opportunities for research in stellar evolution, gravitation physics, cosmology, fundamental astrometry, and even time-keeping metrology.<br/><br/>This project will extend and improve a series of very-high precision timing measurements of binary and millisecond pulsars as refined tests of relativistic effects, and in the search for perturbations in pulse times series due to passing gravitational waves. They will also search the sky for new pulsars, particularly those with very short periods, and they will accumulate timing data for more than 100 slow pulsars, as a service to observers at other wavelengths and to study pulsar rotation irregularities.<br/>***"
0.376242,"Over the last few years observational as well as theoretical evidence has accumulated that nonradial modes are more important than traditionally expected in the pulsations of RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids, and perhaps in the Long Period Variables as well. All these stars play a vital role in Astronomy and Cosmology and a thorough understanding of their properties is therefore imperative. <br/><br/>Here, a 2 and 3-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics code will be developed to make numerical simulations of full amplitude nonradial pulsations of these stars with the goal of explaining the recent observational data. The time is ripe for such novel numerical simulations despite their complicated nature, and the necessary computing power is available. It is anticipated that this study will also shed new light on the long standing problem of the Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae stars. <br/><br/>The techniques that will be employed here are expected to be very useful in other research areas as well, ranging from astronomy to nonlinear dynamics to medicine. The final numerical codes will be made publicly available after thorough testing. Support is included here for an undergraduate student who will be exposed to scientific research through this project and a postdoctoral research associate will be trained in multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations. This research will also be brought into the general education classroom through Dr. Buchler's teaching activities."
0.225,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of large backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. However, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the galaxy, yielding a day-night modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. Of current searches with directional detectors, the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment is a leader, having a decade of experience. The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFT's unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. <br/><br/>These advances in background rejection, combined with the fact that further limit setting capabilities are hampered by the small volume of DRIFT-II, suggest that DRIFT should scale-up. This award will enable the collaboration to continue running DRIFT-II in the Boulby mine in England. In addition to running DRIFT-IId, these funds will provide hardware for a second detector, DRIFT-IIe.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of hardware and software experience. Finally, the DRIFT detector technology has promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments."

0.051,"DMS-9504556 Goldstein The investigator intends to continue his analysis of Bohmian mechanics, which defines a deterministic dynamical system involving a novel combination of ordinary and partial differential equations having remarkable properties. The proposed research involves (1) an analysis of the possibility of relativistic extensions of Bohmian mechanics, (2) comparisons of Bohmian mechanics with the major competing alternative formulations of quantum theory, and (3) an analysis of the foundations of statistical mechanics from a Bohmian perspective. The importance of the proposed research lies in the following observations: 1) The foundations of quantum theory, the most fundamental of all physical theories, continue to be mired in confusion and incoherence some sixty-five years after its inception. 2) Bohmian mechanics is the natural embedding of Schroedinger's equation, which is the mathematical core of almost all interpretations of quantum theory, into a clear, precise physical theory. It emerges if one merely insists that this equation be directly relevant to the motion of particles. In other words, Bohmian mechanics arises, roughly speaking, from Schroedinger's equation when (perhaps naively) we insist upon the simplest ontology---particles described by their positions---and seek a natural law of motion for this ontology. 3) All the mysteries of quantum theory find a compelling explanation in Bohmian mechanics---in effect, in the obvious ontology evolving in the obvious way! 4) An appreciation of Bohmian mechanics can be the source of enormous flexibility and clarity when one attempts to apply quantum theory in new directions---for example, to understand the implications of macroscopic interference effects---and to new domains, such as quantum cosmology. 5) The underlying principle behind the value of Bohmian mechanics is that it really does help to formulate physical theories with sufficient clarity that they can genuinely be understood."

The<br/>recent progress and influx of new ideas from Ricci flow,<br/>pluripotential theory and the minimal model program in algebraic<br/>geometry have unravelled a deep, rich and unifying structure.<br/>The PI will investigate the limiting behavior of the Kahler-Ricci<br/>flow and its connection to the classification theory for<br/>algebraic varieties, inspired by Perelman's breakthrough in<br/>Hamilton's program to resolve the geometrization conjecture by<br/>Ricci flow.

The first project is aimed at finding new constructions of stable and metastable vacua in string theory as well as new Kahler moduli stabilization mechanisms. These problems are essential for a complete understanding of the string theory landscape. The goal of the second project is finding an algebraic quantization scheme for holomorphic branes, or, equivalently, derived objects on Calabi-Yau threefolds, using large N duality, noncommutative algebraic geometry and integrable systems. The third project aims at finding a microscopic description of string theory black holes with magnetic charge based on Atiyah-Bott localization in higher dimensional gauge theory. <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>The questions addressed in this work have a broader impact in physics and mathematics. Understanding the string theory landscape and especially vacuum selection mechanisms will have immediate impact in stringy cosmology, stringy phenomenology and quantum gravity. Extremal transitions and large N duality have already had a considerable impact on certain areas of mathematics such as Gromov-Witten theory and knot theory. The Pi intends to explore the impact of large N duality in other areas such as derived categories, integrable systems and holomorphic quantization emphasizing interdisciplinary research methods. Similarly, finding a microscopic description of black hole degrees of freedom is a fundamental question in theoretical physics. The PI proposes a new approach to this problem based on an interplay of localization, algebraic geometry and physics. The results of this work will be presented at interdisciplinary conferences, seminars and workshops.

Our imperfect knowledge of the content and distribution of dark matter in galaxies is a major obstacle to our current understanding of the structure and formation of galaxies. This project has three parts all of which are designed to measure the dark matter content of different galaxies. Two of these research projects will attempt to quantify the amount of dark matter in spiral galaxies and the third will search for a possible systematic difference between the dark matter content of barred galaxies and of their unbarred counterparts.

0.33,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education on heavy electron materials and local moment physics. The new concepts required to understand these low-energy materials, will, in many cases scale up in energy and temperature to describe related phenomenon in transition Metal materials, such as copper and iron-based superconductors. Many of the key questions in this area touch upon issues of fundamental importance, such as the physics of quantum criticality, mechanisms of anisotropic superconductivity, and the origins of non-Fermi liquid behavior. Motivated by the discovery of two new and unusual heavy fermion superconductors, the PI will apply a new type of large-N expansion for heavy electron superconductivity that he has recently developed. Fresh insights in heavy electron quantum criticality and the discovery of a Kondo spin liquid material inspire the PI to embark on a new set of investigations into the phase diagram of the Kondo lattice. A magnetically tuned critical end point in a multiferroic oxide has recently been discovered. The PI will pursue a new research program to study field-tuned quantum criticality in multiferroic materials.<br/><br/>Research into the various aspects of ""hard condensed matter physics"" plays an essential driving role in both the development of new physics concepts, and new ideas for materials of the future. For example, the remarkable tendency of quantum critical points to nucleate superconductivity and other new phases of matter is of great interest to materials development; on the other hand, the new universality classes of quantum phase transition are of great fundamental interest and, like their classical predecessors in statistical mechanics, may enjoy generalization and future application in the realm of cosmology and particle physics. This is wonderful area for students to learn the advanced methods of theoretical physics, while maintaining an intimate contact with experimental physics and real materials.<br/><br/>The PI is strongly committed to diversity in physics, with a long record of support for women in physics.

The interplay of electrons in itinerant quantum states and quantum states localized around a rare-earth or actinide atom leads to an unusual metallic state with properties that are consistent with the textbooks. The properties of these materials are further complicated by the existence of quantum phase transitions - phase transitions that occur at the absolute zero of temperature but with a powerful influence that can be felt over a range of temperature. The PI will build on and use a promising new method that he has developed to gain insight into two recently discovered materials in this class that are superconductors and into heavy electron materials more generally. The PI will also study the superconducting states of these materials. The PI will further explore the role quantum phase transitions play in newly discovered multiferroic materials which are a promising class of materials for future electronic devices. <br/><br/>The study of the superconducting states and the unusual metallic states which give way to superconductivity contributes to the intellectual foundations of materials research and superconductivity. This knowledge may lead to harnessing the ability of superconductors to carry electric current with no to very low power dissipation in a practical way leading to significant energy savings. <br/><br/>The PI is strongly committed to diversity in physics, with a long record of support for women in physics.

This makes it an ideal training ground for students of condensed matter physics. The PI's recent success in applying the Schwinger boson to fully screened Kondo models opens up a unique opportunity to connect magnetism and heavy electron physics, an important component of this project. The recent discovery of the charge Kondo effect in doped PbTe, confirming a past prediction of the PI, motivates a new program to adapt tools and concepts from magnetism and spin physics to systems with preformed pairs and slow charge fluctuations.

0.25,"Cyber-based scientific investigations involve complex problems with massive multifaceted data from distributed sources including computational simulations, high dimensional sensing/data collections, and meta-data analysis. Examples include: large scale scientific computational simulations used in cosmology, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, climate studies, oceanography, geology, and aeronautics; geological exploration; biological system analysis (bioinformatics); security information analysis; and multimedia analysis (video, text, image processing). Visualization and computer-based interaction combined with analytical reasoning are crucial components enabling us to tackle these immense large scale problems. Little is known, however, about how people access and interpret current visualization techniques. As the graphics capabilities of commodity PC's become more powerful, more sophisticated techniques are increasingly available to the novice user. Anyone can download programs to view 3D MRI/CT or view satellite maps and other observation data. Currently, there is no general scientific curriculum teaching ""scientific visualization literacy"" for more than simple graphs and plots, and there is an implicit expectation that students can inherently understand such figures/images on their own. However, it has been observed in a variety of scientific fields that a subset of students has difficulty in understanding the representations used to explain concepts in these fields. The goal of this project is to investigate how to train students in visualization literacy, based on one class of scientific visualizations commonly used in many scientific disciplines to understand 3D space-filling figures, namely, slice or cutaway views. The project involves determining the generic characteristics of these types of visualizations, understanding the underlying strategies that need to be acquired to solve problems involving these figures, and creating a structured training program to teach students how to solve problems involving these visualizations. To evaluate how well the generic training facilitates the acquisition of a specific discipline-based scientific visualization, the training will then be introduced and tested in an introductory level geology course. Geology is a natural test-bed choice, as it attracts a diverse representation of students, and it already utilizes many 3D visualizations, for example, to understand subsurface geology. However, the results of this research can be used to train students in all fields utilizing space-filling visualization."
0.2,"There is large and expanding array of problems in fundamental physics (ranging from sub-nuclear structure of matter through astrophysics and cosmology) which deal with systems whose theoretical description involves continuously many variables with strong interconnection between them. Quantum field theory is a unifying mathematical language for such systems. Appropriately, this language is difficult, and in general its ""grammatical rules"" are not even yet established. In this situation, any instances, or ""models"", of quantum field theory whose equations can be worked out all the way through are especially valuable. Such models are known as ""integrable quantum field theories"". Mainly, they serve as the testing ground for verification and development of ideas and mathematical methods, but remarkably many integrable ""models"" directly apply to theoretical understanding of properties of complex materials. That is why today the integrable quantum field theories constitute one of the most important and actively developed area of mathematical physics. Moreover, since the discovery of ""gauge/string duality"" and the role of integrability in this relation, this field of research has found itself at the cutting edge of theoretical high-energy physics. Unfortunately, the integrable models emerging in this context still resist full solution. This research project proposes further development of integrable quantum field theories, with emphasis on the so-called integrable sigma models. This is exactly the general class of models which emerge in the context of the gauge/string duality. Also, similar models are believed to provide theoretical understanding of particularly complicated disordered systems in physics of materials. It is proposed to develop a certain new class of integrable sigma-models, with novel mathematical structure, and find full solutions. This is an intermediate step in the approach to the systems of direct application in the gauge/string dualities. Interestingly, mathematical methods developed for integrable quantum field theories turn out to have broader significance in mathematical physics, and often help to investigate a wider class of non-integrable systems. This area will be explored as well.<br/><br/>The activity consists of three projects. (1) Analysis of a new class of integrable sigma models whose target spaces are deformed group manifolds. With the most general known deformations, quantum integrability of such models require significant modifications of standard tools such as the Lax representations, the Yang-Baxter algebras, and Baxter's Q operators and their relations. The project's goal is to develop all such modifications, and use that as the basis for finding full solutions. The key to our approach will be the so-called ODE/IQFT correspondence, the new mathematical tool of integrable quantum field theories (""IQFT side"") which allows to ""encode"" its algebraic structures into a system of ordinary differential equations (""ODE"" side). This project lays in the mainstream of the current research in mathematical physics; its significance is in the relation to the gauge/string dualities, and possibly to physics of disordered systems. The other two parts the research is to explore applications of the methods of integrability in non-integrable systems. (2) The relation between the 't Hooft's equation in 1+1 QCD and the Baxter's T-Q equation will be used to analyze the meson decays and scattering amplitudes in the large-N expansion, with the ultimate goal of gaining universal tools for analysis of decays and amplitudes in generic 1+1 systems with confining interactions, which are very common in condensed matter physics. (3) The third part addresses possibility of emergence of near-integrable subsystems in otherwise non-integrable quantum field theories, the possibility which was not previously explored."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds.

0.48,"This grant is supported jointly by the Divisions of Materials Research, Physics and Mathematical Sciences. The aim of this research is a better understanding of the properties of macroscopic systems originating in the collective behavior of their microscopic constituents. The emphasis is on non-equilibrium systems and the methods used range from rigorous mathematical analysis to computer simulations. We are particularly interested in bridging the gap between rigorous results and applications.<br/>Intellectual Merit includes: 1) An extension of Boltzmann's entropy and H-theorem to systems not in local thermal equilibrium. It is proposed to generalize recent work for dense fluids to more complex systems, including nano and biological ones, where entropic considerations play an important role. This will require an appropriate generalization of Boltzmann's entropy to non-equilibrium quantum systems.<br/>2) Recently-obtained exact large deviation functions, describing fluctuations in stationary<br/>non-equilibrium states of model systems are of an unexpected form. Their most striking feature, non-locality on the macroscopic scale, can be traced to the long-range correlations, measurable experimentally by neutron scattering, which exist in such systems. Extension and application of these results to more realistic systems is planned.<br/>3) For open quantum systems, such as current-carrying nano-wires, the classical modeling of the reservoirs by stochastic interactions is problematic. The usual approach is to use free fields, or ideal gases, as reservoirs. This is unsatisfactory in many cases and we plan to continue our investigation of alternative approaches such as the use of strongly coupled systems, represented by random matrices, as reservoirs.<br/>4) Techniques we developed for dealing with the response of quantum systems to strong time dependent external fields have yielded rigorous results about simple model systems. Applications to the optimal control of quantum transitions in molecules and to external fields in solids are planned. 5) We have obtained novel results about the structure of systems with reduced particle number fluctuations. These have applications to cosmology and to queuing theory, which will be explored further. 6) An important question in developing approximation schemes for fluids is the possibility of constructing particle distributions having specified densities and pair correlations. This can be achieved in some cases by the explicit construction of point processes via determinants and renewals. General existence criteria are being investigated. 7) We have applied statistical mechanical methods to the mathematical study of epidemics taking into account correlations as well as saturation effects on networks. New macroscopic equations for the description of the evolution and prevalence of an endemic infected state improve agreement with more detailed microscopic models. Extension of these techniques to models of population dynamics and ecology is planned.<br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, mathematicians, chemists and those working in theoretical areas of the biological and social sciences. The expected applications are in material science, complex fluids and biological and social systems.

Graduate students, postdocs and minority scientists are encouraged to present talks on their work and interact with leaders in the field. The conferences also serve as a clearing house for positions and often lead to new collaborations."
0.0225,"9626428 Cranston ABSTRACT The principal investigator attacks several problems in the general area of Stochastic Analysis. One problem is to come up with a coupling for diffusions with degenerate generators given by sums of squares of vector which satisfy Hormander's hypoellipticity condition. A related problem is to give a coupling proof of Moser's Harnack inequality. The principal investigator also uses coupling techniques on Brownian motion on Gromov hyperbolic spaces to estimate eigenvalues and gradients of harmonic functions. The principal investigator also studies relativistic Brownian motion. Finally, the investigator is deriving more results on the behavior of processes with dependence on the past. The work in the current proposal falls into the general area of Stochastic Analysis. This means the analysis of randomly evolving phenomena. The portions of this proposal on coupling are related to the smoothness of temperature distributions on surfaces, their rate of convergence to a steady state and the dependence of these on the geometry of the surface. The problems on processes whose behavior depends on the past have potential applications to economics (prices e.g.) and to biology (chemotactic phenomena.) The work on relativistic Brownian motion can have potential applications to cosmology, especially in deciding whether it is possible to observe black holes."

0.222092,"Weak gravitational lensing - the subtle distortion of the images of background galaxies caused by the bending of light by intervening mass - is one of the most potentially powerful probes of dark energy. But measurement and interpretation of the lensing signal is complicated by intrinsic correlations between the alignments of galaxy images. Intrinsic correlations can arise when physically close galaxies are aligned by the gravitational field of the matter surrounding them, or when a matter structure links the orientation of a galaxy close to it to the lensed image of a galaxy far behind. Previous studies have shown that if intrinsic alignments are ignored, the lensing constraints on the dark energy equation of state are biased by up to 50%. This project will study the 3-point intrinsic correlations of alignments and how their effects can be removed from the lensing signal. The Principal Investigator, collaborator, and graduate student supported by the project will carry out analytical calculations and numerical integrations to develop the method of ""self-calibration,"" which uses additional correlations that can all be extracted from the same lensing survey to calculate the intrinsic alignment contamination and remove it. They will derive statistical estimators of the 3-point correlations and study their dependencies on redshift, luminosity, color, and morphology in order to understand their scaling properties. The work will have broad impact in cosmology, in developing an essential correction to lensing surveys. It will also contribute to graduate education and to the development research program at the Principal Investigator's institution. The Principal Investigator will also be involved in outreach to local amateur astronomy groups and through participation in public presentations and professional development programs for teachers."
0.357994,"Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS 1211652, Principal Investigator: Xiuxiong Chen<br/><br/>The famous Calabi conjecture states that every Kaehler manifold whose first Chern class has a definite sign will always have a Kaehler Einstein metric with appropriate sign on its scalar curvature. This famous conjecture was proved by S. T. Yau in 1976 when the first Chern class vanishes, and independently by Yau and Aubin for the case when the first Chern class is negative. When the first Chern class is positive, the corresponding Calabi conjecture is only solved in dimension 2, by G. Tian in 1989. The higher dimensional case is largely open till this day. There are substantial and major progress made in this important area of mathematics in recent years. We propose to study a network of problems centered around the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics (a cousin of Kaehler Einstein metrics), stability of the underlying polarized Kaehler manifolds, and other related areas . The principal investigator believes that we will see more breakthrough in near future.<br/><br/>The problem of the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics is the key problem in differential geometry. It has strong impact to other fields of sciences, in particular, physics. According to A. Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of space-time. Thus the research in Kaehler geometry is crucially important in physics and cosmology. The research proposed also has impact in string theory, in algebraic geometry as well as nonlinear analysis. Progress in this proposed problems will be highly interesting to many different fields."
0.27478,"AST-0707725<br/>Eisenstein<br/><br/>This project will use a specially-targeted sample of luminous early-type galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to probe the large-scale correlations of galaxies with unprecedented accuracy. This will refine existing measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the matter density of the Universe. Sound waves that propagate in the first million years after the Big Bang imprint distinctive features into the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the clustering of matter today. These BAO create a sharp feature in the correlation of galaxies whose scale can be combined with information from CMB anisotropy data to place strong constraints on the curvature of the Universe and on dark energy. The SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample is the best dataset by a wide margin for studying the BAO and other aspects of large-scale structure. Coupling these data with new theoretical insights should lead to significant improvements, perhaps halving the error bars on earlier results.<br/><br/>The acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is one of the central problems in modern cosmology and poses a deep challenge to physics. Both the observational and the theoretical parts of this work will have a direct impact on the design of future galaxy redshift surveys, and on the portfolio of dark energy experiments. The principal investigator will also continue to engage several students, both graduate and undergraduate, in this research."
0.353181,"As a branch of Mathematics, Differential Geometry studies the shapes of spaces through distances and angles. The key concept involved is that of a so-called curvature, the simplest kind being the scalar curvature function on a space. The extremal cases are often the most interesting to study. In particular, the existence of a constant scalar curvature metric is of a major importance in Differential Geometry. It has a strong impact on other fields of sciences such as physics. For instance, the work of Calabi-Yau directly provided a mathematical foundation in mirror symmetry. According to A. Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of the space-time. Therefore, the research in complex geometry is crucially important in physics and cosmology. The research proposed here also has impacts on algebraic geometry and partial differential equations. The project has an integrated education component which will enable the PI to continue supporting graduate students financially to pursue their research. <br/><br/>In recent years, striking progress has been made in Kaehler geometry, particularly on the existence of the Kaehler-Einstein metrics and the limiting behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci flow solution, both in Fano manifolds. More exciting progress will follow after these works in this and adjacent area. In Kaehler geometry, the focus of the field is now on the existence of constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics which is more general and harder than the existence of the Kaehler-Einstein metrics. This program on constant scalar curvature Kaehler metrics, which was first proposed by E. Calabi in 1950s, amounts to solving a 4th-order partial differential equation which naturally interacts with metric geometry as well as algebraic geometry. In this project, the PI will study a network of problems centering around the existence of constant scalar curvature metrics and other related areas. These include some fundamental problems in complex Monger-Ampere equations, a priori estimates for constant scalar curvature metrics, metric geometry as well as geometric flow (the Calabi flow and the Kaehler-Ricci flow)."
0.085238,"A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes. Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (BHs) at the centers of massive galaxies. These BHs light up as quasars during the relatively brief phases when the BHs accumulate most of their mass through accretion. Over the past half-century, considerable effort has been devoted to capturing these accretion spurts through surveys at optical wavelengths. In general, these surveys have been limited to the most luminous sources, or small numbers within deep fields; however, quasar observations are undergoing an exponential leap in depth and breadth enabled by new and upcoming surveys. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III/BOSS) final data release will include about 160,000 quasars at redshifts around 2--3, and its successor, the SDSS-IV/eBOSS, will obtain spectra of over 600,000 quasars at redshifts around 1--2. The investigators will complement the quasar samples from these cosmology surveys with their own high redshift programs to form a complete picture of the evolution of faint quasars from optical surveys. <br/><br/>The investigators will integrate the science program into a tiered outreach program at Pima Community College, a Hispanic-Serving Institution located in Tucson. The outreach program includes (1) public lectures at the East Campus, a region not reached by The University of Arizona programs, (2) lectures to Astronomy 101 students at Pima integrating an overview of Active Galactic Nuclei into the regular curriculum, and (3) engagement of a small number of Pima students in the research program itself by teaching the basics of quasar spectroscopy and including the students in the eBOSS program to visually inspect quasar spectra.<br/><br/>More technically, exploring this method in the regime of sparse data (an important precursor for LSST), the team will utilize Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) reductions of SDSS imaging data to identify about 400 quasars at redshifts around z = 4 through variability selection. Finally, the team will use deep CFHT imaging to reach faint quasars (i_AB = 24) at redshift around z = 5. Together, these data will probe several magnitudes below the break luminosity over a wide redshift range and will reach nearly all objects classifiable as quasars over 5 Gyr of cosmic evolution, including the crucial epoch when both star formation and quasar activity peak.<br/><br/>Leveraging massive spectroscopic surveys as well as separate observations with large telescopes, the team will complete the census of the faint end of the quasar luminosity function to redshift around z = 5 and obtain new measurements of high-z clustering, thereby providing strong constraints for models of quasar lifetimes and feedback physics. These measurements will also provide strong constraints on the quasar ionizing background during the epoch of He II reionization. Finally, a key aspect of the project is to develop tools needed for an era when quasar surveys will be dominated by systematics rather than by statistics. The team will accomplish this by building models for quasar properties constrained by existing observations but which provide useful projections for future surveys. These models will be used to guide target selection for spectroscopic efforts, identify quasars from photometric data, and train photometric redshift estimation; furthermore, they will provide insight into intrinsic quasar properties, such as continuum and dust extinction."

Professor Meade plans to participate in the MARIACHI program, an existing program for high school students that provides research opportunities in high energy/astroparticle physics through cosmic ray research. He will also participate in the ""adopt-a-physicist"" program designed to share the experiences of active physicists with high school students, to promote the benefits of studying physics.

0.45,"There have been recent advances in understanding various ways of imbedding our universe in the 10 dimensional space where a consistent unified theory of particles which have extension (rather than being point-like) exists. The time is thus now ripe for bringing systematic methods to bear on the construction and analysis of compactifications of string theory as models of realistic particle physics. The String Vacuum Project aims to pursue a systematic study of the space of string compactifications leading to four-dimensional physics. The PIs will accomplish this with a two pronged approach. Using a bottom-up strategy the members of the collaboration will search for patches of string vacua which are as close as possible to low energy, phenomenologically acceptable theories. These can hopefully be tested at the Large Hadron Collider . On the other hand, using a top-down strategy the collaboration will pursue a general search of the string landscape of vacua in search of more general correlations. In order to accomplish their goals the PIs are proposing a String Vacuum Project (SVP) network with eight geographic nodes. They are asking for funds to support students who will work in the proposed area and funds to support travel to bi-annual network workshops. This project has many broader implications. The explicit work on interpreting LHC data and on approaches to finding a theory underlying the signals will help realize the full potential of LHC, a project strongly supported by U.S. physics goals. This project is strongly interdisciplinary, involving particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, string theory, mathematics, and information frontier analysis. The results will be disseminated via publication at all possible levels. There will be significant training of graduate students and postdocs, and the project will involve female and minority scientists to provide role model. The Pis anticipate that the results of this project will stimulate significant public interest, and they will systematically communicate results through public talks and articles."
0.349855,"The distinctions drawn between scientific and artistic endeavors have a long, historical trajectory, punctuated by a series of debates on the relative merits of each. T he apparent consensus regarding the impermeability of their categorical boundaries has two roots. The first was the scientific revolution of the Renaissance, predicated in large part upon the rise of Copernican cosmology, empiricism, and the systematic development of modern mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry. The second was the gradual institutionalization of disciplinary divisions in the faculties of the modern university, which in the 19th century culminated in the segregation of the European educational system between classical studies and scientific and technical training. Despite the legacy of a modern-day institutional compartmentalization that seeks to distance the arts (and the humanities of which they are a part) from the natural sciences, they revolve within a shared history characterized as much by negotiation, mutual learning, and symbiosis as by pronouncements of fundamental difference. The recognition of this shared history as well as a desire to draw upon it as both intellectual resource and source material helps drive the emergence of what has been termed the ""new Leonardos"" and ""Renaissance teams,"" a loosely held movement that thrives upon the collaboration between artists and scientists. The participants in these collaborations have forged new intellectual pathways, often articulating areas of study that combine insights from the sciences and humanities. This international collaborative research project will explore the institutional, political, epistemic, and technological matrices that both allow for these interfaces to emerge and that shape their development and wider impact. The investigators will conduct a multi-sited study of contemporary collaborative projects involving diverse groups of scientists and artists in the United States and the United Kingdom. Major questions that the investigators address include: What sorts of resources (material, financial, and regulatory) are marshaled for the collaborations? How and why do artists engage with and reinterpret a range of scientific practices? Why are scientists interested in artistic representations of their work? What new forms of public access are created when scientists open their laboratories to artists? How do such collaborations tackle the ethical and political dimensions of complex problems? How do these collaborations allow for a shift to occur regarding how participants and their various audiences understand the content and purpose of art and science as well as their place within society? In pursuing these questions, the investigators will employ participant observation, interviews, focus groups, surveys, and visual interpretative methods in order to generate detailed descriptions and analyses of the day-to-day activities and products of five sites of art-science collaboration. In addition to previously used approaches, the investigators will focus particular attention on geographic aspects of the interactions among scientists and artists in order to recognize the spatial situatedness of people, things and the relations that bind and transform them.<br/><br/>The project will make a substantial contribution toward understanding how ""lessons learned"" can be transposed into other contexts, thereby developing and realizing models for public outreach at different sites. Because the examination of science-art collaborations often entails the advancement of public knowledge about a number of contemporary world-wide crises and discoveries, the project will serve as a study of the development of innovative strategies for the delivery of popular education and knowledge transfer devoted to timely, policy-related issues of the larger public interest. The project will aid in the mapping of a broad network of emerging resources for further collaborations across the humanities and social and physical sciences, making it a resource for researchers and funding agencies seeking to develop new directions in research collaboration. The project also has the potential to have a transformative impact upon funding agencies. As interdisciplinary, collaborative projects, funded by both public and private foundations and occurring both inside and outside the bounds of the academy become more widespread, projects like this one can help provide a model for investigation and a baseline for assessing their effects and effectiveness."

0.300966,"This award supports a novel experiment designed to measure the absolute mass scale of the electron neutrino. Though the existence of neutrino mass is now firmly established experimentally, the mass scale itself remains unknown. The new technique supported by this award relies on the detection and measurement of coherent radiation created from the cyclotron motion of electrons in strong magnetic fields. Since the frequency of the emitted cyclotron radiation depends inversely on the particle's Lorentz boost, detection and measurement of the coherent radiation is tantamount to measuring the kinetic energy of the electron. One immediate application of this new technique is in the measurement of the endpoint spectrum from tritium beta decay, which is directly sensitive to the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Knowledge of neutrino masses has a broad impact to the scientific community, particularly in the fields of nuclear and particle physics, as well as cosmology. The broad appeal and novelty of this technique are expected to engage undergraduate students.

0.4,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>The research projects covers several research projects in which very low energy neutrons are used to strengthen our understanding of fundamental interactions. In the first project, several observables in neutron beta decay are studied; the combination of these observables with another experimental result (the determination of the neutron lifetime) determines the coupling constants of the weak interaction which causes the neutron decay. They are used as a sensitive test of the validity of the present theory which describes weak interaction coupling nucleons to leptons (the electrons and neutrinos produced in neutron decay). A related process is the weak coupling between nucleons and other nucleons, and the second project, a measurement of the asymmetry in the direction of gamma ray emission relative to the polarization of a neutron in the neutron capture on protons, is performed to determine the strength the dominant process of the weak interaction between nucleons. The third project is the characterization of gravitationally bound quantum states of ultracold neutron in the gravitational field over a glass mirror. A series of experiments is used to search for new short range interactions which would influence these quantum states. Finally, a purifier will be built for Helium-4 which is used as a production target for ultracold neutrons in a search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron.

0.671433,"The neutrino is the lightest known elementary particle. It has no electric charge but has an intrinsic angular-momentum(or spin) of one half unit of Planck's constant just like it's cousin the electron. Discovered in 1957 by Reines and Cowan, it remains one of the least understood particles in the elementary zoo. According to conventional wisdom, in modern cosmology the universe is densely populated with neutrinos. Accordingly,if they would have a large enough mass, they could have played an important role in the evolution of the universe in it's early stages and even at present. Approximately 90% of the mass of the universe has not been identified. In 1998 it was announced that<br/>neutrinos resulting from the decay of cosmic-ray muons in the atmosphere were found to oscillate between different families. This would require that they do have some mass but such experiments do not yield how much. The rate of the hypothesized rare radioactive decay called double-beta decay can yield this very valuable information when combined with the neutrino oscillation results. The interesting version of this phenomenon would result if a nucleus would decay by emitting two electrons and nothing else. An important conservation law would be violated by such a process unless two anti-neutrinos were also emitted with the electrons. Since the electrons are leptons and the anti-neutrinos are anti-leptons the total number of leptons is conserved in the the decay with anti-neutrinos. For the decay to occur without anti-neutrinos, neutrinos in general must have mass and an important symmetry in physics must be violated. The Majorana and CUORE experiments, which are the subjects of this proposal, are next generation no-neutrino double-beta decay experiments with an improvement in the sensitivity to neutrino mass that is predicted to be about one hundred times better than the best experiments done to date.<br/>Considering all the data available, they have a significant probability<br/>for discovery, for being able to provide important information on the<br/>mass of neutrinos as well as to determine if neutrinos are there own<br/>anti-particles. CUORICINO is a smaller first step towards building the<br/>full version of CUORE."

A principal finding of the APS Multidivisional Study stated: ""We recommend, as a high priority, a phased program of sensitive searches for neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay."" The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that the observation of such a decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton number conservation, an important symmetry in elementary-particle physics. In fact, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, a measurement of the decay half-life would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. This result, combined with neutrino oscillation data, would determine all three neutrino-mass eigenvalues. Is leptogenesis even a possibility? Yes, but only if neutrinos are Majorana particles. <br/><br/>These funds are awarded to assist the Majorana Demonstrator (MJD) experiment searching for neutrino-less double beta decay in germanium -76 (Ge-76).

The principal investigator will work towards such a classification and to determine whether certain particular equations arising in applications have this property.<br/><br/>Over the last ten years, after a quiet period of many decades, an enormous amount of literature has appeared on the Painleve equations and their generalizations, due to a great number of interdisciplinary connections and applications that have been found. On the theoretical side, the Painleve property is related to the concept of integrability for non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations.

0.1309,"The research is aimed at determining the distribution, motions and physical conditions of the various components of the interstellar medium in galaxies. The purpose is to study the relationship of these components to each other, to the spiral structure, and to the star formation processes in galaxies. While the general evolutionary cycle between the interstellar medium and the stars in galaxies is understood, the detailed underlying processes are still not clearly delineated. In order to study the interstellar medium in external galaxies with sufficient resolution, the Principal Investigators will use the relatively new Hat Creek millimeter-wavelength telescope to observe the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) component and the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope to observe the molecular component and the relativistic electrons. An optical imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometer will be used to probe the ionized gas. Such comparative detailed analyses will further the understanding of the basic processes of galactic evolution. How galaxies evolve with time has relevance to many basic questions in astronomy such as galaxy formation, cosmology, and the origin of the structure of galaxies and of their morphological types."
0.177666,"The motivating idea of this project is that functions have a hitherto unknown probabilistic structure: associated with certain combinations of first-order partial derivatives of functions, there are two fields of rotations, and two martingales that are martingale transforms of each other, starting from constants of equal modulus, and ending at what one obtains after rotating these combinations of the derivatives. Finding such rotation fields would, in combination with techniques developed by Burkholder for martingale transforms, enable one to obtain the conjectured values for the sharp norms of certain singular integral operators that occupy a central place in complex and harmonic analysis: the Beurling-Ahlfors transformation in the plane and its generalizations in space. The principal investigator will work on extending to the general case his previous results showing that in certain cases such rotations and martingales exist. The principal investigator will also study the order of growth of the solutions to the second and fourth Painleve equations. The six Painleve differential equations are prototypes of second-order differential equations that do not have removable singularities. They have recently had an increasing impact in pure and applied mathematics and in science and engineering. <br/><br/>Work performed under this proposal should lead to the development of new structures tying together analysis, probability theory, and physics: the principal investigator has found that, in three dimensions, the martingale conjecture has an interesting physical interpretation as a relation between static electric and magnetic fields. It will also lead to a greater understanding of and concrete results for the important Painleve class of nonlinear differential equations, which is being used in numerous applications in other areas of mathematics as well as in physics and engineering. Painleve equations are considered to be related to the concept of integrability for nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations. Other applications in pure mathematics include the study of Bonnet surfaces and random matrices. In interdisciplinary mathematics and other sciences, the numerous applications of the Painleve equations and transcendents include the following areas: the Ising model in physics; correlation functions in an antiferromagnet model; quantum field theory and topological field theory; general relativity and cosmology; supersymmetry gauge theories in physics; resonant oscillations in shallow water; Hele-Shaw problems in viscous fluids; plasma physics; superconductivity; nonlinear optics and fiber optics; polymers, polyelectrolytes, and colloids."

0.01,"Workshop on Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Grid Methods, being held March 12-13, 1997 at the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (SAMR) methods are playing an increasing role in tackling difficult scientific applications, including compressible flows, cosmology, and electronic structures arising in local spin density calculations. Providing adequate software support for SAMR codes is challenging even on sequential implementations. In parallel implementations, program complexity increases qualitatively due to computation and communication requirements that are dynamic, data-dependent, and irregular. The rapid evolution in target parallel systems only further complicates design decisions. A workshop is proposed that will bring together experts in applications, numerical methods, and software development from academia, national labs, and industry. The goal of the workshop is to identify common ground in the application and implementation of SAMR, as well as issues requiring specialization. The specific objectives of the workshop are : (i) to improve the general understanding of the application of SAMR to practical problems, (ii) to identify issues critical to efficient and effective implementation on high performance computers, (iii) to stimulate the development of a community code repository for software including benchmarks to assist in the evaluation of software and compiler technologies. The proceedings of the workshop will be published by Springer-Verlag as part of the IMA (Institute for Mathematical and its Applications) Book Series."

1.820663,"This is an exciting time in our quest to understand neutrinos -- fundamental particles that play key roles in the early universe, in cosmology and astrophysics, and in nuclear and particle physics. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. With the realization that neutrinos are massive, there is an increased interest in investigating their intrinsic properties. Understanding the neutrino mass generation mechanism, the neutrino character (Majorana or Dirac), the absolute neutrino mass scale, and the neutrino mass spectrum are some of the main focuses of the immediate future's neutrino experiments. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for the neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. With the goal of ultimately realizing a 1-tonne scale neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay experiment using Germanium (Ge) detectors, the Majorana collaboration is assembling a prototype referred to as the Demonstrator that is intended to confirm that background levels low enough to justify such a large experiment can be reached. The baseline plan for the Demonstrator is for 15 kg of Ge detectors fabricated from Ge enriched in the double-beta isotope 76-Ge. Because most of the cost of such an experiment is the apparatus associated with it and not enriched Ge, and because one can increase the mass of instrumented 76-Ge significantly without increasing that base cost, there is the opportunity to ""increase"" the physics reach of the project for a reasonable, incremental additional cost. This award provides support for extra Ge detectors fabricated from enriched material to improve the physics reach.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technology of larger, lower-background HPGe arrays developed from a tonne-scale experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: direct dark matter searches; measurements for environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities. An E&O program with the Morehead Planetarium on the campus of U. of North Carolina will bring underground science to the public."

The subjects of General Relativity and Gravitation have assumed increasing importance in the past decade or so. Ties to High-Energy Particle Physics arise from studies of cosmology and of the early moments in the formation of the universe. New astronomical observations and astrophysical studies make the existence of extremely massive black holes in active galactic nuclei seem very likely. Evidence for black holes in other objects and for the importance of relativistic effects in many astronomical events such as the emission of jets from radio galaxies also exists. Observation of the binary pulsar and of distances to the moon and other planets have permitted very accurate tests of gravitational theory.

0.119696,"Proposal # DMS-9731097 PI: Harvey Segur Title: Nonlinear Wave Motion The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation in two spatial dimensions plus time. It is one of very few nonlinear equations that: (i) is completely integrable and admits ""soliton"" solutions; (ii) involves two spatial dimensions plus time; and (iii) arises naturally in physics. Specifically, the equation describes approximately the motion of ocean waves in shallow water. (Ocean waves require two spatial dimensions because they occur on the water's two-dimensional surface.) For this application, the most interesting solutions are either exactly or approximately periodic, just as typical ocean waves are approximately periodic. Based on recent discoveries of the mathematical structure of this equation, we can now solve this problem as an initial-value problem for initial data that are either exactly or approximately periodic in space. The work to be carried out in this study will exploit this structure to build an accurate model of waves in shallow water. The waves in the model will be as complicated as waves in the ocean usually are: steady or unsteady, with either exact or approximate periodicity in time or in space or both, with arbitrarily large amplitudes, and with fully two-dimensional spatial patterns. No other functioning model of water waves includes all of these features simultaneously, so this model should vastly improve our ability to predict waves in shallow water. Nonlinear phenomena occur when a perturbation to a system triggers a response that is not proportional to the perturbation. Many of the dramatic events in nature are nonlinear, including the ""big bang"" in cosmology, sonic booms in aerodynamics, hurricanes and breaking ocean waves in geophysics. The mathematical models used to describe these phenomena are intrinsically nonlinear, and typically we cannot solve them in any general sense. The set of models that admit ""solitons"" and are ""completely integrable"" are exceptions to this rule: usually these models can be solved in complete detail, and they have provided great insight into the nature of nonlinear wave phenomena. The work to be carried out in this study will exploit recently a discovered mathematical structure of one of these completely integrable models to build an accurate and realistic model of ocean waves in shallow water. Practical implications of more accurate predictions of shallow water waves include better control of beach erosion, fewer problems with shoreline pollution from dispersal of man-made waste, and better design of offshore structures like oil platforms."

0.169045,"Hamilton's major accomplishment, as part of his doctoral thesis, was to show the consistency of the model of a type I supernova, exploding from an accreting white dwarf, with the observed x-rays of the supernova remnant, caused by a shock moving into a plasma consisting of heavy elements rather than hydrogen. His planned studies include both supernovae and galaxy clustering, radiation processes and hydrodynamics. Hamilton is a promising young theoretician working on supernovae and the clustering of galaxies. Supernovae are the most energetic explosions of stars, thought to create the elements of which the Earth is composed. The blast wave from the explosion causes x-rays observed by satellites. Hamilton produced the first detailed explanation of the x-rays from one major kind of supernova remnant, substantiating thereby the models for the supernova and for its production of the elements. Hamilton is also interested in problems of cosmology, specifically the manner in which galaxies are clumped in space. He is an expert on both radiation processes and hydrodynamics."
0.163711,"A broad range of observations tell us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that were produced moments after the Big Bang. Such particles would represent an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as supersymmetry or additional dimensions. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low-temperature phonon-mediated devices to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish these events from other background interactions. One of many key technological requirements for the scaling to greater mass of the low-temperature germanium technology is improvement in the cryogenic preamplifiers of both phonon and ionization signals. The superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) preamplifiers used in the present Soudan facility were produced and evaluated through the efforts of this group several years ago, and the group has been an integral member of the collaboration in optimizing their performance throughout the operation of the various CDMS experiments at Soudan. <br/><br/>This award will support the scientific aspects of the CDMS programs in four complementary directions, fully coordinated within the collaboration: (a) support of the SuperCDMS-Soudan experiment (participating in operation of the Soudan experiment, particularly oversight and maintenance of the phonon readout system), (b) contribution to the design of SuperCDMS-SNOLAB (design optimization of cold hardware and electronics), (c) scientific support to SuperCDMS-SNOLAB construction (production testing of SuperCDMS-SNOLAB SQUIDs and room-temperature electronics), and (d) long-term R&D towards GEODM (SQUID-based ionization readout).

0.959,"Very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics has been transformed by a number of stunning discoveries made by the current-generation, ground-based gamma-ray observatories operating in the 100 GeV - 10 TeV energy range. These observatories are arrays of 2-4 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) that detect VHE gamma-rays via Cherenkov light from secondary electrons in electromagnetic cascades initiated by gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Developing new instruments with significantly better sensitivity is not possible by a simple replication or upgrade of existing devices. <br/><br/>With this award, the proponents will build a novel gamma-ray telescope that has the potential to transform the field, based on work by Schwarzschild and Couder. It incorporates original ideas for the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve substantial gains in angular resolution and field of view at costs comparable to existing instruments. The international Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is preparing for a future IACT array with ten times better sensitivity and broader energy coverage to exploit the evident scientific potential of VHE gamma-ray observations. Some examples of new types of gamma-ray discoveries are searching extremely deeply for dark matter in the Galactic center and halo, testing cosmology with extragalactic background light measurements, resolving the details of shock acceleration in supernova remnants and pulsar winds, and advancing the physics of extragalactic jets by population studies and observations of short-term variability.<br/><br/>This new telescope overcomes the fundamental limitations in angular resolution and field of view of current prime-focus IACTs. At the same time, it allows the application of new, lower-cost technologies for the camera focal plane sensors. This work will demonstrate the enhanced performance and improved reliability of the SCT design, and the location adjacent to VERITAS will allow the performance to be evaluated against an instrument of known sensitivity. The results from this effort will enable informed choices to be made for the construction of CTA or other future instruments. It will also enhance the capabilities of the VERITAS Observatory.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Working with industry, this work will foster emerging technologies for the mass production of relatively inexpensive, light, aspheric mirror segments that will both enable future instruments to deliver unique science capabilities and encourage use of the design in the other fields of astronomy. This project will provide a unique opportunity for integrated research and education for a substantial number of young scientists."

0.233954,"Exploration of the time domain - discovery and studies of objects and phenomena changing on time scales ranging from seconds to years - is now one of the most vibrant and rapidly developing fields of astronomy, touching on a broad and diverse spectrum of research areas, from the Solar system and discoveries of exoplanets to the distant quasars, and from stellar astrophysics to cosmology and extreme relativistic astrophysics. Time domain information is essential for understanding of some of the most interesting phenomena we observe; for example, we could not learn anything from a single picture of a Supernova, or a single snapshot of a gamma-ray burst; variability of stars aids to our understanding of their structure and evolution; motions of stars tell us about the structure of our Galaxy. We now study the universe and its major constituents as a dynamical, and always changing system. This change was enabled by the progress in information technology. For many years now, large digital sky surveys have been the main sources of data in astronomy. While they can be seen as panoramic cosmic photography, we are now moving into a panoramic cosmic cinematography, with a corresponding increase in information volumes and quality: digital synoptic sky surveys which cover the sky many times, detecting objects and phenomena which change or move. This trend will culminate in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) years from now, but we are already exploring the science and technology of time-domain astronomy with precursor surveys. They already have a significant potential for discovery, and will help us sharpen our questions and strategies for the larger surveys in the future.<br/>This project is a continuation and substantial expansion of the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), an ongoing, productive synoptic sky survey that is producing a steady stream of astronomical transient events, and making them immediately available to the entire community; it is the only current sky survey that does so. It utilizes a data stream obtained in a search for near-Earth and planetary hazard asteroids, funded by NASA, and it leverages considerable existing investments in software and data services. We have established an extensive web of collaborations for the follow-up observations and data analysis. These substantial external resources come at no cost to the NSF, and provide for much greater scientific returns on investment than what could be done with a fully funded, new survey.<br/><br/>The overall scientific goal of CRTS is a systematic exploration of the faint, variable sky. CRTS has so far discovered ~6,500 distinct transient events, and > 13 million variable sources, including a wide variety of variable stars, active galactic nuclei, various cosmic explosions, stellar flares, etc. For at least 2 years in a row, CRTS has published more Supernovae (SNe) than any other survey, including the most luminous SNe ever seen, long-predicted SNe from AGN accretion disks, hundreds of dwarf novae and other interesting cataclysmic variables, planets around white dwarfs, new counterparts of x-ray sources, new tidal streams in the Galactic halo, etc. In addition to a plenty of known types of objects and phenomena, there is a real possibility of a discovery of previously unknown kinds. This project will continue these studies, and start a number of new ones, that touch on a variety of open astronomical challenges. The unique open data policy of CRTS enables the entire astronomical community to partake in these discoveries. All transient events are published electronically in real time, and all data (images, catalogs, etc.) are also made publicly available; they will enable a broad range of archival science. CRTS may be a showcase for the data sharing and re-use, that must become a standard practice in the 21st century.<br/><br/>This project will aid the entire astronomical community in making new discoveries and developing new scientific strategies. It is an example of a new generation of scientific experiments involving real-time mining of massive data streams, and dynamical follow-up strategies. We train undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, the future science and technology leaders, and develop a broad variety of educational and public outreach materials, both for the new science and computation."
0.249999,"AST 0098676<br/>Kulkarni<br/><br/>Cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most spectacular, known phenomena in the universe. They consist of short outbursts (fractions of seconds to a few minutes) of high-energy radiation originating in distant regions of the universe, There are a few such outbursts observed per day. These were first observed by the US Vela satellites in the early 1960's. They have remained one of the major mysteries of astrophysics for the past 30 years. <br/><br/>In the late 1990's breakthrough discoveries found that the bursts originated in faint galaxies, at typical distances of several billion light years. Measurements of distances to the bursts, using large, ground-based telescopes, revealed that apparently some of them emit prodigious amounts of energy; larger than the total amount of energy produced by our Sun over its entire projected lifespan of about 10 billion years, but compressed into a few seconds! While theories abound, the ultimate cause of these amazing cosmic explosions remains unknown. However, it now seems likely that at least some bursts represent ""birth cries"" of black holes, produced in the explosion of massive stars (""hypernovas""). Current research suggests that the GRB phenomenon is closely related to the history of star formation in the universe, and that it can be used as a novel probe of early cosmic evolution. It is also likely that most GRBs produce highly collimated jets of very energetic particles and radiation, effectively becoming giant accelerators<br/>in the sky. While a lot has been learned over the past few years, much more remains to be found about the source and the ultimate physical mechanism behind these remarkable cosmic explosions. <br/><br/>The keys to this further understanding lies in (1) detailed observations of their afterglows seen at wavelengths ranging from radio waves, through visible light and out to x-rays; (2) additional measurements of the distances to these enigmatic events; and (3) a better understanding of their environments and the distant galaxies in which they originate. This is the subject of the present<br/>project. Using the worlds largest optical/infrared telescopes (the 10-m Keck telescopes in Hawaii and the large telescopes at Mt. Palomar in California), and the world's premier radio telescopes (e.g., the Very Large Array in New Mexico) to observe GRBs when they are first identified and to continue to observe them as they decline in brightness, the goal is to construct a wide enough bank of data to permit testing and winnowing of the scores of theoretical models presently under study.

The extremely low level of anisotropy observed in the microwave background radiation has focused attention on theories of structure formation which propose that the dominant matter content of the Universe is in the form of non-baryonic matter. The questions of the dominant matter content of the Universe and the formation of structure in the Universe are fundamental and are amongst the most important questions in cosmology. Dr. Readhead and colleagues at Cal Tech will examine the anisotropy of the background radiation on angular scales from 2 to 20 arcminutes using radio wavelength telescopes at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory.

Both projects rely on Polarization Sensitive Bolometers (PSBs), a special detector technology developed at Caltech. Due to yield problems associated with the first fabrication run, the detector group was over-extended, and as a result, support for continued operation of BICEP is in doubt. The current support is for the PSBs needed to run both experiments at the same time, and is required to avoid having to divert money needed for operation of BICEP during the coming winter.<br/><br/>This work is funded from the Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology program of the Division of Astronomical Sciences, and from the Antarctic Aeronomy and Astrophysics program of the Office of Polar Programs, as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research. Support for the upcoming polar season is an urgent need by the definition of the SGER program. This work is part of the interagency Physics of the Universe program."
0.821639,"AST-0607857<br/>Pearson<br/><br/>This project will construct a new 5 GHz radio polarimeter and use it to conduct the C-Band All Sky Survey (C-BASS), a radio survey of the entire sky sensitive to total intensity and linear polarization, with minimal corruption by instrumental systematic effects. The northern part of the survey will use an existing 5.5-meter antenna at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. A parallel southern survey will be conducted through a future, differently supported, project. The 5-GHz C-BASS survey will be the first survey of diffuse Galactic emission at a frequency low enough to be dominated by synchrotron radiation but high enough to be uncorrupted by Faraday rotation effects. Its primary science goal is to improve the accuracy with which Galactic foreground signals can be removed from maps of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It will thus provide critical support for future experiments to measure that polarization, which is expected to provide key information about the epoch of inflation. The survey will also yield new results about the interstellar medium, magnetic field, and radiation mechanisms, inside the Galaxy.<br/><br/>The resultant sky maps will be made freely available soon after the completion of the northern survey, and should be very useful for future mission planning. This survey starts a collaboration between Caltech, the Universities of Oxford and Manchester in the UK, and Rhodes University in South Africa, including student exchanges. The research team will be creating teaching tools based on archives from the Nova public television series, to bring the excitement and wonder of astrophysics and cosmology into the K-12 classroom."
0.499982,"As the exponential growth of data volumes and complexity continues in all sciences (and indeed all other fields of the modern society, economy, commerce, security, etc.), there is a growing need for powerful new tools and methodologies which can help us extract knowledge and understanding from these massive data sets and data streams. The newly gained knowledge is often used to guide our actions, and in science that typically means follow-up studies and measurements, as the research cycle continues. As the data rates and volume increase, it becomes necessary to take humans out of the loop, and develop automated methods for time-critical knowledge extraction and optimized response to anomalous or interesting events found by the data processing pipelines. This proposal is to develop a system that will be an example of a new generation of scientific experiments and methods that involve real-time mining of massive data streams, and dynamical follow-up strategies. The system would be developed and validated in the context of real scientific situations from the emerging field of time-domain astronomy. A new generation of synoptic sky surveys covers the sky repeatedly, detecting variable or transient phenomena, over a broad range of astrophysics, from the Solar system and stellar evolution, to cosmology and extreme relativistic objects; from extrasolar planets to gamma-ray bursts and supernovae as probes of the dark energy. As we explore the observable parameter space, there is a real possibility of discovery of new types of objects and phenomena. <br/><br/>The system will enable exciting new astrophysics, and facilitate discovery. The key to this is a fully automated classification and prioritization of the transient events, and their follow-up observations. This poses some interesting challenges for applied computer science, especially in the area of Machine Learning, including an automated classification where only a sparse, incomplete, and heterogeneous data are available, and contextual information and domain expertise must be folded in the process. The process must be dynamic, incorporating new data as they become available, and revising the classifications accordingly. The system would then generate automatically decisions for an optimal follow-up of the most interesting events, given the available limited assets and resources. This project will aid the entire astronomical community in developing new scientific strategies and procedures in the era of large synoptic sky surveys, facilitate data sharing and re-use, and stimulate further development of Virtual Observatory capabilities. The methods and experiences gained here will be described in the open literature, so that they may find a broader use outside astronomy, wherever similar time-critical situations occur, thus fostering constructive new synergies between applied computer science and other domains. The proposers will train undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, in the methods of scientific computing and computational thinking, and develop effective EPO materials, touching on both the new science and computation.<br/><br/>The challenges posed by the knowledge extraction in the era of data abundance become even sharper in the time-critical situations where we mine the information from massive data streams, especially when the phenomena under study are short-lived, and/or a rapid follow-up reaction is needed. Potentially interesting phenomena and events must be identified, classified, and prioritized in real time, typically using some combination of the new measurements, and existing archival data and models. Then an optimal decision has to be made as to what is the best follow-up that will provide the essential new information in any given individual case; this can be critical if the follow-up assets are scarce or costly. If the time scales are short, and data rates large, the implication is that humans should be taken out of the loop, and that the classification, prioritization, and follow-up decision process must be fully automated. Machine learning (ML) and machine intelligence tools become a necessity. This proposal is to develop a novel, ML-based system for a real-time classification and prioritization of transient events, using the newly emerging field of time-domain astronomy and synoptic sky surveys as a scientific testbed. The classification problem here is different from the usual situations: the data are sparse and/or incomplete, heterogeneous, and evolving as the new measurements come in; the decision process has to take into account the uncertainties of the classification process, and the available assets; and so on. While the sky surveys detect transient cosmic events, the scientific returns come from their directed follow-up. It is essential to be able to classify and prioritize interesting events, especially as we move from the present Terascale data streams and tens of candidate events per night, to the future Petascale data regime, with literally millions of candidates, only a handful of which can be followed. Given the problem of data incompleteness and sparsity, the proposers will explore the use of Bayesian techniques that can operate on a set of expert-developed and ML-based priors, using the currently best available data. Some of the methodological challenges include incorporation of the contextual information and human expertise and optimal combination of separate classifier outputs, as well as new methods developed in this project. All of the algorithmic developments will be done keeping the robustness and scalability in mind, and tested on real scientific use cases."

The focus will be to explore the nature of physics beyond the successful standard model of strong, weak and electromagnetic forces using results from neutrino physics and theoretical ideas such as supersymmetry, grand unification and string theory. Neutrino masses have already provided some clues as to the nature of this new physics. The current and planned experiments at various laboratories around the world using neutrinos, protons, electrons and muons are expected to add considerably to this knowledge. The plan is to use these results and predict new ones to test the different theoretical ideas mentioned above. This research will also explore ways to resolve some of the puzzles of cosmology such as nature of dark matter in the universe, origin of matter-anti-matter asymmetry, nature of the expansion of the early universe etc. using the same theoretical ideas and propose ways to test them in different experiments.<br/><br/>The hope is that this research will provide answers to some of the outstanding questions of modern physics such as (i) what is the origin of the mass of fundamental particles; (ii) are all the diverse forces of nature such as gravity, electro-magnetism, weak and nuclear forces really different manifestations of one force that operates at very short distances; (iii) why are some forces weaker than others; (iv) are the most elementary building blocks of matter point-like particles or strings; (v) are there extra hidden space dimensions in nature? There will be strong participation in this research by post-doctoral associates, graduate students as well as undergraduate and high school students. It will therefore provide training for future scientists by bringing them into close contact with the frontier areas of research in this exciting field."

0.141001,"9901663<br/> Stacy McGaugh<br/><br/>Numerous studies have now shown that the range of observed galaxy surface brightnesses and sizes is bounded by observational selection - principally discrimination against galaxies of low surface brightness - and not by the intrinsic properties of galaxies. To determine the luminosity density of the Universe, the geometry of space-time and the evolution of galaxies requires a full range of galaxy surface brightnesses and sizes. <br/><br/>Dr. McGaugh led a team that has completed a CCD imaging survey covering 100 deg2 designed to discover galaxies having very low surface brightness. The survey is sensitive to an R band surface brightness of mR = 27.4 mag arcsec-2 or better. His team is conducting several ancillary studies using this database. Galaxies cataloged from this survey are used to address a number of outstanding issues in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. These include the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of galaxies, the contribution of low surface brightness galaxies to the galaxy luminosity and mass functions, the stability of disks imbedded in dark matter halos, star formation thresholds in disks and the optical edges of galaxy disks."

0.08,"Last year, antihydrogen was trapped for the first time by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN. By this point hundreds of antiatoms have been trapped for times as long as 1000 s. While this was a remarkable achievement, the ALPHA apparatus is not well configured for most measurements of the properties of antihydrogen, and must be rebuilt to allow laser and better microwave access. Furthermore, the trapping rates, while sufficient to begin studies of the properties of antimatter, are lower than optimal. There are two broad challenges to improving the trapping rate: (1) Understanding the behavior of the positron and antiproton plasmas from which the antihydrogen is synthesized; and (2) Understanding the atomic processes by which positrons and antiprotons recombine. Antihydrogen synthesis lies on the boundary between atomic and plasma physics, and cannot be studied properly without employing tools from both fields. The long term goal of antihydrogen research is to search for differences between the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences might occur between the spectra of the two species. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. Another place differences might occur is in the gravitational interactions of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences could solve the baryogenesis problem. A third area of potential difference is in the fractional charge of antihydrogen. The net charge of antihydrogen is only known to about 10^-7 relative to the unit charge. Positive results from any of these measurements would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. <br/><br/>The long-¬term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-¬antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. The trapping of antihydrogen last year was extraordinarily widely noted in the lay and scientific press. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The proposed research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups."
1.16048,"A broad range of climate dynamics research motivated by extra-solar planet climate, current and past Solar System planetary climate, and deep-time Earth climate will be pursued. A common feature of this class of problems is the focus on collective behavior emerging from coupling of interesting fluid mechanical effects to interesting effects from novel radiative transfer, novel thermodynamics, or novel geochemistry. Specific problems include the effects of clouds and subsaturation on the runaway greenhouse, the climate of Super-Earths about M-dwarf stars, and the seasonal cycles of planets in highly eccentric orbits. Problems related to the Neoproterozoic climate of Earth include the effect of coupled dust/ice/climate evolution on deglaciation of the Snowball Earth, the dynamical effects of carbon-dioxide condensation, and the nature of the post-Snowball hothouse climate. In addition, several investigations bearing on anthropogenic Earth climate change will be carried out, including modeling related to the use of past mountain-glacier extent in paleothermometry, investigations of the physical nature of feedbacks leading to high climate sensitivity, and continued development of stochastic models of atmospheric humidity.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this project include contributions to human resources development for addressing pressing problems in climate change on Earth. The novel and imaginative problems suggested by extra-solar planet climate are an effective way to motivate mathematicians, physicists and astrophysicists at all career levels to get involved in basic problems in atmospheric physics and dynamics. The demonstration of the universal applicability of basic physical principles across planets with diverse climates helps the public to build confidence in the physics on which forecasts of global warming are based; moreover, the curiosity-driven research on such problems can lead to unanticipated advances in things like radiative transfer modeling and can help shake loose new ideas that may relate to Earth climate. Finally, by contributing to the understanding of habitability, the research serves a deep-seated human need for exploration and understanding the place of humanity in the Universe, in much the same was as does research on cosmology."
0.04876,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, left over from the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the Galaxy, yielding a sidereal modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. <br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) dark matter experiment is a leader in the field of directional dark matter detection, with sensitivity to the powerful angular signature of nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The collaboration will be testing their next prototype detector, DRIFT-IIe, above ground at Occidental College. It features an inherently scalable design including a redesigned field cage, a texturized, thin-film cathode, a new, transparent wire readout which doubles the fiducial volume per readout, and a new every-wire data acquisition system which allows for lower noise and fiducialization in the detector plane. <br/><br/>The potential of DRIFT's capabilities have promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience."
0.88,"The discovery that neutrinos have mass and that lepton flavor is not conserved has been one of the most exciting developments in particle physics in the last 15 years. It was the first disagreement with the Standard Model and it may well lead to a deeper understanding of why our world is the way it is. The program consists of two experiments, MINOS and NOvA. MINOS is a mature experiment, slated to take data at most for two more years. On the other hand, the civil construction for NOvA has just started and data taking will not start before the end of 2012. Both experiments utilize the NuMI neutrino beam line at Fermilab. The MINOS detector is located underground in a former iron mine in Soudan, MN, and is located 735 km from Fermilab. <br/><br/>The most exiting possibility in the field is the question of CP violation. If CP is violated in neutrino physics, that would make more likely the hypothesis of leptogenesis, the scheme which might explain the preponderance of matter over antimatter in our universe and thus explain how is it that we exist. The impact of these studies extends beyond particle physics. The intellectual content of these investigations is such that it excites the public-at-large and especially the young people. Many young people are drawn to science because it can answer fundamental questions like the origin and eventual fate of the universe. We believe that the neutrinos are fundamental particles; they existed from the very beginning and played an important role in the evolution of today's world. They help shape the lives of the stars and carry away most of the energy in a supernova explosion. Thus neutrino physics studies are closely connected with those in astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The program will provide training ground for future scientists and engineers; while doing their PhD and post-PhD research, young men and women will learn modern techniques in software and analysis and become familiar with the state of the art instrumentation. It also will have an impact on the local population, many of whom have never been exposed before to science and scientific way of thinking. MINOS already has an active outreach program and NOvA is planning to emulate a lot of it."
0.092942,"This project will involve theoretical research on various aspects of quantum field theory and its relationship to gravitational theory and cosmology. The research will especially focus upon issues relating to quantum fluctuations, either in gravitational systems or in other contexts (such as boundary effects) which are analogous to gravity. One line of investigation will study the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in flat spacetime. New physical effects which may be testable by experiment will be sought. A closely related line of investigation will study the effects of fluctuations of the gravitational field itself. When quantum matter fields act as the source of the gravitational field, there will often be large fluctuations in the energy density and pressure of the source which will translate into large fluctuations in the gravitational field. The effects of these fluctuations will be investigated. There are also fluctuations due to the quantum nature of the gravitational field itself. These will be studied in the context of a model where a background bath of gravitons causes the lightcone to be slightly smeared out. This smearing may produce effects upon other quantum fields which will lead to insights about the quantum nature of gravity and possibly even observable effects. In the latter case, one would also gain important information about the origin and evolution of the universe through the background of relic gravitons."
0.24,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This project will involve theoretical studies of several topics relating to quantum fluctuations and gravitation. Particular attention will be paid to issues relating to the correlation and anti-correlation of fluctuations of the quantum stress tensor that describes, among other things, the local energy density in a quantum field. The topics to be investigated include the effects of quantum stress tensor fluctuation in cosmology, especially in inflationary models. Previous work by the PI and his collaborators has indicated that these effects may be able to slowly accumulate, and thereby have a potentially significant role in the evolution of the universe. This possibility will be further studied. A closely related topic is the search for the probability distribution for stress tensor fluctuations, which is of interest in inflationary models, including ones which explore the possibility of a ""multiverse"" much larger than the observable universe. Other aspects of this project will seek to propose new laboratory experiments looking for negative energy density and related ""sub-vacuum"" phenomena, where some quantity fluctuates below its usual value in empty space. The project will examine selected aspects of the Casimir force, especially its fluctuations, and of fluctuations in condensed matter systems. These topics are of interest both for their own sake, and as analog models to better understand quantum effects in gravity theory. <br/><br/>This project is expected to have a broader impact through possible benefits to other fields of science, to education, and to technology. The insights and techniques of this work may be useful outside of the specific subfields of physics being investigated. The project will further education through the training of graduate students and by the involvement of faculty at primarily teaching institutions. It should also produce examples which can be used to explain some of the concepts of quantum theory and relativity to students on a variety of educational levels. The work on Casimir forces may eventually be useful in nanotechnology. A better knowledge of Casimir forces is likely to become important for the construction of small scale devices. Similarly, the study of quantum correlations in this project may have applications to quantum information and quantum computing."

Several specific topics have been selected for detailed study, some of which involve the gravitational field, and others of which involve nongravitational systems. These topics include constraints on negative energy densities which derive from quantum field theory. Such constraints impose severe restrictions on the use of negative energy to create exotic gravitational fields. A second topic will be fluctuations of the stress tensor of quantized matter fields. This is of interest both in the context of quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field and of the theory of van der Waals forces between solid bodies. The quantum fluctuations of boundaries, including horizons, will also be subject to investigation.

These include the effects of such fluctuations on electron interference patterns, and the possibility of amplifying vacuum fluctuations in the context of van der Waals forces.<br/><br/>This research aims to understand more deeply some of the effects of quantum fluctuations in a variety of situations, and in particular, to understand aspects of the quantum nature of the gravitational field.<br/>***"
0.06,"The source of the highest energy cosmic rays, with energies above 10^19 eV, is an enigma. It is hard to see how conventional acceleration mechanisms (such as active galactic nuclei) can reach these energies. Furthermore, protons of such high energies are little affected by magnetic fields, and thus their arrival directions point back to their sources, but no generally agreed-upon sources are seen in those directions. This puzzle motivates the study of nontraditional sources. Topological defects, such as domain walls, strings, and monopoles, may have been produced by phase transitions in the early universe. Cosmic strings may also arise from superstring theory. Because such objects naturally have a very high energy scale, it is possible for them to release very massive particles which decay to produce the observed cosmic rays. It is also possible for some topological defects to move very rapidly and to produce very strong magnetic fields, and thus to act as acceleration sources. This project will calculate, by analysis and computer simulation, the expected cosmic ray fluxes from the various topological defect sources, for comparison with existing observational data and the results of new experiments, in particular the Auger observatory, now in operation in Argentina. The most exciting possible outcome of this work would be an explanation of observed events in terms of a specific source model. But even a negative result would lead to important bounds on topological defect models. In either case, we would learn important information about early-universe cosmology and fundamental physics at the highest energy scales"
0.06655,"9407132 Simon The investigator and his colleague undertake an extensive computational and analytical study of the energy surfaces given by the energy functions on finite-dimensional conformation spaces of knots. The focus is on two conformation spaces: polygonal knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic knots are those given by finite Fourier series parametrizations. Recent theorems relate the invariants given by these energy functions to classical invariants such as crossing number. So this project should lead to a better understanding of knots realizable with relatively low degrees of freedom. Knot theory is the mathematical study of the everyday objects called knots. Once thought the purview of theoretical mathematicians, knot theory has recently found a wide range of applications, in fields as diverse as molecular biology and cosmology. For example, DNA molecules are usually knotted, and in the replication process must somehow become untangled. In this project the investigators apply sophisticated computing techniques to the study of knots. In particular, they continue the development of a new approach to knots: physical knot theory. The mathematical knot is given physical properties, and knot types are distinguished by computations involving these properties. For example, knot conformations can be assigned an energy, and then knot types can be distinguished by considering minimum energy conformations. The conceptual basis of the approach is familiar to researchers in biology, chemistry, and physics as well as mathematics. The project produces both theoretical results and software."

These atmospheric Cherenkov<br/>telescopes will use the imaging concept developed by the Whipple Observatory Gamma-Ray Collaboration and used to detect the first galactic and extragalactic sources of TeV gamma-rays. VERITAS will achieve an order of magnitude better flux sensitivity than existing telescopes. It will be the only gamma-ray telescope array in the northern hemisphere and will complement the HESS and CANGAROO observatories in the southern hemisphere.<br/><br/>Each VERITAS telescope will have an effective mirror area of 100 sq m (equivalent to a telescope of aperture ~12m) and a long focal length (12 m) with the optical design optimized for good angular resolution, a large field of view, and minimum wavefront distortion. Each telescope camera will have 499 pixels covering a 3.5 degree field of view with 0.15 degree resolution. VERITAS will have appreciable sensitivity at 80 GeV (where it will overlap with the next generation space telescopes) and at 10 TeV (where it will overlap with particle air shower detectors). With stereoscopic imaging, the array will achieve unprecedented angular resolution, energy resolution and background rejection over three decades of energy. The minimum detectable flux sensitivity will be 1% of the Crab Nebula at 200 GeV, a factor of 20 improvement over the most sensitive telescopes currently operating in this energy range. <br/><br/>The primary scientific objectives of VERITAS will be the study of active galactic nuclei, supernova remnants, pulsars, the galactic plane, and gamma-ray bursts; in addition a sky survey will be made to search for new astrophysical sources. VERITAS will also explore new physics in areas such as neutralino annihilation, quantum gravity and primordial black hole evaporation. VERITAS will effectively complement GLAST, the next major high energy gamma-ray telescope in space; they will overlap in the 50 GeV to 300 GeV energy range allowing important cross correlations. Together, VERITAS and GLAST may solve the problem of the origin of the cosmic radiation as well as probing fundamental questions in physics and cosmology. <br/><br/>The VERITAS Collaboration consists of groups from ten institutions: Iowa State University, McGill University, National University of Ireland, Purdue University, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, University of California at Los Angeles, University of Chicago, University of Leeds, University of Utah, and Washington University. The array will be built at a dark site on Kitt Peak in southern Arizona. <br/><br/>VERITAS is a unique scientific endeavor which offers unusual opportunities for education and outreach. Because the project falls in the interface between high energy physics and astronomy, between particle astrophysics and high energy astrophysics, it is inherently multi-disciplinary. The VERITAS Outreach program will capitalize on the experience of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, as well as that of the university groups involved in VERITAS.

0.077004,"This project will focus on the distributions and physical properties of molecular and atomic clouds in galaxies and their relations to star formation. The molecular clouds are traced by millimeter wave emission from carbon monoxide, and the atomic gas is seen via 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen (HI). The distributions of star forming regions will be determined by observations of ionized hydrogen. This research will address the specific problems of: (1) the effects of spiral density waves on the molecular clouds and the local star formation efficiency; (2) the physical properties of the molecular gas in the nuclei and disks of late-type galaxies; (3) the evolution origin of the interstellar medium in lenticular galaxies; and (4) the role of HI in molecular cloud shielding within dwarf irregular galaxies. This work will lead to an improved understanding of the global and local processes which regulate the star formation histories of galaxies.

The tasks to be carried out are as follows. Trilling will make new observations in the DES program. Trilling and Buie will also carry out a comprehensive photometry program that will be used to calibrate the DES catalog. Both of these observing tasks will make extensive use of telescopes in Arizona and Chile. Lastly, Trilling and Buie will carry out completeness experiments on the DES catalog. These three tasks prepare the way for scientific analysis of the Kuiper Belt using the 500 DES KBOs. The first step of the science analysis will be to carry out a statistical study of the DES data in combination with other surveys' data to derive, with strong confidence, the differential sky density of KBOs. This mathematical expression can be directly related to accretion timescales through theoretical models to provide a tight constraint on the duration of accretion in the Kuiper Belt. Lastly, combining the DES dataset with newly available KBO albedo information from the Space Infrared Telescope Facility allows a true KBO size distribution to be derived for the first time. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of these technical tasks and science goals lies in the quest to understand<br/>how the outer Solar System formed and evolved. The results derived here will be crucially important in constraining and driving the next generation of outer Solar System accretion models. These models have impact beyond the Kuiper Belt, as planets in the Solar System (and beyond) underwent accretion as part of their formation processes. This program will have a broader impact in the community primarily through participation in the University of Arizona Space Grant program. Through the Space Grant program, Trilling will recruit one undergraduate research intern per year from among the diverse pool of applications. This series of students will have specific research tasks, including participating in observing runs. Trilling will also participate in Space Grant's Science Speakers program to present science results in classrooms and to the general public. Such a program uniquely allows bringing knowledge to communities of racial, ethnic, and economic diversity. Lastly, in addition to public outreach, this research program will produce an extensive photometric catalog, which will be widely available, and will calibrate the large DES archive, which will also be available for use in various other scientific projects from Solar System science to cosmology."

0.059955,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Brandon Murakami of Rhode Island College.<br/><br/>This project concerns rare lepton decays and their possible appearance at the Large Hadron Collider (at CERN) and at the MEG experiment (at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland). As part of this research, Professor Murakami intends to focus on the decay of the muon to an electron-plus-photon state, a process which is being studied by the MEG experiment and which is forbidden by the Standard Model of particle physics. For this reason, any measurement of this process is an unambiguous indication of physics beyond the Standard Model --- particularly scenarios currently under investigation as potential solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem. Professor Murakami plans to investigate all theoretical issues concerning this rare decay and its potential experimental observation, focusing on those involving weak-scale supersymmetry.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to include significant broader impacts. Professor Murakami has been contributing to the overall science awareness in Rhode Island with public lectures, participation in the NSF-funded TheoryNet program which partners theoretical particle physicists with high-school classrooms, and offers a freshman-level course on particle physics and cosmology, designed to recruit undergraduates into physics. He also participates in the Department of Education's ""Upward Bound"" program. As part of this project, the PI intends to continue all of these activities."

This data will allow particle physicists to probe the ""Standard Model"", which is the best current understanding of the fundamental interactions and building blocks of matter. Since the LHC is taking data at a higher energy than has previously been explored, it is possible that physics beyond the Standard Model will be discovered. This project will in part focus on signatures for beyond-the-Standard-Model physics that can be probed at the LHC. The goal is to find ways to determine properties of new non-Standard Model particles, such as mass and spin, even if we do not know what the new physics happens to be. This project will also focus on theoretical techniques to improve calculations of various particle-physics signals, including calculating higher-order perturbative corrections, summing infinite series of corrections, and pursuing path-integral techniques. <br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The proposed project is well suited for the participation of students at different levels, allowing them to acquire knowledge and skills in theoretical physics, mathematical methods, computer programming and data analysis. This project also has important connections to experimental high-energy physics and cosmology, thus strengthening synergistic effects between these different fields of specialization.

The study of neutrino physics and dark matter is of high interest to particle and nuclear physicists and astrophysicists. The ongoing and proposed dark matter and neutrino experiments are expected to unveil the answers to critical questions asked by scientists for last few decades. Recent precise measurements of all the neutrino mixing angles necessitate a theoretical roadmap for the future. Understanding the nature of dark matter better would help to understand the composition of the cosmos better. <br/><br/>The scope of the 2012 summer CETUP* program will include the ""Dark Matter"" program followed by a three day interlude program (July 19-21) comprising of ""Dark Matter, Neutrino Physics and Unification."" Following that, there will be a week and a half long focused theory session on ""Neutrino Physics and Unification"" and a 3-day long Physics Working Group workshop of Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) (July 30 - August 1).<br/><br/>Among the Broader Impacts, understanding neutrino properties better could have significant implications in astrophysics and cosmology, and may offer solutions to the current puzzles such as the abundance of matter over antimatter in the Universe. Outreach efforts will aim to share the excitement of this research with K-12 students and general public. Selected CETUP* participants will give three public lectures that outline the importance of dark matter and neutrino research. Such presentations at a level comprehensible by the general public are important for developing public support for national investment in basic science. South Dakota Public Broadcasting will record and stream the lectures state wide as well as post it on their website for those who couldn't participate live.

In turn, the extreme physical conditions of such sources probe untested ranges of neutrino properties, advancing knowledge of the weak and possible new interactions. The theoretical projects supported by this award use neutrinos and other new messengers to attack long-standing questions in nuclear astrophysics, weak interactions, and especially their connections. The primary focus is on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, the flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos from all core collapses in the universe, a guaranteed source that is near detection. A secondary focus is on prospecting for new neutrino sources and working to move them to the detected or guaranteed category.<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary work of these projects connects central topics in nuclear physics to frontier research in astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics. It also connects theoretical efforts to experimental and observational efforts ranging from underground laboratories to satellite surveys. Graduate students and postdocs participating in this research will thus receive training in forefront interdisciplinary topics relevant to present and planned investments in experimental facilities.

The proposed research will be directed toward advancing our understanding of the morphology of the interstellar neutral atomic hydrogen in the Galaxy, the nature of the interstellar magnetic field, and the cosmic abundance of deuterium. Dr. Heiles' studies are carried out primarily through observations of spectral lines of atoms and molecules at radio wavelengths. The study of the morphology of atomic hydrogen in the Galaxy may provide important information about those cosmic processes that shape the structure of the interstellar medium, such as supernova explosions and stellar winds. The basic magnetic field studies are significant for understanding such interstellar processes as star formation, the support of gas in the Galactic halo, and the heating of the interstellar medium via various types of hydromagnetic waves. Finally, a good determination of the abundance of deuterium in a variety of astronomical sites is fundamental to cosmology."

About 30-50 new systems will be identified and studied with a new census of extremely low-mass white dwarfs identified using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hyper-Velocity Star Survey. This work will provide critical new insights into the formation and fate of exotic low-mass white dwarfs. It will also give us new tests of General Relativity and tidal evolution in short-period systems.<br/><br/>Understanding the constituents and history of the cosmos lies at the heart of modern astrophysics. In the last 15 years, observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) indicate that the expansion of the universe is dominated by dark energy. Until we find the progenitors, it is impossible to understand the systematic uncertainties and to optimize SNe Ia to definitively explore cosmology. The SNe Ia progenitor problem is therefore a key problem in astronomy today, and this research promises to add significant knowledge to our understanding of these exotic systems. The work also has a broad plan for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral involvement in the observations, data analysis, and dissemination of results."

0.4306,"FRG<br/><br/>Geometric Function Theory is a broad area of mathematics that has its roots in the classical theory of analytic functions of one complex variable. From the very beginning this field has had connections to potential theory, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, and geometric topology. The second half of the twentieth century brought about new areas like quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, with links to nonlinear PDEs and harmonic analysis. The research group is planning to tackle some of the most important open problems in this broadly construed field by using our diverse strengths. Examples of the problems include understanding the integrability properties of derivatives of conformal mappings, finding criteria for recognizing metric spaces up to bi-Lipschitz or quasiconformal equivalence, further developing the theory of holomorphic curves and its quasiregular generalizations, and investigating algebraic conditions related to quasiconvexity of energy functionals. The intellectual merit of our activity will be found in a deepened understanding of fundamental questions in Geometric Function Theory, in an increase of the links to other fields of mathematics, and in a broader scope of possible applications.<br/><br/>Core mathematics keeps reappearing outside its own realm with dramatic success and consequences. Recent examples range from cosmology (where deep topological issues arise regarding the proposed new dimensions for the universe) to material science (where deformation of elastic bodies are studied by methods of the Calculus of Variations) to engineering (where function theoretic methods have led to advances in control theory). The latter two examples are directly connected with the work of our research group, as are topological issues pertaining to the geometry of three dimensional spaces. Another new feature with possible far reaching reverberations is to use function theoretic methods in studying spaces that are not smooth in the classical sense; such spaces naturally occur when Riemannian structures degenerate and form singularities. The main strength of our group is that its members have common roots, but multifarious interests, so as to make advancement in and connections between separate fields. The broader impact of our activity will be the education of new scholars who understand the methods and techniques in the field, and who know how to find applications of their knowledge to other parts of mathematics and sciences. We will put great weight on passing on the important questions to the younger generation and on enabling them to perform independent research."

The program will publish a sample of approximately 1000 clusters with measured masses and well characterized errors.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, building tutorials for web-based astronomy tools which lead non-specialists through some of the greatest astronomical discoveries, allowing non-scientists to discover for themselves the fundamental laws of the Universe."

The approach is to use the Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope with narrow-band interference filters centered on redshifted Lyman-alpha emission in the range 4<z<7 and multi-color deep imaging to search for high redshift galaxies in that range. Candidates identified in this way will then be followed up with slit spectroscopy using the Keck, and Gemini telescopes with the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck telescope, and the near-infrared spectrographs NIRSPEC and IRCS.<br/><br/>The nature of the earliest galaxies -- their properties and evolution -- is a topic of intense interest which has been placed within our reach by the new generation of large telescopes. The present program is intended to explore the very earliest (z=4-7) galaxy formation and the properties of these very high redshift galaxies using the capabilities of the new 8- and 10-m class telescopes. An extensive faint emission-line, faint galaxy survey conducted with deep narrowband imaging searches will be combined with extremely deep imaging in multiple colors to identify distant galaxies in early stages of active star formation. This technique has already been successfully pioneered on the Keck telescope to identify some of the most distant galaxies currently known. This project applies these techniques on the Keck, Gemini, and Subaru telescopes, where very wide field cameras, such as the 0.5 degree X 0.5 degree wide SuprimeCam on the Subaru 8.3-m telescope, and new wide-area spectrographs will be coming on line over the next two years. International cooperation in using these complementary facilities will provide large samples of these most distant galaxies, to explore the global star formation history of the Universe, and<br/>the evolution in the numbers and properties of galaxies at very early times.

0.140082,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>The project is aimed at obtaining constructive proofs of existence of various particular solutions of the multi-dimensional compressible Euler and potential flow equations. Constructive proofs provide not only mathematical rigor, but also detailed information about flow structure and behavior under parameter changes. This information has allowed progress on important engineering questions, such as transition from regular to Mach reflection or weak versus strong shocks at wedges and ramps. Other open problems, like the nature of supersonic bubbles at wings or the von Neumann paradox for triple points, also require new techniques for constructing particular solutions revealing structural information. Even more importantly, recent examples show that particular solutions can reveal non-uniqueness and instability of the underlying model equations and the numerical schemes used to solve them. The project will study narrower function classes where well-posedness is more likely. <br/><br/>The Euler equations and related systems model the flow of gas or liquid, a central problem in physics and engineering. Applications in science and technology abound, from the theory of flight over combustion engines, hydraulics, magneto-hydrodynamic plasma, atmospheric and oceanic motion, to stars and nebulae in cosmology. Many applications rely on computer simulations of flows. However, results of computations are not perfectly reliable; sometimes spurious features are observed that do not occur in nature. The project relates these poorly understood problems with numerical simulations to previously unknown flaws of the underlying mathematical models and investigates possible remedies."

The first project, a collaboration between Computer Science and Astrophysics, deals with problems particularly challenging for parallel implementation due to the combination of interacting models and a highly irregular dynamic nature. The goals are to develop parallel algorithms and implementations for a range of computations, to develop generalizable and portable techniques preserving locality while providing load balance, to extend existing parallel languages; use runtime systems of these languages, to build libraries of partitioning techniques and<br/>algorithms. The second project, a collaboration between CS and the School of Medicine at Stanford University, with similar goals, simulates inherently slow processes in structural biology.

0.097888,"Professor Shapiro's group will complete the analysis of their 1987 experiment to measure the deflection of radio waves due to the gravitational effects of the Sun. Using the technique of very-long-baseline interferometry, they observed two radio sources over a two-week interval centered on the annual passage of the Sun in front of one of the sources. By fitting this data with a model that includes a free parameter scaling the effects predicted by general relativity, they will determine the gravitational deflection with a standard error of 0.1 percent of the magnitude predicted by general relativity. Improving the accuracy of one of the few observational tests of general relativity is important not only as a test of the currently accepted theory of gravity, but also due to the role of general relativistic gravitation in the understanding of cosmology, black holes, quasars, and other massive astronomical objects. This ""light""-deflection experiment is an advance over earlier ones since it uses signals recorded in three widely-separated radio-frequency bands (2, 8, and 23 GHz), allowing for higher accuracy corrections for the observational errors contributed by the dispersion of radio waves in the ionosphere and the solar corona."
2.556,"The disciplines of particle physics, cosmology and mathematics are coming together today in remarkable ways. Research in theoretical elementary particle physics and string theory will examine how the world works, from the strings that may lie deep inside the smallest particles to the edge of the visible universe and beyond. The tools developed in doing this may influence the nature of mathematics as well. The areas to be studied include the large-scale structure of the universe, the nature of space- time, the fundamental forces of nature and the most basic constituents of matter. Both phenomenologically and with powerful new techniques arising from string theory, the research will study the properties of matter, such as revealed at the largest accelerators (the Tevatron, and in the next decade, the Large Hadron Collider). This endeavor should explain the origin of particle masses. In addition, the work will seek the underlying explanation of CP violation -- the difference between the behavior of matter and that of antimatter. This is a tiny effect soon to be explored further at the BABAR collider in Stanford, but it is likely to explain why we are made of matter, not antimatter. Other challenges to be addressed involve the physics of supersymmetry (a striking, but still hypothetical prediction of string theory), the quantum mechanics of black holes, and the physics and mathematics underlying string theory. These researches will deepen our understanding of the fundamental processes occurring in the universe and lead to new insights in mathematics and quantum field theory."

These will be used to test different kinematic QSO models ( inflow vs. outflow) for the broad line emission regions.<br/><br/>Lurking at the center of many massive galaxies are supermassive Black Holes (BH). If there is material nearby, the BH will trap and accrete this matter releasing a huge amount of energy which will show up as increased luminosity of the galaxy nucleus. Galaxies which possess such an accreting BH are said to have an ""active Nucleus"" (AGN). Accretion is an inherently unstable process. The accretion region close to the BH is called the Broad Line Region (BLR). The BLR is luminous because it is photoionized by the hard (UV and x-ray) continuum flux produced very close to the BH. Because this ionizing radiation is variable, so is the BLR. Thus the emission lines from the BLR ""echo"" the variations in the continuum flux. Using these ""echoes"" structures near the BH with microarcsecond scales can be mapped. To do this one needs a very long time baseline of well-sampled observations of the variations in the BLR. This requires data over weeks or months. The ""HET Echo Mapping Project"" is a new research project which aims to: (1) Map the size, geometry, and flow of the BLR gas. (2) Make direct estimates of the mass of the central BH using the geometry and kinematics of the BLR. (3) map AGN with BH of 10 to 100 times the mass of those previously measured.

0.162977,"Convergence of Riemannian Manifolds<br/><br/>Over the past three decades mathematicians have gained deep new insight into Riemannian manifolds by applying the methods of Gromov-Hausdorff, Lipschitz and metric measure convergence. Such techniques have been particularly useful for studying manifolds with bounds on sectional or Ricci curvature, but a new weaker notion of convergence is needed to understand manifolds without such strong conditions. Recently the PI and Dr. Wenger have applied work of Drs. Ambrosio and Kirchheim to introduce a new distance between manifolds: the intrinsic flat distance. While the convergence is weaker than previous forms of convergence, the limit spaces, called Integral Current Spaces, are countably H^mrectifiable. Applying work of Cheeger-Colding, Gromov and Perelman, the PI and Dr. Wenger have shown that the Gromov-Hausdorff and intrinsic flat limits of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature agree. However, in general the limit spaces are different and sequences which do not converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense may still converge in the intrinsic flat sense. The PI will study the properties of these limit spaces under a variety of conditions on the sequence of manifolds and prove stability theorems under these weaker conditions. In particular the PI proposes to improve her results on the stability of the Friedmann model.<br/><br/>The spacelike universe is described in Friedmann cosmology as an isotropic three dimensional Riemannian manifold that expands in time starting from the initial Big Bang. In reality the universe is not isotropic because it is bent by gravity in a nonuniform way. Weak gravitational lensing (due to dust) and strong gravitational lensing (due to massive objects) has been observed by the Hubble to distort regions of space. The universe is thus, at best, close to the Friedmann model in some sense. In prior work, under strong assumptions, the PI has shown that a Riemannian manifold which is almost isotropic (in a way which allows for weak gravitational lensing and localized strong gravitational lensing) is close to the Friedmann model in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This is proven by studying the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of increasingly isotropic manifolds. Now the PI proposes to prove that under weaker assumptions, the universe is close to the Friedmann model in the intrinsic flat sense by studying the intrinsic flat limits of Riemannian manifolds. Using the intrinsic flat distance will not only allow for weak and strong gravitational lensing but also allow for the possible existence of wormholes.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------"
0.16,"The search for gravitational waves is already opening a new window on the universe and will allow new tests of our current theory of gravity. Sources of these waves are among the most extreme astrophysical systems imaginable the in the whole universe. They include binary systems of black holes and neutron stars, and stars orbiting and eventually spiralling into very large black holes. New methods of analysis will be developed to describe the dynamical evolution of these systems as they emit energy in the form of gravitational waves.<br/>Current descriptions of binary sources of gravitational waves are based on approximations of small speeds and weak gravitational fields. They begin to break down just when the physical system is at its most interesting, as the objects approach each other in their final stage of coalescence. New, accurate theoretical predictions will be developed, and will provide important guidance to experimental effort leading toward the detection of gravitational waves and the characterization of their sources.<br/>This research will have a broad impact upon our understanding of General Relativity to extreme astrophysical systems. Through the rigorous training of students, it will also have an impact upon science education, appreciation, and its public understanding, at all levels. People from all walks of life seem fascinated by physics examples involving black holes or cosmology. Four graduate students and an undergraduate are deeply involved in this project.

0.00507,"The study of dust over cosmic time is a key field of astronomy and astrophysics that has implications from galaxy evolution and cosmology to planet formation. Dust forms as stars die and is spread into the interstellar medium; some is then formed into the next generation of stars and planets, while a large fraction stays in the interstellar medium. This dust reprocesses ultraviolet and optical light, absorbing it and re-emitting the energy into the mid- and far-infrared. Even a small or moderate amount of dust can greatly affect the observed properties of galaxies. This award supports research to study the dust properties of galaxies in the early universe, which are thought to be progenitors to Milky Way type galaxies. This study has only become possible very recently with the commissioning of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which can directly detect the thermal emission from dust in these tiny galaxies. The research will be conducted in partnership with Prof. Masami Ouchi of the University of Tokyo to do a first-of-a-kind study of these galaxies, initiating a collaboration with the potential to be fruitful for many years.<br/><br/>Specifically, this work will use spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) software developed by Conroy et al. FSPS uses the dust models of Draine and Lee (2007) to parametrize cosmic dust using three parameters, dust mass, PAH fraction, and dust grain size distribution. As most of the light in the universe is from dust emission, understanding these properties, and how they change over the lifetime of the universe, is of critical concern. Using deep ALMA data, we can probe for dust emission from the numerous star forming galaxies discovered in Lyman-alpha surveys in these fields. These Lyman-alpha emitters are generally small, low mass galaxies that will form into Milky Way sized galaxies. The bright Lyman-alpha line provides an excellent way to find a study small galaxies otherwise very difficult to find. Understanding their dust properties is crucial to further our understanding of these galaxies and investigate possible histories of the Milky Way.

The stated objective is to locate ~5000 emission-line galaxies in 300 sq.deg. with B<20-21. The survey is on-going; the analysis software has been developed and tested, and over 127 square deg. have already been analyzed. Once complete, the KISS sample of galaxies will have numerous additional applications which cut across many areas of research in astronomy, including chemical evolution in galaxies, the large-scale distribution of galaxies, and the determination of the abundance of helium produced in the Big Bang.<br/><br/>Galaxies with active nuclei or intense starbursts represent the most energetic phenomena known in the universe. Galaxian activity is very common and occurs on all scales, from the super-luminous quasars down to extremely active star formation in dwarf galaxies. Much of our knowledge of active galaxies and starbursts has come about by studying galaxies cataloged in objective-prism surveys that used Schmidt telescopes and photographic plates. The recent opportunity to use more sensitive digital detectors has prompted the present program to discover much fainter active galaxies than were previously accessible. The KISS project (KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey), is designed to discover faint, distant galaxies which possess strong emission lines, a clear signature of galaxian activity. The survey technique used is extremely successful, discovering new active galaxies at a rate 180 times higher than the most well known previous survey of this type (the Markarian survey). To date a few thousand active and starbursting galaxies have been cataloged. The project will be continued by extending the observations to new areas of the sky. In addition, the large, deep samples will be used<br/>to study galaxian activity of all types, in order to better understand this activity in the context of galaxy formation and evolution. Once the survey observations are complete, the KISS sample of galaxies will have numerous additional applications which cut across many areas of research in astronomy, including chemical evolution in galaxies, the large-scale distribution of galaxies, and the determination of the abundance of helium produced in the Big Bang.

0.480291,"Simulations of galaxy formation generically predict that all luminous galaxies are embedded in extensive tidal debris fields, caused by occasional major mergers and the continuous accretion of small satellite galaxies. These debris fields are curiously missing around actual galaxies. While this may indicate that revisions to the standard cosmology are needed, a more mundane explanation is that we have not yet obtained sufficiently deep observations to detect the debris fields. This award provides support for the Dragonfly Project that will attempt such a detection. The project is an ultra low surface brightness imaging survey with the Dragonfly telescope of all luminous galaxies within a distance of 30 megaparsecs (Mpc) that are visible from New Mexico. Over the award period of 3 years, the investigators will obtain 40 hr deep images of a complete sample of 72 luminous nearby galaxies.<br/><br/>Recent simulations suggest that the debris mostly lives at surface brightnesses of 29 to 31 mag per arcsec^2, fainter than the typical deep imaging limit of about 28 mag per arcsec^2. The investigators have constructed a telescope for the specific purpose of determining whether all galaxies have ultra low surface brightness tidal debris around them on scales of 30--100 kpc. The collected data will reach about 30 mag per arcsec^2 on 3 arcsec scales. The Dragonfly telescope is an array of telephoto lenses coupled with standard charge-coupled device (CCD) imagers. The latest generation of these lenses has nano-fabricated coatings that minimize scattered and reflected light. Together, these lenses constitute a perfectly baffled telescope with extremely fast, all-refractive optics and better scattered light control (by an order of magnitude) than existing reflecting telescopes.<br/><br/>The investigating team will make the fully processed and calibrated images publicly available through a web interface. The project integrates education and research in the following ways: (1) The project is complementary to multi-year instrumentation efforts on large telescopes and is well-suited for graduate student training in astrophysical instrumentation. (2) The straightforward remote operation model lends itself well to classroom teaching and demonstrations. The telescope will be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at Yale University and will also be used as a science demonstration tool for high school students."
0.42,"TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports research and education in theoretical condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and quantum information processing using circuit and cavity QED. The research builds upon theoretical progress during the previous grant period and is driven by recent dramatic experimental and theoretical advances in the quantum mechanics of electrical circuits and in the manipulation of nanomechanical systems via radiation pressure forces. Motivated by the recent experimental progress in 'circuit QED,' the PI will continue his productive collaboration with the Yale experimental group of Schoelkopf and Devoret to realize novel and fundamental strong-coupling quantum optics in microwave electrical circuits. The PI will develop theoretical models of the many-body physics of strongly-interacting microwave polaritons in lattices of superconducting qubits and resonators. Such lattices can be used to simulate strongly-correlated bosons as well as frustrated quantum spins.<br/><br/>Axions are elementary particles proposed to exist by theory which are important candidates to explain the cold dark matter which pervades the universe. In the presence of a strong magnetic field they are predicted to decay into microwave photons. Circuit QED advances are approaching the point where they could dramatically change the way axion dark matter searches are done. In light of recent experimental advances, the PI will evaluate the efficacy of different possible approaches to optimizing microwave photon detection in axion searches.<br/><br/>The PI will also continue collaborations on opto-nano-mechanics with the Yale experimental groups of Jack Harris and Hong Tang and begin collaboration with new faculty member Peter Rakich. A new direction with Harris will be development of models of the opto-mechanics of whispering gallery modes of deformable levitated drops of liquid helium. Another will be collaboration with Rakich on the theoretical and practical limits of narrow line widths which can be achieved in on-chip optomechanical Brillouin lasers. <br/><br/>Applications and extensions of quantum optics ideas for superconducting circuits and opto-mechanical systems will be developed. A new direction will be to propose and develop new ideas for quantum bath engineering which will create 'friction' with the aim to naturally relax quantum systems, not towards their ground states, but rather towards pre-determined entangled many-body states of interest. Such ideas will likely be broadly applicable beyond superconducting qubits to include atomic physics systems and other types of quantum bits and to quantum simulations. <br/><br/>This work has a strong interdisciplinary component which brings together ideas and methods used in the condensed matter, atomic physics, and quantum optics communities. The close collaboration of the PI with experimental groups is leading to new precision microwave measurement techniques at the single photon level which will have applications beyond quantum information processing to probing nanoscale systems generally, and is yielding new forms of ultra-low-noise microwave amplifiers and detectors.<br/><br/><br/>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical research and education on artificial atoms created from electrical circuits made from materials that are superconductors. Superconductors exhibit a quantum mechanical state which can conduct electricity without dissipation. Like real atoms, these artificial atoms can interact with a single quantum or photon of microwave radiation. These superconducting electrical circuits are being developed as the basic hardware for the construction of a quantum computer. A quantum computer would perform computations by manipulating quantum mechanical states and in principle can dramatically outperform the fastest existing computers for some problems. <br/><br/>In addition to this potential practical application, these superconducting circuits can be used to efficiently detect individual microwave photons. The PI will explore applications of this new capability to the improved detection of axions, elementary particles postulated to solve the 'dark matter' problem of cosmology and astrophysics.<br/><br/>The PI will also continue his study of the theory of opto-mechanics in which the feeble pressure exerted by light can be used to cause mechanical motion of small objects and even cool their motion. This is opening up a whole new technology with practical applications in optical communications and measurements. Of particular fundamental interest will be exploration with experimental colleagues of new ideas for applying radiation pressure of light to move and distort magnetically levitated drops of superfluid helium."

They will then generate computer simulations of models for intercluster material (ICM) - interstellar material stripping (ISM), ICM pressure-induced star formation, HI accretion, low and high speed tidal interactions, low velocity mergers, and high-speed collisions.<br/>They will compare their data with these models to try to determine which interaction processes are at work in peculiar galaxies in Virgo. <br/><br/>The Virgo Cluster of galaxies is one of the closest clusters to our own galaxy. Many of the spiral galaxies in the Virgo Cluster are small galaxies with less active star formation than is seen in our own galaxy. This reduced star formation seems to occur only in the outer parts of these galaxies and the investigators doing this research hypothesize that this truncation of starformation is the result of environmental effects related to the proximity of other galaxies within the cluster. This research will conduct several types of observations and compare them with computer simulations to try and identify just which environmental effects are important for the inhibition of star formation.

0.88,"This proposal requests continued support for the University of Chicago group to participate in the building and operation of the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). VERITAS is an array of four 12m aperture reflector telescopes for gamma-ray astronomy in the ~50 GeV to ~50 TeV energy range. These atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes use the imaging technique developed by the Whipple Observatory that detected the first galactic and extragalactic sources of TeV gamma-rays. VERITAS will achieve more than an order of magnitude better sensitivity than Whipple with a significant reduction in energy threshold. <br/><br/>Using stereoscopic imaging, the array will achieve unprecedented angular and energy resolution and background rejection over three decades of energy. The primary scientific objectives of VERITAS are the study of active galactic nuclei, supernova remnants, pulsars, gamma-ray bursts, and the search for new sources. While other arrays of gamma-ray telescopes have become active in the last few years, VERITAS remains the most powerful instrument for observations in the northern hemisphere. The minimum detectable flux sensitivity will be 0.5% of the Crab Nebula at 200 GeV. The angular resolution will be sufficient to map out emission regions in extended sources. Studies suggest that more than 30 supernova remnants and more than 30 active galactic nuclei will be discovered by VERITAS. There are also intriguing indications that sources which are only visible at high energies will be discovered. VERITAS will effectively complement GLAST, the next major high energy gamma-ray telescope in space; together they may solve the problem of the origin of the cosmic radiation while also probing fundamental questions in physics and cosmology. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research manifest in a number of ways, including the advancement of astrophysical knowledge through the exploitation of new technology in unexplored measurement windows."
0.210103,"This proposal requests support for a continuing program of research on the mechanism and scale of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Understanding EWSB is both the last major aspect of the highly successful Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) which needs to be resolved, and also the doorway into physics beyond the SM. The Higgs mechanism is the basic spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the standard model, but it suffers from problems due to the potentially large radiative corrections to its key parameters, the Higgs boson mass and scale of EWSB, which conflict with the experimental bounds on them. The problem then is to find new physics which will stabilize these parameters and which will do so without fine tuning the parameters of the new physics. <br/><br/>The PI proposes to investigate two different approaches to the problem: one makes use of supersymmetry at the weak scale, and the other does not use supersymmetry, but treats the Higgs boson as a pseudo-Goldstone Boson. It turns out that these approaches will have distinctive features which have implications for experiments at the Tevatron and LHC and so so are highly relevant to the field. there are also important implications for Cosmology, including the issues of dark matter, dark energy, nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background. The PI plans thoroughly to explore all of these aspects of EWSB. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposal are mainly concerned with the training of graduate students and postdocs at the university and at summer schools, but also contain a worthwhile outreach program to high schools and the general public."

0.051996,"Research on three major problems concerned with the early universe will be conducted: The first consists of solving the semiclassical backreaction equations when nonconformally coupled free scalar fields are present in homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes. Two aspects of this are of particular interest. One is the initial behaviors of the solutions, as that will determine whether they have initial singularities or particle horizons. The second is how Starobinsky's inflationary models and the R models of Mijic et. al. are affected by the presence of non-conformal fields during the inflationary phase. The second research project consists of solving the backreaction problem for free scalar fields in anisotropic spacetimes. It is of interest to see whether quantum effects change the nature of the singularities in these spacetimes. Also quantitative predictions for the amounts of anisotropy that can be dissipated in various models via particle production will be obtained. The third research project will be an investigation of spontaneous symmetry breaking in spacetimes with compact spatial sections for models with N scalar fields with quartic self- couplings. It has already been shown that spontaneous symmetry breaking for these models in the large N limit does not occur in the Einstein universe. If this result is more general, then it may be of great importance to cosmology."

The lack of understanding of fundamental laws driving the dynamics of many complex networks, and consequently our inability to predict and control their behavior, are among the reasons why many practical problems of great significance remain unsolved for decades. The lack of a complete theory of quantum gravity, unifying all the fundamental interactions, is perhaps the most fundamental problem in physics after Einstein. Motivated by the recent results suggesting that the two problems might in fact be intimately related via a geometric duality between hyperbolic and de Sitter spaces---the former reflecting the latent geometry of complex networks, the latter representing the asymptotic geometry of spacetime in the universe---this project addresses both grand challenges and advances science in both fields by deriving fundamental laws of network dynamics. <br/><br/>The main hypothesis that the project investigates is that one can extend and apply the canonical approach in physics used to study all the fundamental interactions in nature to a wide class of physical systems---complex networks. One part of the project focuses on finding Hamiltonians defining Hamilton's equations of network dynamics, and validating the derived equations against the dynamics of real networks. These equations are expected to be simpler than the corresponding equations in gravitational theories. Other parts of the project focus on building tools to predict this dynamics based on the derived equations, and investigating connections between this dynamics, its conformal invariance in the de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence (dS/CFT) context, and network navigability that may lead to a different interpretation of the dark energy problem in cosmology. This interdisciplinary project combines concepts and methods from mathematical physics and network research by extending the canonical approach in physics to complex networks to advance our understanding of their dynamics, and to explore whether applying theoretical concepts in network science will advance our understanding of dark energy. This project thus opens exciting new research directions by hypothesizing a fundamental connection between Hamiltonian dynamics and network dynamics that until now have been considered completely unrelated. The transformative project thus challenges the conventional wisdom that neither the canonical approach in physics can be useful in studying complex networks, nor network science has anything to offer theoretical physics. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Many problems of broader impacts in science and society are blocked on network dynamics prediction. Examples include disease treatment, drug design, and a variety of link-prediction problems, which are sub-problems of network dynamics prediction. In general, connections between systems as different as the brain, the Internet, and the universe, appeal to general public, foster creative thinking, and attract wider and more diverse circles of students to science and engineering."

The Standard Model describes the structure of all matter in terms of a few fundamental particles (quarks and leptons). Opportunities will be provided to review basic concepts in preparation for this study. Participants will come from the region comprised of western and central Pennsylvania, western New York, eastern Ohio, northern West Virginia, and western Maryland. Selection will be based on the applicants' interest in modern physics and commitment to incorporate modern physics topics in their courses. Applications from minorities and women are encouraged. Participants will receive a $900 stipend, room and board, and a selection of modern physics teaching materials. They also will earn three semester hours of graduate credit. Institute activities will include lectures and discussions, review sessions, films and video tapes, and hands-on activities involving laboratory and demonstration apparatus, computer simulations and modern physics ""games"". Several new modern physics teaching aids will be introduced including ""The Fundamental Particles and Interactions Wall Chart"" and the notebook, ""Topics in Teaching Modern Physics Teacher Resource Materials"". There will be field trips to the Cornell Electron Storage Ring accelerator at Cornell and to the Proton Decay Experiment near Cleveland. Participants will develop two teaching units on modern physics for incorporation into their curriculum and will share experiences and report on progress at local conferences to be held in the Spring of 1991 and Spring 1992. Cost sharing in an amount of $55,724 equals 36% of the NSF award."
0.015,"This three-year award supports U.s.-France cooperative research in mathematical physics between Daniel Boyanovsky, University of Pittsburgh, and Hector J. de Vega, Theoretical Physics Laboratory, University of Paris VI. The main objective of the proposal is to investigate current topics in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics, in particular the early stages of phase transitions, tunneling and metastability in field theory, relationship between quantum integrability and renormalization. These topics have applications to a broad range of problems in cosmology (early stages of evolution of the early universe), particle physics, condensed matter physics (superconductivity) and statistical mechanics. The investigators bring to this collaboration their complementary expertise on these diverse topics. Dr. Boyanovsky has been working on problems in mathematical physics from the point of view of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and field theory.

0.025125,"This project will modernize equipment used in the instruction of physics and support a newly created physics minor program. It will provide not only instrumentation required to provide students with laboratory experiences in Modern Physics, but also to change the way physics is taught by incorporating collaborative and inquiry-based pedagogical methods into the introductory courses. To achieve the interrelated goals of creating and sustaining student interest in physics and improving student understanding of concepts in physics, we will implement a series of new laboratory exercises designed to actively engage students by providing them with immediate feedback through direct computer data acquisition and data analysis. This approach, which will be included in the introductory physics courses required of all science and mathematics majors as well as a new general education course in Cosmology, will significantly impact students' understanding and appreciation of the physical sciences. This project directly supports and extends new, inquiry-based curricula implemented in other disciplines within the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics beginning in 1994, which emphasizes hands-on and collaborative problem solving as a way of learning. Modernization in the instruction of physics will complement and balance recent advances in the experimentally-based study of biology and chemistry attained by the recent addition of modern equipment and laboratory experiences in these areas."

While the classical theory of dissipative functions is highly developed, the theory of quantum dissipation is not well understood, especially in the presence of strong interactions with the surroundings. The present collaboration will answer many current questions in the field by studying a large class of generalized models of quantum dissipation.

16.932502,"This proposal from Columbia University requests support for the U.S. ATLAS Research Program. The ATLAS detector is currently under construction for operation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland with initial data taking scheduled for 2007. The U.S. ATLAS Program aims at providing U.S. university scientists, teams of faculty, postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, with the opportunity to maximize the science from the LHC accelerator. The goal of the Program is to provide a broad based understanding of the physical origin of mass, and how it relates to our other concepts about the material universe. The new particles that may well be found at the LHC are important not only for extending unknown dimensions of the physics of elementary particles, but also for understanding key issues in cosmology. Answers to these questions would provide a major advance toward completing a unified view of the particles in nature, the forces with which particles interact, and their role in the past and future of our universe. This is a time when there are unusually compelling indications that the step taken by the LHC, leading to collision energies far beyond those available at existing facilities, will lead to especially important discoveries with implications over a broad field of fundamental science. This proposal rests on the especially strong scientific case for investigating this new energy regime and benefits from a program in which the international community is providing a major part of the investment. The Research Program will include the technical effort associated with maintenance and operation of the detector. A second element of the program is in the area of information technology, software and computing, which will play a crucial role in allowing scientists at U.S. universities to fully exploit the potential of the LHC. The program also includes R&D for detector upgrades, which will be needed to maximize the physics output during the long period of running expected for the LHC. <br/><br/>The NSF-ATLAS groups continue to expand their education and outreach programs, with a particular focus on high school teachers and students (closely coordinated with QuarkNet), and on outreach to traditionally under-represented populations. The U.S. ATLAS group plans on strengthening and expanding their outreach efforts in the run-up to ATLAS data taking and, in this proposal, they describe some ideas for extending their program reach beyond the U.S."
0.305565,"This is a research in the field of algebraic geometry. The project fuses techniques from geometry and quantum field theory to unravel the hidden complexity of algebraic singularities, to extract new enumerative invariants of varieties, and to construct novel dualities in representation theory. Five problems will be studied. The first one aims to construct new algebraic invariants of moduli spaces and of symplectic singularities. The building and computation of these invariants requires a theoretical development of the formalism of shifted symplectic structures in non-commutative geometry. In the second project a new method is proposed for constructing motivic enumerative invariants by shifted quantization of the moduli of objects in differential graded categories of Calabi-Yau type. The third project analyzes the way in which non-commutative Hodge theory controls the deformations of Landau-Ginzburg models and proposes a very general unobstructedness theorem. The fourth project gives a strategy for reformulating and proving the classical limit Langlands duality as a purely topological duality for perverse sheaves. The last project will establish the functoriality of the ramified and the twisted non-abelian Hodge correspondences.<br/><br/>The resolution of these questions will consolidate and demystify several existing quantization schemes in geometry, symplectic topology, and field theory. The project sets the stage for understanding the basic structure of algebraic varieties in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of applications. Aside from the natural applications to algebraic topology, the work proposed will be immediately relevant to deep questions in category theory, geometric representation theory, the theory of integrable systems, string theory, gauge theory, quantum gravity and cosmology. The project outlines concrete cross-discipline applications to the physics of mirror symmetry, renormalization group flow, and the quantization of gauge theories. This project also aims to organize a concentrated effort on enhancing and building a new geometric arsenal of techniques applicable to the theory of algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics. This will be achieved by training a group of young researchers, and graduate students in mathematics and physics, and by a curriculum development of a course on derived symplectic geometry, and a course on non-commutative Hodge theory. Specific research opportunities on the interface of geometry and string theory for graduate students and postdocs are discussed. The proposed work will be disseminated through talks at multidisciplinary conferences, research seminars and publications in peer reviewed scientific journals."
0.35,"Modern research in the physical sciences involves the use of non-standard aggregate data objects (for example, images, spectra, or hurricane tracks), which are not directly amenable to traditional statistical methods. Naturally, the physical processes that generated these observed data are also often very complicated. Typically the only meaningful ""model"" is in the form of a high-resolution theoretical or simulation model. For example in cosmology, scientists regularly use large hydrodynamic simulations to understand how the universe formed and evolved. The goal of this project is to develop a new means of combining careful statistical modeling of scientific phenomena with scalable procedures that fully exploit the richness of large collections of complex data without reducing the data to a set of features or templates.<br/><br/>Building on ideas from harmonic analysis and spectral methods, this project is to develop flexible and adaptive nonparametric methods for high-dimensional inference that exploit sparse (and potentially nonlinear) structure in complex data. These methods derive Fourier-like bases that adapt to the intrinsic geometry (e.g., submanifold structure) of the underlying data distribution, and use the empirical basis functions to estimate functions on high-dimensional aggregate objects. The methods go beyond point-estimates in prediction to nonparametric estimation of conditional densities, density ratios and likelihoods of complex, high-dimensional data. A key application of these methods is the calibration of complex simulation models: the inference challenge of determining the settings of input values to these models so that their output approximates either real data or the output of a more complex and computationally-intensive simulation code. On a broader scale, this work will make key methodological contributions to building, interpreting, and using probability models for high-dimensional, complexly-structured data in a wide range of scientific applications."
0.015,"Last year, antihydrogen was trapped for the first time by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN. By this point hundreds of antiatoms have been trapped for times as long as 1000 s. While this was a remarkable achievement, the ALPHA apparatus is not well configured for most measurements of the properties of antihydrogen, and must be rebuilt to allow laser and better microwave access. Furthermore, the trapping rates, while sufficient to begin studies of the properties of antimatter, are lower than optimal. There are two broad challenges to improving the trapping rate: (1) Understanding the behavior of the positron and antiproton plasmas from which the antihydrogen is synthesized; and (2) Understanding the atomic processes by which positrons and antiprotons recombine. Antihydrogen synthesis lies on the boundary between atomic and plasma physics, and cannot be studied properly without employing tools from both fields. The long term goal of antihydrogen research is to search for differences between the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences might occur between the spectra of the two species. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. Another place differences might occur is in the gravitational interactions of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences could solve the baryogenesis problem. A third area of potential difference is in the fractional charge of antihydrogen. The net charge of antihydrogen is only known to about 10^-7 relative to the unit charge. Positive results from any of these measurements would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. <br/><br/>The long-¬term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-¬antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. The trapping of antihydrogen last year was extraordinarily widely noted in the lay and scientific press. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The proposed research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups."

0.156,"Mathematically, this research project lies in the field of algebraic geometry. The fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is the study and classification of geometric objects given by solutions to polynomial equations. This research project focuses more specifically on the application of the tools and techniques used in algebraic geometry to study equations arising from algebraic number theory. The study of such equations has a rich history and can be traced back to Diophantus, who first studied solutions to what are today called Diophantine equations. Because of their diversity, the study of such equations has led to numerous applications in fields such as biology, chemistry, cosmology, and computer encryption. The general strategy towards classification of such arithmetic objects is to associate various invariants to the given geometric objects. One example of such an invariant is a set of complex numbers, usually known as periods, associated to a given polynomial system. A central focus of this research project to study which complex numbers can arise as periods of various objects appearing in algebraic geometry. The project also contributes to the training of the next generation of researchers by engaging postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>In this project, the principal investigator intends to study periods arising from the theory of algebraic varieties. The study of periods is in fact a shadow of some foundational questions in the theory of motives and algebraic cycles. The PI intends to pursue three broad projects dealing with such questions. In the first project, The PI studies periods of vector bundles with connections. Periods arise when the rational structures on two different cohomology groups are compared. This project attempts to generalize to higher dimensions results on the periods of irregular connections in the case of curves. The second project deals with giving explicit constructions of mixed Tate motives. In previous work, the PI constructed such motives from the higher homotopy of algebraic varieties. An explicit outcome of this project will be to compute the periods and Galois modules coming from these higher homotopy motives. In addition to these projects, the PI also plans to use K-theory to study the deformation theory of algebraic cycles as well as the behavior of algebraic cycles under extension of base fields. The last project attempts to apply methods in algebraic geometry to the study of infinite dimensional representations of certain p-adic algebraic groups, and is an excellent example of an application of algebraic geometry to other areas of mathematics."
0.076,"9706910 Hsu This research proposal forms an integral part of the Principal Investigator's program of studying analytical properties of (nonflat) finite or infinite dimensional spaces (mainly Riemannian manifolds and path and loop spaces over them) by analytic and probabilistic methods. The PIs long range goal for the program is to establish a complete analytical and probabilistic theory of path and loop spaces over Riemannian manifolds, whose counterpart in (flat) Euclidean space (finite or infinite dimensional) has been known for quite some time. Successes in these efforts will contribute significantly towards our general understanding of nonlinear infinite dimensional spaces. For the analytical part, the PI will concentrate his research on further developing analytic techniques subsumed under the name ""Malliavin Calculus."" In particular for the period covered in this proposal, the PI will spend a substantial amount of his research resources on the equivalence of various Sobolev norms (the so-called Meyer's equivalent problem) and on the spectral properties of the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. For the probabilistic part, the PI intends to launch a detailed study of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process through sample path, especially the effect of curvature on short-time and long-time behaviors of the process. The models under study, path and loop spaces over such geometric structures such as spheres, ellipsoids, and tori, have been used extensively in recent years in the theory of relativity, quantum physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The Principal Investigator will study these models by both traditional analytical methods and the more recent methods of probability theory. Specifically he will investigate both long-time and short-time behavior of a specific random process on path and loop spaces in the hope that it will reveal geometric properties which can be applied by theoretical scientists and engineers in their respective disciplines."

The Cabreras and Caldwell groups are supported by the DOE High Energy Physics program. This unique low temperature facility will be built to operate large-mass cryogenic particle detectors for research on dark matter and neutrino physics experiments, and for investigating industrial applications. Under the coordination of CfPA, the groups from these three institutions, along with research personnel from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), Santa Clara University and the Institute for Nuclear Research (INR) in Baksan, Russia are performing a search for the dark matter that makes up at least 90% of the mass of the universe. This problem is one of the most important in cosmology and science today and is the central theme of the CfPA. Our team is looking for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) such as supersymmetric particles, which may constitute this dark matter. We are expecting to improve the sensitivity of the previous searches by more than a hundred times within a few years using novel detectors which operate at very low temperature. By simultaneously measuring the ionization and lattice vibrations created by particle interactions within crystals, we obtain an unparalleled rejection tool against ubiquitous radioactive backgrounds which have limited previous experiments.

Energetic streams of hot plasma appear to be expelled from the galactic cores at speeds approaching the speed of light. When those streams plow into the diffuse plasma surrounding the galaxy the interacting regions produce relativistic electrons and become illuminated. Those structures are known as Radio Galaxies and they not only emit radiation at radio wavelengths but also in the optical and x-ray regions. For the first time, new observational capabilities will enable us to directly compare radio and X-ray emissions produced by the same electron populations. The radio emissions are a consequence of weak magnetic fields pervading the interaction regions, while the signature X-rays result from collisions between those electrons and photons in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Simultaneous measurements of both is necessary to find measures of the strengths of the magnetic fields and the properties of the electron populations. That information, in turn is crucial input into efforts to infer the dynamical events leading to the radio structures. <br/>The investigators are in position to carry out highly sophisticated numerical simulations of these objects, studying both the relationships between the energetics of the plasma flows and the emissions that can be observed from earth.

The aim is an accuracy of; one part in 1018. The best ""accuracy"" and 1000-day stability realized in the past is 1013 or 105 less. The new ""accuracy"" would mean that independent frequency measurements on the same atomic line by two different groups in the same laboratory agree to better than 1018 and long term (108 sec or 1000 days) stability is as good. This would have numerous implications for measurements in fundamental physics and cosmology. The precision of current atomic clocks is already being strained by the extraordinarily high timing stability of the millisecond pulsars and the needs of space missions. The mass loss of other pulsars due to gravitational radiation could not have been observed without precise atomic clocks. Closer to home the Global Positioning System relies crucially on precise atomic clocks. There seems to be an unlimited field of new applications in metrology as more and more measuring tasks are reduced to precise frequency measurement."
0.188395,"FRG<br/><br/>Geometric Function Theory is a broad area of mathematics that has its roots in the classical theory of analytic functions of one complex variable. From the very beginning this field has had connections to potential theory, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, and geometric topology. The second half of the twentieth century brought about new areas like quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, with links to nonlinear PDEs and harmonic analysis. The research group is planning to tackle some of the most important open problems in this broadly construed field by using our diverse strengths. Examples of the problems include understanding the integrability properties of derivatives of conformal mappings, finding criteria for recognizing metric spaces up to bi-Lipschitz or quasiconformal equivalence, further developing the theory of holomorphic curves and its quasiregular generalizations, and investigating algebraic conditions related to quasiconvexity of energy functionals. The intellectual merit of our activity will be found in a deepened understanding of fundamental questions in Geometric Function Theory, in an increase of the links to other fields of mathematics, and in a broader scope of possible applications.<br/><br/>Core mathematics keeps reappearing outside its own realm with dramatic success and consequences. Recent examples range from cosmology (where deep topological issues arise regarding the proposed new dimensions for the universe) to material science (where deformation of elastic bodies are studied by methods of the Calculus of Variations) to engineering (where function theoretic methods have led to advances in control theory). The latter two examples are directly connected with the work of our research group, as are topological issues pertaining to the geometry of three dimensional spaces. Another new feature with possible far reaching reverberations is to use function theoretic methods in studying spaces that are not smooth in the classical sense; such spaces naturally occur when Riemannian structures degenerate and form singularities. The main strength of our group is that its members have common roots, but multifarious interests, so as to make advancement in and connections between separate fields. The broader impact of our activity will be the education of new scholars who understand the methods and techniques in the field, and who know how to find applications of their knowledge to other parts of mathematics and sciences. We will put great weight on passing on the important questions to the younger generation and on enabling them to perform independent research."

0.01,"Conference: Nonlinear PDEs, Numerical Analysis, and Applications, October 2-3, 2015, University of Pittsburgh. Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a key role in the understanding, simulation and prediction of various phenomena occurring in the sciences and engineering. Yet even for simple problems, exact mathematical solutions are unattainable, and computational methods are necessary to construct approximate solutions. Therefore there is a critical need to develop numerical methods and to theoretically justify the quality and reliability of the resulting approximations. In addition to providing justification of the numerical methods, the theoretical analysis often gives insight for the development of new methods with improved efficiency, accuracy and capabilities. This two-day conference will create a forum for junior and senior researchers to discuss cutting-edge results and applications of numerical methods for nonlinear PDEs. The aim of the conference is to provide an informal setting in which young researchers and leading experts in numerical analysis can meet, collaborate, and develop new ideas. In addition, the conference will expose graduate students and postdocs on this active field of numerical PDEs.<br/><br/>The construction, implementation, and analysis of computational methods for fully nonlinear second order partial differential equations are relatively new, yet critical research areas in numerical analysis and scientific computing. Such problems arise in many application areas including meteorology, cosmology, geometric optics, differential geometry, optimal transport, economics, imagine processing and mesh generation. These problems constitute one of the most difficult classes of PDEs to approximate numerically, and breakthroughs in their discretization have only appeared within the last 15 years. While there have been several advances in numerical fully nonlinear second order PDEs, there still remain fundamental challenges that need to be properly addressed. Examples include the construction of nonlinear Galerkin methods with monotonicity properties under realistic mesh conditions, robust numerical methods for general families of nonlinear problems, imposition of non-standard boundary conditions, and fast solvers of the resulting non-linear algebraic systems. This conference will gather leaders in the field to discuss state-of-the-art research trends and directions of future research."
0.22,"Motivated by considerations in topology, geometry, arithmetic and<br/>group theory the proposal intends to study real, complex and<br/>quaternionic hyperbolic manifolds. This will involve the study of<br/>discrete groups, and their connections with other research active areas; for<br/>example number theory, and the theory of expanding<br/>graphs. We will also explore various interconnections between these<br/>geometric objects. This has been fruitful in the past, <br/>since previous work has shown how an understanding of higher dimensional<br/>hyperbolic manifolds can impact the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>The proposal seeks to further understand basic objects in modern<br/>geometry and topology, namely manifolds that admit a hyperbolic metric<br/>of some type. Many of the problems in the proposal are<br/>cross-disciplinary, and are amenable to study using a broad spectrum<br/>of mathematical technqiues; for example from number theory, geometry,<br/>topology and group theory.<br/>By their nature, progress and solutions to problems in the proposal<br/>will have a broader impact. The problems suggested have applications<br/>in fields as diverse as number theory (class numbers) and cosmology<br/>(and its relation to the topology of 4-dimensional hyperbolic<br/>manifolds) and computer science (expanding graphs). All of these have<br/>the potential to be fertile grounds for the education of graduate<br/>students."

Hydrogen and helium were formed in the Big Bang, but heavier elements were produced by stars during the evolution of our galaxy and others.

The process of chemical enrichment by dying stars has a random character, and fluctuations in the abundance of chemical elements occur from one place to the next. Observations<br/>of abundance differences among stars and interstellar gas clouds are becoming available, but there has been relatively little theoretical effort to interpret them.

0.126841,"Pavlovi'c plans to gain better understanding of fluid and nonlinear wave and dispersive equations<br/>via analyzing dispersive equations using harmonic analysis techniques that turned out to be useful<br/>in the context of fluid equations and vice verse. The first group of proposed problems focuses on<br/>the Navier-Stokes equations that describe fundamental properties of viscous fluids. One approach<br/>in studying existence of solutions to the Navier-Stokes is to obtain solutions to the corresponding<br/>integral equation. Existence of these solutions in 3D has been proved only locally in time and<br/>globally for small initial data. Hence it is important to understand behavior of these solutions in<br/>""critical spaces"" that preserve scaling invariance. With her collaborators the PI will investigate the<br/>behavior of solutions to the Navier-stokes equations in critical spaces. Questions of interest include<br/>stability of self-similar solutions in critical spaces (which is motivated by the analogy with solitons<br/>in the context of dispersive equations) and a long standing open problem related to well-posedness<br/>of the Navier-Stokes equations in the largest critical space. The second group of proposed problems<br/>concentrates on nonlinear dispersive equations. Many of the important structural properties<br/>(e.g. conserved or monotone quantities) of the nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS) are at low<br/>regularities, and to exploit these features one needs to establish existence theory at low regularities.<br/>Pavlovi'c proposes to continue her work on establishing global well-posedness for certain class of<br/>NLS equations corresponding to low regularity data. The PI will employ and further investigate<br/>tools that were useful in recent advances in the field, such as interaction Morawetz estimates.<br/>The third group of problems is related to super-critical nonlinear wave and NLS equations. Here<br/>super-critical refers to equations with conserved quantities at lower regularities than the scaling<br/>invariant norm (the 3D Navier-Stokes is an example). Motivated by her earlier work with Katz<br/>on partial regularity of the Navier-Stokes equations, Pavlovi'c proposes to use microlocalization<br/>techniques in order to obtain a partial regularity result for super-critical NLS and wave equations.<br/>Suggested problems involve important mathematical questions such as existence and regularity<br/>of solutions to nonlinear PDEs that describe motion of fluid or various wave phenomena. For<br/>instance, the theory of the Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions is far from being complete.<br/>The outstanding open problems, whose better understanding would have impact in the fields from<br/>oceanography to cosmology, are global existence, uniqueness and regularity of smooth solutions to<br/>the Navier-Stokes in 3D. On the other hand, the NLS and their combinations with the Kortewegde-<br/>Vries and wave equations have been proposed as models for many basic wave phenomena.<br/>Such a physical relevance of the equations motivates mathematical explorations. The proposed<br/>activity seeks to find an interdisciplinary approach to questions arising from fluid and dispersive<br/>PDEs. In particular, the PI plans to analyze dispersive equations using sophisticated techniques<br/>of harmonic analysis that turned out to be useful in the context of fluid equations and vice verse."
0.398054,"AST-0708795<br/>Bromm<br/><br/>Massive black holes (MBHs) are ubiquitous in luminous galaxies, and their mass is correlated with the properties of the host galaxy. It is therefore plausible that MBHs played an important role in the formation of structure in the Universe. This project will study the early coevolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, at the end of the cosmic dark ages. The research will examine key physical processes, including the hierarchical merging of dark matter halos; heating, cooling, and gas inflow inside the first HII regions; how to establish steady accretion onto the first black holes; global angular-momentum-transporting gravitational instabilities; the onset of fragmentation and star formation; establishing the first multiphase dusty interstellar medium; radiative and mechanical launching of winds and outflows; and the merging of smaller black holes into larger ones. These processes are complex and involve multiple physical scales, so large-scale numerical simulations will be developed to accompany the analytical methods being used. In order to pay careful attention to numerical accuracy and systematics, those simulations will use multiple methods, including smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, grid-based hydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement, and appropriate radiation transfer and sink-particle stellar dynamics. The results will address some of the key open questions in cosmology, including how the first galaxies formed, whether the MBH or the host stellar system came first, and when was the tight correlation between MBHs and hosts established in different environments?<br/><br/>Because this research addresses the observable spectral properties of the first objects, it will be a valuable guide for astronomical searches with the next-generation of infrared facilities. It will also help to reduce theoretical uncertainties in estimates of low-frequency gravitational radiation bursts. Involved graduate and undergraduate students will learn cutting-edge methodologies with many and varied applications. Unprecedented animations of the first galaxies and early black hole accretion flows will be used in teaching and to disseminate knowledge about one of the least well-understood epochs in the evolution of structure in the Universe.

0.027725,"AST-0086683<br/>Edward L. Robinson<br/><br/>This is a collaborative research project with William F. Welsh at San Diego State University (AST0086692). This project will use the 9m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra of QSO broad line regions, with good time sampling, to analyze changes in the full kinematic spectral profiles as a function of time. These will be used to test different kinematic QSO models ( inflow vs. outflow) for the broad line emission regions.<br/><br/>Lurking at the center of many massive galaxies are supermassive Black Holes (BH). If there is material nearby, the BH will trap and accrete this matter releasing a huge amount of energy which will show up as increased luminosity of the galaxy nucleus. Galaxies which possess such an accreting BH are said to have an ""active Nucleus"" (AGN). Accretion is an inherently unstable process. The accretion region close to the BH is called the Broad Line Region (BLR). The BLR is luminous because it is photoionized by the hard (UV and x-ray) continuum flux produced very close to the BH. Because this ionizing radiation is variable, so is the BLR. Thus the emission lines from the BLR ""echo"" the variations in the continuum flux. Using these ""echoes"" structures near the BH with microarcsecond scales can be mapped. To do this one needs a very long time baseline of well-sampled observations of the variations in the BLR. This requires data over weeks or months. The ""HET Echo Mapping Project"" is a new research project which aims to: (1) Map the size, geometry, and flow of the BLR gas. (2) Make direct estimates of the mass of the central BH using the geometry and kinematics of the BLR. (3) map AGN with BH of 10 to 100 times the mass of those previously measured. (4) Measure the parameters of any accretion wind and the temporal changes in the BLR.

0.128064,"Proposal: DMS-9971705<br/><br/>Principal Investigator: Alan Reid<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with the structure of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds. Our interests are in so-called hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. In dimension 3 some of our main aims are to study the existence and properties of certain surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Other parts of the proposal deal with interactions between number theory and algebra with hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Previous work has shown how certain invariants arising from algebraic data associated to a hyperbolic 3-manifold are related to the geometry and topology of the 3-manifold. In dimension 4 we will explore constructions of hyperbolic 4- manifolds and how 3-dimensional manifolds can immerse in them. This is closely connected to problems in cosmology.<br/><br/>Manifolds are fundamental objects which appear naturally in many places in mathematics and physics. At present the study of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds and the interplay between them is fundamental. For example, recently, the theory of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds modeled on hyperbolic spaces has become central to understanding the spatial geometry of the Universe. Our work hopes to reveal more about these spaces. A major tool that we use in our studies comes from number theory. As in the case of the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem, the interaction between number theory and our hyperbolic spaces is significant. It is our intention to explore these connections."

The data are already publicly available for both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and UKIDSS. The Dark Energy Survey is scheduled to begin survey operations in 2012. Dr. Willman will also use N-body and N-body + SPH simulations to explore a possible new method to ""see"" purely dark sub-halos. She will investigate the merging histories of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxies and possible observational signatures thereof. This work provides a direct approach to astronomically measure the properties of dark matter on the smallest possible sub-galactic scales - a major problem facing observational cosmology.

0.359979,"This project will study problems that occur in the design of computer and physical experiments and the analysis of their output. Physical experiments are the gold standard for measuring input-output relationships but these measurements that contain noise and possibly unrecognized sources of bias. Computer codes that model input-output relationships are used increasingly in place of, or in conjunction with, physical experiments because of they can provide decreased lead times in the engineering design of manufactured goods as well as for the assessment of designs in varying field-use conditions and varying conditions of fabrication. In general a deeper understanding of product and process performance can be made by using a combination of computer and physical experiments. However, computer codes provide a biased measurement of input-output relationships because of the inevitably inadequate physics or biology used in their development. This proposal will address the following problems that arise from the challenges sketched above. 1. To increase the computational efficiency of screening methodology for identifying the most important inputs to a computer code. 2. To develop methodology for estimating the upper (or lower) percentile of a computer code output with respect to the distributionof the field inputs. 3. To estimate the set of Pareto optimal input values for multivariate computer output and the corresponding Pareto Frontier of output vectors corresponding to the Pareto optimal inputs. 4. To develop statistical methodology for simultaneous determination of calibration<br/>parameters and tuning inputs for computer models, including those with mixed quantitative and qualitative inputs.<br/><br/>Experimental modeling using computer codes is increasingly prevalent in engineering, in biomechanics, in the physical sciences, in the life sciences, in economics, and other areas of natural science such as the assessment of climate change and cosmology. Over the past twenty years, the use of computer codes as experimental tools has become increasingly sophisticated due to the fact that the number of inputs to such codes has steadily increased as well as the level of detail embodied by the codes. Researchers can now vary both ``engineering'' inputs as well as inputs that describe the operating conditions in the model. In addition, more detailed mathematical models of the input-output relationship as well as more accurate numerical solution of these models often produce codes that require 5-24 hours for a single run. In addition, multiple codes are often used to describe different aspects of the phenomenon being studied. This project will study problems that occur in the design of experiments involving such computer codes including screening the important inputs to such codes to determine important inputs, the efficient use of code output for optimization and other problems, and the calibration of corresponding physical experiments to further improve their prediction accuracy."

Research on water quality is motivated by the state?s prioritization of management of water resources. An interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in biology, ecology, environmental engineering, chemistry, and geology will develop analytical facilities and expertise through the Appalachian Freshwater Initiative (AFI) to understand and detect ecological and biological impacts of complex mixtures of contaminants in water under varying climate change scenarios. Research on GW detection will take advantage of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, WV. This team, consisting of astrophysicists and engineers, will build the physical and human infrastructure necessary for researchers to directly detect and characterize gravitational waves. The project will broaden participation of minorities and females in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professions through continuing education workshops and scholarships. Public engagement will occur through citizen science efforts, as well as museum and planetarium displays and programs.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>The freshwater quality research focuses on detecting novel and dilute contaminants and pathogens, understanding the complex chemical interactions and pathogen characteristics, predicting contaminant transport, toxicity, and degradation pathways, and understanding how climate-related changes in precipitation regimes affect biological communities. The group will develop rapid, sensitive, low-cost sensors for contaminants and pathogens that have the potential to impact aquatic ecosystems and the freshwater supply. Researchers will work to understand the sub-lethal, chronic, and cumulative effects of the chemical, biological, and physical contaminants in Appalachian streams and rivers. In addition, the group will model effects of multi-contaminant mixtures on ecological communities. Detection of GWs and the characterization of GW sources will allow studies ranging from early universe cosmology to formation and evolution of galaxies to populations of compact objects in the local universe to tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. The sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays to nanoHertz frequency gravitational waves emitted by supermassive black-hole binaries will be enhanced through addition of more millisecond pulsars to the array, development of improved algorithms for characterization of pulsars, better understanding of the source populations, and improvements in the sensitivity and efficiency of algorithms for detecting GW signatures."
0.042,"Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include analyses of possible Higgs particle signals at future colliders, studies of the interactions between photons and neutrinos in situations of astrophysical interest, and investigations of the utility and validity of `effective field theories` intended for the simplified treatment of low-energy reactions.

Photons and neutrinos only interact appreciably under extreme conditions such as those found in the early universe or in compact astrophysical objects. It is important to determine if this interaction alters our view of such things as the relic neutrinos in cosmology or the way in which heavy objects loose energy.

Its development draws algorithmic techniques from classical nonlinear programming and is nurtured by the development in many other areas of data science. Today, the size, complexity, and diversity of instances have grown significantly. The proposed research addresses these new challenges in the following directions: data and variable splitting for handling multiple regularizers and for parallel and distributed optimization, efficient model path computation and regularization parameter selection, stochastic approximation, and coordinate descent methods for non-convex optimization. These investigations are expected to significantly reduce the running times of the existing algorithms, giving rise to novel algorithms to enable the solutions of a wide ranges of problems that are currently not solvable in data sciences. In particular, the expected results will fit machine learning models to data previously inaccessible (e.g., distributed data), enable the mining of data in much higher dimensions and across different modalities, as well as handle multiple regularizers in a computationally tractable way.<br/><br/>Technological advances in data gathering have led to a rapid proliferation of big data in diverse areas such as the Internet, engineering, climate studies, cosmology, and medicine. In order for this massive amount of data to make sense, new computational approaches are being introduced to let scientists and engineers analyze their data. Among these approaches, sparse optimization and structured solutions have grown enormously important. Today, their scopes are quickly expanding. Beyond the sensing and processing of 1D signals and 2D images, high-dimensional quantities such as 3D video, 4D CT, and multi-way tensors have become the data or unknown variables in models. Beyond the sparsity structure, structures such as low-rankness, sparse graph, tree structure, linear representation of a few dictionary atoms, as well as their combinations, have debut as desired structures in various applications including genome mapping, protein structure study, social network analysis, stock price prediction, and text/speech mining. The proposed research will build on the recent successes and lead to new techniques for handling large-sized, diverse-typed data and variables, novel algorithms for pursuing a variety of structures in solutions, the extension of existing numerical methods to parallel and decentralized computing architectures, and the contributions to solving key problems in several aforementioned application areas."
0.429242,"The global theory of minimal surfaces in space is in a phase of<br/>explosive growth. Many new methods of constructing complete<br/>embedded minimal surfaces have recently been found; in place of a<br/>dearth of examples just a few years ago, we now have a quite<br/>varied collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A<br/>basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them<br/>into families with common properties and understood<br/>limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that<br/>combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of<br/>geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,<br/>notably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will<br/>attack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one<br/>heliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk<br/>surface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes? Of<br/>what families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same<br/>time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal<br/>surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass<br/>representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully<br/>documented, and useful as a research tool.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to<br/>biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;<br/>indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their<br/>foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some<br/>or several of its features in the expression we witness. At its<br/>base, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we<br/>search for principles in science that can be formulated as<br/>extremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of<br/>optimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation. This<br/>leaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions<br/>of that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in<br/>physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,<br/>the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating<br/>droplets and soap films by F.

UNDERGROUND PHYSICS<br/><br/>TITLE: Collaborative Proposal: The XENON Dark Matter Project: Construction and Underground Operation of a 100 kg Detector <br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The discovery of dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics. Despite the extreme challenges, the search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) believed to constitute the dark matter, continues with accelerator, space and underground based experiments. Ultimately, only astrophysical observations can determine whether WIMPs exist in nature, but the importance of direct detection of WIMP-nucleus scattering in laboratory experiments is well recognized. The US is in a world-leading position in direct detection; however, better-sensitivity experiments with sizeable increase in target mass and sophisticated background rejection schemes are key to future progress and discovery. <br/><br/>This award provides support to the Columbia and Rice groups for their continuation of the XENON Dark Matter Program, with the construction of a 100 kg fiducial mass detector (XENON100). The sensitivity goal is 2x10^45 cm^2. This is achieved through background discrimination provided by the simultaneous detection of ionization and scintillation signals in pure liquid xenon. XENON100 is built on the design and technology established with the XENON10 prototype, with a factor of ~10 increase in total Xe mass. XENON100 is an experiment that can be built with minimum risk, giving first physics results by 2009, when the LHC will be searching for Supersymmetric dark matter. <br/><br/>Among the Broader Impacts of this work, the XENON science has all the ingredients to captivate the interest and imagination of students and the general public alike. XENON technical-related work can impact society in a number of ways. The liquid xenon imaging detector technology is a prime candidate for applications in several fields outside particle astrophysics, including national security and medical imaging research."
0.07315,"The two investigators will study a variety of geometric structures which have their origins in mathematical physics as well as complex geometry. These include projective algebraic manifolds, complex manifolds, quaternionic Kahler manifolds, and supermanifolds. The investigation will include a study of the momentum mapping in connection with quaternionic Kahler reduction, self-dual manifolds, and the twistor representation of quaternionic Kahler structures. The dynamics of the static self- dual solutions of the two-dimensional Yang-Mills-Higgs equations will be studied with the use of a computer. The two investigators will continue their studies of the new ""supergeometry"" which was created as part of gauge theory to understand the relationship between cosmology and subatomic physics. One will continue his work on the twistor geometries in Nigel Hitchin's framework. The second will use ""quaternionic quotients"" to derive further knowledge of complete noncompact manifolds with unusual spin holonomy. This last is a property of foliations and measures their shearing tendencies."
0.147994,"AST 0098253<br/>Hough<br/><br/>The principal objective of this project is to extend and expand a high-resolution radio study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that will make major contributions to our understanding of the physics of relativistic jets in these objects and, in the process, shed light on unified models of active<br/>galaxies. Active galaxies, including quasars and radio galaxies, most likely harbor supermassive black holes in their central regions that are ultimately responsible for the intense, episodic emission the nuclei of these galaxies exhibit. By electromagnetic processes which are still not well understood, material is accelerated in the vicinity of the black hole and channeled into<br/>jets that travel outward near the speed of light. Physical models of jets generally predict that their observed properties will strongly depend on the orientation of the jet axis to our line of sight<br/>from Earth. Thus to perform statistical tests of these models, extended radio sources covering a very wide range in orientation will be studied. Radio telescopes will be used to image the jets in these objects on scales from light-years up to millions of light-years; the images will be used to look for systematic trends in the jet structures as a function of orientation angle, to determine the statistical distribution of apparent faster-than-light, or ""superluminal"", jet speeds and to follow the trajectories of the relativistic outflows. Observations will also be used to determine physical conditions in the jets and to map their magnetic fields, Several undergraduates - from both Trinity University and the Alamo Community College District - will be direct participants in this research. This will enhance their preparation for graduate study and offer students from underrepresented groups the opportunity to do science as they consider career options in the physical sciences.<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"
0.118959,"A broad range of observations -- from galaxies and superclusters to distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation -- tell us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of cryogenic phonon-mediated devices to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, they have operated for four years the CDMS-II experiment with 30 detectors deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, and obtained the best limit worldwide at high WIMP masses. This award will fund the base program of this group to focus primarily on detector characterization and optimization, rapid-turnaround initial cryogenic screening of full-scale CDMS production detectors, rapid-turnaround Tc-testing of tungsten film samples from the detector production line, detector fabrication support, collaborative work with scientists and technical staff at new CDMS detector fabrication and substrate polishing facilities, and assistance with CDMS-related materials analysis. <br/><br/>Not only are its scientific results important for astrophysics and particle physics, but its technological development will also push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, whose applications are increasingly widespread. In addition to working with students from Santa Clara University (SCU), an undergraduate institution, the PI actively mentors undergraduates, graduate students and junior research staff at other CDMS institutions. The close proximity of SCU to Stanford, UC Berkeley and SLAC makes close collaborations with these groups particularly easy - and tremendously beneficial to SCU students. Lastly, the SCU group does some outreach with K-12 students in the San Francisco Bay Area and supports the public outreach program at Soudan as part of the SuperCDMS collaboration."
0.73,"This award will support a program of research in neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD). The observation of such decays would indicate that neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. they are their own anti-particles. The rate of the process is sensitive to the effective neutrino mass. Determining whether neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac particles and measuring their masses are among the highest priorities in neutrino physics, as was pointed out in the APS Multi-Divisional Neutrino Study. The answer will also have important implications for astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>This project has two complementary parts. First is the development of the next-generation CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) detector, including the operations of the first production tower (CUORE-0) and the subsequent data analysis. CUORE promises to be one of the most sensitive NDBD experiments in the next decade. It will be sensitive to the neutrino mass values suggested by recent atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments in the so-called inverted mass hierarchy. The second goal is the R&D towards a large generic bolometer-based NDBD detector. They will establish a low-background cryogenic facility near the UC Berkeley campus and start a comprehensive program of bolometric detector development. This long-range program will be geared toward a 1 ton-scale, modular detector.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the program includes providing an educational and research environment for the junior scientists, including graduate and undergraduate students. The bolometric detectors bring together many experimental techniques from low temperature physics, solid-state physics, and particle and nuclear physics. The implications from observations in neutrino experiments have broad impact on the origins of the Universe and it is a subject that sparks the imagination in the general public."
0.101998,"This project concerns the quantum invariants of 3-manifolds and links in them. A main problem is that these invariants are poorly understood from the point of view of topology and geometry. The goal of this project is to make connections between the quantum invariants and the existing knowledge of the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds. The main approach will be an investigation of the large level asymptotic expansion of the quantum invariants of closed 3-manifolds. The idea of studying these asymptotics stems from Witten's work on the quantum invariants. From that work and subsequent work of mathematicians there have emerged some rigorous mathematical conjectures about the geometric content of these asymptotics. These conjectures indicate that the quantum invariants hide deep topological information. The PI plans to check, in collaboration with others, (some of) the conjectures via concrete case studies. E.g., he will jointly with J.E. Andersen continue their project on the surgeries on the figure 8 knot. All but a finite number of these 3-manifolds are hyperbolic and it is the hope that this case study can shed some light on the connection between quantum invariants and hyperbolic geometry. A main question is whether the quantum invariants can detect the volume of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In addition the PI will try to work from a more general point of view, namely he will apply T. Yoshida's new approach to the quantum invariants to try to calculate the asymptotic expansion of the invariants for all closed 3-manifolds, Yoshida's construction being based on an abelianization of conformal field theory. In that connection the PI will jointly with Yoshida work on proving that Yoshida's invariants coincide with the more well established Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants thereby making a connection to the other approaches to the quantum invariants.<br/><br/>This project tries to develop new techniques to obtain knowledge about the shape (topology) and geometry of low-dimensional objects such as knots and 3-dimensional spaces. A main reason that we should study low-dimensional spaces and their geometry and shape is that nature contains such spaces in many contexts. Thus large molecules, e.g. DNA, have a ""knotted"" structure and newer research points in the direction that one can apply knot invariants to obtain information about such molecules. Certain of their properties depend on their shape, e.g., how they are ""knotted"". Another example is in cosmology where a central question is: What is the ""shape"" of our universe? Here one should think of the fact that when we walk around on the earth it just looks like an ordinary plane but in fact the surface of the earth is like the surface of a very large ball. It is similar with our universe. Locally everything looks flat, i.e., locally our universe looks like a standard 3-dimensional Euclidean space (a 3-dimensional pendant to a plane), but maybe the universe as a whole is something completely different, like a curved compact space. Mathematicians use so-called invariants to detect topological and geometric properties of spaces, e.g., if they are curved like a sphere or not like a plane. The quantum invariants, the theme for this project, is a relatively new family of invariants dating back to V. Jones' discovery of the Jones polynomial in the 80ties."
0.475,"Modern physics is often an exploration of the extreme environments. For example, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN is a particle accelerator that studies what happens when protons collide at extremely high energy, briefly generating conditions that mimic those of the early universe. At the other end of the energy scale, extremely low-energy collisions (at temperatures only tens of billionths of a degree above absolute zero) contribute to the phenomenon of superfluidity, in which a fluid (such as a very dilute gas) flows without any viscosity. Remarkably, the superfluid gas is itself a pristine ""universe,"" hosting its own ""particles"" that can be analogues of those existing (or expected to exist) in the cosmos. One example is a particle known as a magnetic monopole, which has not yet been observed but has recently been simulated in a superfluid. Creating such particle-like analogues permits scientists to study some of the properties of anticipated particles in the universe that would otherwise be completely inaccessible, as their creation would exceed the capabilities of even the most powerful particle accelerators. The research in this project is devoted to creation and study of several particle-like structures, including direct analogues of monopoles and more exotic structures known as ""knots"" and ""merons."" As simulations, they promise additional insight into the fundamental physical processes of our universe; but they are also of interest in their own right as examples of new and, in many cases, completely unexplored physics. The research program also provides training opportunities for highly motivated undergraduates, a postdoctoral researcher, and a secondary school teacher, with whom we will engage and motivate the next generation of scientists and citizens.<br/><br/><br/>Topological structures are central to diverse branches of physics at many different energy and length scales, including cosmology, particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. Superfluids, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, provide new and exciting opportunities to examine these structures in highly-controlled environments. Notably, the complexity of the order parameter describing the superfluid determines what kind of topological excitations it can support. Here, researchers will examine experimentally several aspects of these topological excitations, including quantized vortex dynamics in scalar condensates (total spin F=0) at nonzero temperature, creation of vortex molecules (or ""meron pairs"") in pseudospinor condensates (effective spin F=1/2), and linked field configurations in quantum fields (or ""knots"") in spinor condensates (spin F=1). The excitations will be imprinted by exposing the condensate to time-dependent magnetic and optical fields, and will subsequently be analyzed through examination of atomic density profiles using established imaging techniques. Subsequent studies will study their dynamics and interactions, developing new imaging techniques as required."
0.197243,"The material that fills the vast spaces between galaxies (the Intergalactic Medium, or IGM) is surprisingly poorly understood. One primary method of investigating the IGM is through the light it absorbs from very distant very bright quasi-stellar objects (quasars), which show hundreds of measurable features at very specific wavelengths. Unfortunately, detailed computational work is still unable to reproduce key aspects of the IGM, all at the same time and using the same input parameters. This must mean that those simulations do not correctly represent the real Universe. This study attempts to correct this failing with a systematic investigation of the physics included in the numerical studies, and a rigorous delineation of the valid regions of the large parameter space to be investigated.<br/><br/>The IGM makes hundreds of absorption lines in quasar spectra that are sensitive to the thermal history of the Universe, but, as noted, current numerical simulations cannot simultaneously match several key features. The discrepancy is too large to be due to observational errors, and is seen in multiple comparisons even when using different numerical methods. This research team has decades of experience observing the IGM and running high fidelity simulations, and is forced to conclude that the simulations simply do not correctly represent our Universe. Therefore, this project will search for a realistic representation of the IGM through four new types of simulation, including a new radiation transport solver, a high resolution large box simulation with parameterized feedback, the first ever simulation of the IGM with self-consistent 3D radiative transfer, and physically motivated simulations that explore a wide variety of other possible heat sources. All these results will be synthesized, parameterizing precisely how they change the appearance of the IGM, so as to select those parameter values that will faithfully generate observations of the IGM. The work should locate what is missing from our understanding of the IGM, and discover and specify simulations that can exactly reproduce the main physical processes in the IGM. It will lead to more accurate and robust estimates of the IGM temperature, density and ionization, the intensity of the ultraviolet background radiation, and the clustering of matter on small scales that is used to set limits on neutrino masses. <br/><br/>All of the simulations and the generating codes will be publicly available. This team has a two decade record of integrating education and diversity into their core research. Undergraduate students will receive instruction in cosmology, astrophysics, spectroscopy, and simulations, and they will work with advanced software tools."

1.6,"This proposal will fund the search for neutrino-less double beta decay. The neutrinos are fundamental particles that play key roles in the early universe, in cosmology and astrophysics, and in nuclear and particle physics. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. A 1-tonne detector searching for neutrino-less double beta-decay will be about 100 times more sensitive than current measurements and will confirm or exclude the inverted mass hierarchy for Majorana neutrinos. To achieve the ultimately realizing 1-tonne scale detectors using Ge detectors, the Majorana and GERDA collaborations have established a formal cooperative agreement. The collaborations have agreed to share resources and knowledge in their development of detector designs to reach for a Majorana mass sensitivity below 50 meV. This proposal requests support for the design of a 1-tonne-scale Ge experiment. Work will be performed on the engineering, design, simulation, and risk analysis of an apparatus based on two different concepts, one developed by the Majorana collaboration, and the other by the GERDA collaboration.<br/><br/>The technology of larger, lower-background Ge arrays developed from a tonne-scale neutrino-less double beta decay experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: measurements of anthropogenic radiation in the environment; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport measured via natural isotopic tracers; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities. Students and postdocs will be trained in deep underground physics and related disciplines, such as low-background techniques, detector technology, nuclear physics and neutrino physics. An education and outreach program with the Morehead Planetarium on the campus of University of North Carolina will bring this science to the public."
0.523199,"Nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics stand at the intersection point of two of the most exciting recent developments in science: (1) the experimentally-driven revolution in neutrino physics; and (2) the startling recent advances in the capabilities of observational astronomy, especially in cosmology.

For example, one key objective of the proposed work is to calculate how neutrinos change from one kind to another in the dense environment of a supernova and in the very early universe, and what this process might mean for the synthesis of the elements. Another objective is to use what we know about how the light nuclei are formed in the first seconds of the universe, together with results of observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, to probe unmeasured neutrino properties, e.g., the neutrino rest mass. <br/><br/>That this work will have the potential to fuel developments in two seemingly disjoint fields, with nuclear physics as the essential fulcrum, is one obvious broader impact. Another is that this project should serve as an excellent training ground for graduate students.

0.425997,"Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS 1510216, Principal Investigator: Kefeng Liu<br/><br/>Deformation theory, moduli spaces and modular forms are fundamental to many subjects of mathematics and physics from geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, number theory to theoretical physics like string theory and cosmology. Many deep results in mathematics and string theory crucially rely on moduli spaces, which describe large families of geometric structures within a related geometric space, which is sometimes larger and less directly defined than the original geometry. A simple example is the collection of isometry classes of metric structures on a circle - these are determined by the circumference of the circle and so correspond to the open line of all positive real numbers; in this example a deformation would be an expansion or contraction of one circle to another of larger or smaller circumference. Understanding of deformations and moduli spaces of projective manifolds from global geometric point of view will reveal deep connections among geometry, algebra and physics, will have fundamental impacts in many research fields in mathematics and physics.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study the geometric and topological structures of the deformation theory, Teichmuller and moduli spaces of projective manifolds, and the modularity of certain generating series of the dimension of the tautological rings on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. More precisely, the PI will study the following three important problems: (1) using the new formulas and iteration method discovered by the PI and collaborators to systemically study global deformation theory and prove deformation invariance of the dimension of pluricanonical sections of Kahler manifolds as conjectured by Siu by explicit geometric constructions; (2) proving a conjecture of Griffiths, which asserts the existence of simultaneous uniformization of all the periods for a family of projective manifolds; (3) exploring a striking relation discovered by the PI and Hao Xu between the Ramanujan mock theta-function and the dimensions of the tautological ring of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces.

0.402512,"The study of binary stellar systems has attracted renewed attention in the past decade as they are shown to play a critical role in a wide range of astronomy areas: X-ray and pulsar binaries, gamma-ray bursts, extrasolar planets, gravitational-wave sources, supernova (SN) progenitors, cosmology, and especially transient astronomy. Observational advances have transformed the landscape and have highlighted the limitations of current modeling attempts. At the same time binary evolution modeling has not advanced significantly in the past decade; in turn, this has limited our ability to understand and interpret a number of current observational results related to binary populations. Building on their past experience, the investigators in this project will advance the physical sophistication of binary modeling and compact object formation and evolution. They will develop the next-generation binary-populations simulation tool (PSyDLib) with major, key advantages for self-consistent, physical modeling. The team will take advantage of the continued increase in computational power and the public availability of MESA, a versatile, robust stellar structure and evolution code. All the simulation codes will be made publicly available for other research projects.<br/><br/>This project will take advantage of the PI's established connections with local schools (urban and suburban in the Chicago area), prior/current work with high-school teachers, and astronomy's appeal to children to address a critical need in elementary- and middle-school level STEM education.

However, in this area most school teachers do not have expertise and voice their need for professional development and appropriate curriculum materials. In collaboration with small teams of experienced teachers, the PI will develop computational astronomy curriculum materials. The PI will also capitalize on past work on astronomy visualizations and develop new ones for mass transfer in binaries and X-ray binary formation. The PI will use them extensively at public outreach presentations at Chicago's Adler Planetarium and the Evanston High School new planetarium. The PI will also involve two female graduate students who will be trained in advanced computation, hence contributing to a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>More technically, the team will develop new modules and an innovative hybrid software structure to incorporate (i) realistic mass-transfer sequences and physical assessment of stability, (ii) advanced treatment of common-envelope evolution eliminating the need for ad-hoc parameterization, and (iii) self-consistent orbital evolution for the general case of eccentric, asynchronous binaries due to tides and mass transfer. The project's science goals focus on studies of (i) core-collapse supernovae in terms of the physical properties of both their progenitors and their binary companions and compare to observational results from supernova surveys and (ii) high-mass X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, which provide a plethora of observed systems with very different properties than originally expected. Given the more substantial XRB samples, the investigators will actually use the comparisons in (ii) to calibrate their models and assess the reliability of predictions for (i). The anticipated results will not only help to explain current observations but will also provide motivation and predictions for future multi-wavelength observations."

0.21,"FRG<br/><br/>Geometric Function Theory is a broad area of mathematics that has its roots in the classical theory of analytic functions of one complex variable. From the very beginning this field has had connections to potential theory, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, and geometric topology. The second half of the twentieth century brought about new areas like quasiconformal and quasiregular mappings, with links to nonlinear PDEs and harmonic analysis. The research group is planning to tackle some of the most important open problems in this broadly construed field by using our diverse strengths. Examples of the problems include understanding the integrability properties of derivatives of conformal mappings, finding criteria for recognizing metric spaces up to bi-Lipschitz or quasiconformal equivalence, further developing the theory of holomorphic curves and its quasiregular generalizations, and investigating algebraic conditions related to quasiconvexity of energy functionals. The intellectual merit of our activity will be found in a deepened understanding of fundamental questions in Geometric Function Theory, in an increase of the links to other fields of mathematics, and in a broader scope of possible applications.<br/><br/>Core mathematics keeps reappearing outside its own realm with dramatic success and consequences. Recent examples range from cosmology (where deep topological issues arise regarding the proposed new dimensions for the universe) to material science (where deformation of elastic bodies are studied by methods of the Calculus of Variations) to engineering (where function theoretic methods have led to advances in control theory). The latter two examples are directly connected with the work of our research group, as are topological issues pertaining to the geometry of three dimensional spaces. Another new feature with possible far reaching reverberations is to use function theoretic methods in studying spaces that are not smooth in the classical sense; such spaces naturally occur when Riemannian structures degenerate and form singularities. The main strength of our group is that its members have common roots, but multifarious interests, so as to make advancement in and connections between separate fields. The broader impact of our activity will be the education of new scholars who understand the methods and techniques in the field, and who know how to find applications of their knowledge to other parts of mathematics and sciences. We will put great weight on passing on the important questions to the younger generation and on enabling them to perform independent research."
0.2,"Gravitational physics is on the edge of a discovery that will shake its foundation: the direct detection of gravitational waves, tiny oscillations of the curvature of space-time that were predicted 100 years ago by Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Gravitational waves are produced by changes in the gravitational field of accelerating masses, and their detection will reveal information from the most cataclysmic and mysterious events in the Universe: the death of a star, the collision of black holes, and the Big Bang. This new era of gravitational physics is being ushered in by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and its sister project Virgo. This year marks the completion of hardware upgrades that form Advanced LIGO, a quantum-noise-limited laser interferometer which will probe about 1000 times more galaxies than initial LIGO. Source population studies suggest it will routinely detect gravitational waves from the collision of neutron stars and black holes. This award supports mission critical research for the detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO at the Georgia Institute of Technology, for the detection, characterization and astrophysical interpretation of gravitational wave transient signals in data from the first Advanced LIGO science runs.<br/><br/><br/>This project has three components: (1) participation in the LIGO-Virgo all-sky search for generic gravitational wave transients, sensitive to a wide range of compact object signatures, including core-collapse supernovae, coalescence of neutron star and/or black hole binary systems and neutron star oscillations, (2) development of innovative approaches to blending data analysis and numerical relativity, with contribution to targeted searches for binary black hole coalescences, and (3) characterization of Advanced LIGO data to enable scientific discovery, to deliver the data quality information necessary to clean the data sets and veto false positives, and to identify data quality issues early enough that they can be mitigated in the instruments, within the LIGO Detector Characterization team. The award will benefit from the long term collaboration of the PI and co-PI and a synergistic team at the GeorgiaTech Center for Relativistic Astrophysics, with experts in computational astrophysics, cosmology, particle astrophysics, astronomy, the college of computing and a strong outreach program in Atlanta, enhanced by the new ties to the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and a firm commitment to diversity and the role of women in STEM."
0.17,"Understanding the origin of the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe is one of the primary goals of physics and cosmology. One potential explanation for the asymmetry requires the neutrino be its own antiparticle, meaning that the neutrino and antineutrino are the same particle. If the neutrino has this property it would show that the neutrino gets its mass in a fundamentally different way than all other particles, and help explain the absence of antimatter in the universe. Neutrinoless double beta decay is the only practical way to establish if the neutrino is its own antiparticle. This award will support the PI and his group in a search for neutrinoless double beta decay using the SNO+ detector in an operating mine in Sudbury Ontario. <br/><br/><br/>SNO+ is a multipurpose neutrino experiment whose primary goal is a search for neutrinoless double beta decay using tellurium (Te) dissolved in the liquid scintillator. SNO+ will also a have broad program of neutrino physics including measurements of solar neutrinos, nucleon decay, reactor neutrinos, geo-neutrinos, and detection of neutrinos from a supernova should one occur. The SNO+ benefits from a high mass of isotope and several other advantages. If the background levels are as anticipated, the SNO+ technique (i.e., using a large liquid scintillator detector) could provide an extremely cost-effective way to cover a wide range of effective Majorana masses."

0.159555,"AST-0070809<br/>Kandrup, Henry E.<br/>Structure and Stability of Cuspy Triaxial Galaxies<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to construct triaxial distribution functions (DFs) for cuspy elliptical galaxies and early-type bulges. This will involve the integration of techniques from classical celestial mechanics, modern nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics, as well as numerical algorithms, such as modifications to Schwartzschild's technique for DF construction. It aims to answer the question: What is the connection between the DF and the surface density profiles in triaxial galaxies, and what is the influence of chaos in this connection or are the surface density profiles relics of initial conditions?<br/><br/>Recent high resolution observations indicate that many (perhaps most) elliptical galaxies have a pronounced density cusp, possibly associated with the presence of a supermassive black hole; in addition, for galaxies where the cusp is not too steep, there is often evidence for moderate deviations from axisymmetry. However, theoretical arguments, corroborated by numerical investigations, suggest strongly that many of the stars in a cuspy, nonaxisymetric galaxy will<br/>exhibit chaotic motions. Until very recently, almost all work in this area has completely ignored the possible effects of this chaos. This project will explore the physical implications of this chaos on the structure and evolution of galaxies, with particular focus on determining potentially observable signatures. Questions to be addressed include the following: 1. Is it reasonable to model such galaxies as being in a time-independent statistical equilibrium, or would one anticipate that cuspy nonaxisymmetric galaxies should exhibit systematic evolutionary effects over astronomically interesting time scales? 2. How susceptible are such galaxies towards low amplitude gravitational irregularities associated with the presence of other comparatively nearby galaxies? 3. How will such a galaxy respond to a collision or close encounter with a very nearby galaxy? Much of this work involves applications of ideas which have been developed by physicists and applied mathematicians over the past thirty years and which have been confirmed repeatedly in the laboratory. However, an important new feature arising in the context of galaxies is that the chaos is generated self-consistently: In most laboratory experiments, chaos is triggered by some external stimulus acting on the system being probed. When considering a galaxy one is confronted with a situation where the chaos is induced by the gravity associated with the matter in the galaxy itself. <br/>Funding for this project is provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/><br/>***"
0.472,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>The nature of dark matter is one of the most important research topics in physics today. It pertains to fundamental unanswered questions in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. A possible candidate for dark matter is a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). The goal of the Cryogenic Dark matter Search (CDMS) experiment is to develop a detector that has the sensitivity to observe such WIMPs if they exist. The research objective of this project is to improve the background rejection of current and future SuperCDMS detectors by means of significantly improved energy, position, and timing determination. This work will make important contributions to both the current SuperCDMS experiment at Soudan and the design and successful operation of the collaboration's next-generation, 5 kg detectors for a future 100 kg experiment and beyond through the following tasks: i) Development of SuperCDMS detector models from first principles. The PI will model the time structure of the phonon pulses as a function of position, energy, and recoil type to understand the source of discrepancies between their current models and data; and ii) Development of a novel detector characterization and calibration facility to measure phonon pulse shapes and ionization response as a function of event energy, position, and recoil type. This unique mapping of detector response will be used to refine the detector simulation described above as well as provide an exhaustive, empirical data set for defining the background rejection analyses. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the program includes training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in experimental physics. The technology and methods developed have direct applications in neutrino and X-ray astrophysics as well as broader applications in superconducting detectors with uses in material science and nuclear isotope identification."

0.007997,"A great deal has been written about the achievements, influence, and power of the American community of theoretical physics in the twentieth century. Among the towering figures of this community has been John Archibald Wheeler (1911-) whose life and career spanned the entire century. Wheeler is popularly known for his coining of the term ""black hole"" and for his collaboration with Niels Bohr in explicating the theoretical basis for the general mechanism of nuclear fission in 1939. He also made significant contributions to the areas of nuclear and particle physics, general relativity and cosmology, and information theory and quantum mechanics. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of John Wheeler lies in his work as a mentor. <br/><br/>On average, an academic physicist will supervise fifteen Ph.D. students over the course of a career. Wheeler supervised more than three times that number. Nor were Wheeler's students average. Harriet Zuckerman has observed that the most promising students and the most successful mentors tend to seek out each other. The list of former Wheeler students contains some of the most highly regarded physicists of the twentieth century, including Richard Feynman, Charles Misner, David Hill, Kip Thorne and Jacob Bekenstein. No less than five Festschrifts for John Wheeler have been organized by his students and colleagues.<br/><br/>Wheeler's role in physics extended well outside the academic community. A key player in the Manhattan Project, working mainly at Hanford, Wheeler remained active in defense related research or consultation throughout his career, including development of the hydrogen bomb and the instigation of Project Matterhorn and Project Jason, which enabled physicists to do defense research on their own campus. He served on the Boards of Battelle International and Southwest Research which administered and carried out scores of research projects for government agencies, particularly the Department of Defense, and some of his students became involved in this research.<br/><br/>The scope of Wheeler's oeuvre, the number and accomplishments of his students, and his political (as well as philosophical) influence on theoretical physics in the United States make him a pivotal figure in understanding the achievements, influence, and power of this community. The study of scientific pedagogy has been a focus of significant recent scholarship, as has been the analysis of research groups and research schools. The practical exercise of mentorship and leadership through the processes of apprenticeship, collaboration, and what may be called ""chains of wisdom"" is the focus of this research project, with John Archibald Wheeler's career and influence in the construction of twentieth-century American theoretical physics at the project's center. <br/><br/>The merit of the present project lies in its original analysis of John Wheeler's practice of pedagogy, mentorship, and leadership in twentieth-century American theoretical physics within the context of a large body of current literature in science studies and the history of physics. The project's new data and perspectives will be useful to scientists, as well as historians and sociologists. A compelling merit of this project is its integration of analysis of developments in scientific research with processes in scientific education at the university and post-graduate levels.<br/><br/>The impact of the project is broad and significant. First of all, this project will offer insights into the teaching and training of scientists and illuminate how they learn to become productive achievers. These results will be useful to science educators and to makers of science policy. Secondly, this project will have a positive impact on visually impaired scholars in developing and using research methods that capitalize on recent technical innovations in adaptive hardware and software. Finally, this project demonstrates that visually impaired scholars can make meaningful contributions to the study of science and society."
0.203988,"ABSTRACT Partridge The galaxies and clusters now visible in the Universe grew from small perturbations in density present at very early times, corresponding to redshifts >1000. Many details of this evolutionary process are poorly understood. In particular, we have only rudimentary (but rapidly improving) understanding of the formation of cosmic structure in the first 5 billion years after the recombination of the primeval plasma, that is in the large range of redshifts 1-1000. Refined radio-wavelength searches for various classes of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) will tell us more about the early phases of structure formation, at the high end of this crucial redshift interval. Optical, IR and radio observations of galaxies or galaxy fragments at z = 1-3 are already providing important clues to the final stages of galaxy formation (e.g., the onset of star formation). Searches for CBR fluctuations and radio wavelength observations of high redshift galaxies will be carried out. The goal of the research is to help bridge the gap in our understanding of cosmic evolution during the epoch corresponding to redshifts (z) = 1-1000. A study of the Hubble Deep Field at radio wavelengths will be carried out. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is a small but typical region of the sky selected by astronomers for intensive study at all wavelengths, beginning with a very deep Space Telescope exposure late last year. The aim is to use observations across the electromagnetic spectrum to move our understanding of galaxy evolution forward. Our radio observations will be carried out at the Very Large Array at 8.4 and 1.4 GHz and with angular resolution from 10"" down to 0.4"" (close to the Space Telescope resolution). Among the scientific goals of our observations are: --measuring radio spectra and morphologies to determine the nature of the radio emission (synchrotron from supernova activity? active galactic nuclei?) --refining counts of radio source s at low flux densities --examining the correlation of radio and optical luminosities --improving limits on fluctuations in the CBR on angular scales 6""-80"" --searching for the microwave signals produced by clusters or protoclusters of galaxies at z > 1. Several related projects will parallel these efforts, including further work on foreground sources of noise which interfere with searches for CBR fluctuations, planning for a European space mission to map the CBR, and near infrared observations of both high redshift galaxies already observed at the VLA and of the 2-4 micron cosmic microwave background. A postdoctoral associate will assist in some or all of these projects. The position is intended, however, to provide the postdoc with further experience and training in both teaching and research. In addition to his or her research involvement, the postdoc would design and teach one course per year at Haverford, under the close supervision and mentoring of members of our department. Undergraduate students will be involved in various aspects of the research."

A<br/>basic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them<br/>into families with common properties and understood<br/>limits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that<br/>combine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of<br/>geometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,<br/>notably Teichmuller theory.

At the same<br/>time, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal<br/>surfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass<br/>representations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully<br/>documented, and useful as a research tool.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to<br/>biochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;<br/>indeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their<br/>foundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some<br/>or several of its features in the expression we witness.

In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in<br/>physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,<br/>the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating<br/>droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications<br/>range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of<br/>stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many<br/>other optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we<br/>do not have much general information about solutions to the<br/>equation expressing extremality.

0.11,"Almost every geophysical process leaves it signature in the terrestrial gravity field or its changes. If the process is ""big'' enough, it can be measured by GRACE, a twin satellite mission that is sensitive to the Earth's time-variable gravity field, which has been yielding data for about seven years now. Among its many other accomplishments, models based on GRACE have provided evidence that the Earth's polar regions are losing mass due to progressive melting of their ice cover, and GRACE modeling has also helped constrain crustal deformation resulting from large earthquakes, thereby inaugurating an era of a new class of earthquake observations. The GRACE data are noisy and require extensive processing, filtering, and statistical analysis to yield signals of this kind, which are buried deeply beneath the noise and contaminated by the geophysical signatures of ocean currents, the hydrological cycle, or post-glacial rebound. <br/><br/>Our methods development will enable us, and the scientific community, to make the most of today's available GRACE data. Well-constrained mass flux rates from Earth's polar regions, and their errors, and the robust detection, analysis and modeling of the coseismic deformation from large earthquakes will stand alone as scientific results, but they will also feed back into climate research, glaciology, seismology, and geodesy. Even more broadly than that, the problems we solve are relevant in providing new estimation methods for noisy and incomplete data distributed on a sphere, in the most general sense, e.g. as used in biomedical and statistical research, in physics, cosmology and computer science.<br/><br/>We develop a new mathematical technique for the inversion of GRACE data, which are noisy and incomplete. Central to this effort is the development of ""noise-cognizant Slepian functions'', a function basis, alternative to spherical harmonics, that is eminently suited to represent and analyze geographically localized, bandlimited, signals on the sphere. No longer producing only spatial averages of the signal, nor reprocessing global models based on spherical harmonics, we perform inversions on time series of the inter-satellite potential difference derived from GRACE, directly in this basis. From this we recover estimates of the entire spatial dependence of the mass gain/loss in ice-covered regions and hydrological basins, as well as estimates of the gravity perturbations accompanying large earthquakes. The former are important to science and society per se, the latter add information on a different temporal and spatial scale to that which can be had from GPS measurements or seismological data.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Geophysics, Arctic Natural Sciences, and Antarctic Earth Sciences Programs."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This program, working with techniques on the leading edge of measurement technology, supports education and training of physics and electrical engineering undergraduate students in the PI's group, a diverse body including non-traditional and first-generation college students, as well as students from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The PI participates in the CU Denver's Mini-STEM school, the local Caf´e Scientifique, and a field trip program at a local K-8 magnet school.<br/><br/>This award will enable the PI and his students to fulfill specific responsibilities for both SuperCDMS Soudan and SuperCDMS SNOLAB projects, including operations support for SuperCDMS Soudan, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) characterization and testing for SNOLAB, and support during construction and initial commissioning. Planned activities also include a modest R&D effort toward multiplexed SQUID readout, required for the next-generation dark matter direct detection efforts."

The Ku-band Polarization Identifier (KUPID) will integrate a very low noise, correlation polarimeter onto the Crawford Hill seven meter, millimeter-wave antenna. The primary components of the polarimeter will be built at the University of Miami and other key components, including the microwave horn and data acquisition system will be built at the University of Chicago and Princeton University. This project will measure the Q and U Stokes parameters in regions near the north celestial pole, in regions of low galactic contamination, and in regions near the galactic plane. The goals of this survey are multifold and span the studies of the interstellar medium to cosmology. The primary goals are to: (1) Measure the structure of both high and low galactic latitude synchrotron radiation; (2) Identify the source of the ""anomalous emission"" that is predicted to peak near a wavelength of two centimeters; (3) Measure cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization in the event that the galactic foregrounds are subdominant; (4) Perform complementary, follow-up surveys of interesting regions identified by the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) and other Cosmic Microwave Background polarization surveys.<br/>***"
0.393011,"The Microcalorimeter Array for a Rhenium Experiment (MARE) is an experiment for the direct detection of the neutrino mass by studying the beta decay of 187-Re with cryogenic microcalorimeters. The experiment is divided in two steps, MARE I, the heir of the MANU and MIBETA experiments with a sensitivity of ~2 eV and MARE II with a sensitivity of 0.1-0.2 eV. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding to continue these scientists' current effort with the MARE I investigation and to help build a prototype detector for the full MARE II. The MARE I effort involves the Universities of Miami and Florida in collaboration with the University of Genoa, Italy. It will ultimately consist of tens of iridium transition edge sensors (TES) microcalorimeters coupled to rhenium crystal absorbers. The first detectors are being assembled at this time and data acquisition was expected to start by the end of 2009. They have been supporting the development and fabrication of prototype detectors and have started building an infrastructure for the handling and analysis of the data, including a full scale experimental simulation. During the proposed investigation, they will support the acquisition and analysis of the data. The data acquisition is expected to extend though the second year of this investigation, while the third year will be dedicated to the data analysis. In parallel to continuing their support of the MARE I investigation, they plan to work toward the full MARE II investigation. This is a much larger scale investigation that will ultimately involve several groups in the US and Europe. The investigation will be carried out in close collaboration with other members of the collaboration. <br/><br/>Determining the value of the electron neutrino mass has a broad impact on various fields of physics, from particle and nuclear physics and cosmology. The microcalorimeter technology being developed has direct applications in dark matter searches, detectors for non-proliferation investigations, astrophysics and nuclear physics. The investigation will be carried out with the active support of graduate and undergraduate students that will be fully involved in all aspects of the investigation. In addition to the intrinsic scientific merits and broader impact, the investigation is an ideal tool for the training of the next generation scientists."
0.179856,"The principal investigator proposes to study a number of current problems in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry that have a strong connection with fully nonlinear elliptic equations such as Monge-Ampere equations or mean curvature equations. In particular the PI will attempt to extend his study of complete hypersurfaces of constant curvature in hyperbolic space, especially in the convex case, to the constant curvature simply connected Lorentz space forms, namely Minkowski space, de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space. The PI will also study boundedness and monotonicity properties of positive solutions of semilinear elliptic pde's, especially in the so-called supercritical case. Global boundedness fails in general but the PI will attempt to show monotonicity of solutions in a uniform neighborhood of the boundary. He will also explore the closely related problem of uniform boundedness of semi-stable solutions. There is a close connection of this problem with the open Bernstein problem for stable minimal hypersurfaces. Finally the PI is interested in the totally degenerate complex Monge-Ampere equation described by Mabuchi, Semmes and Donaldson, which arises in the study of geodesics in the space of Kahler potentials in a fixed Kahler class.<br/><br/><br/>This project is aimed at developing new analytic techniques to solve problems in geometry, physics, biology and astronomy where the underlying physical and geometrical equations can be described by elliptic partial differential equations. Such techniques have been extremely successful in problems which model curvature phenomena or use curvature flows as an analytic tool. These methods have broad applications in pure and applied mathematics, especially quantum physics and cosmology, image processing, optimal design and computational biology."

Robinson of the University of California Lick Observatory in a research collaboration with Dr. Gustavo Bruzual of the Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia (CIDA) in Merida, Venezuela. The purpose of the collaboration is to establish a long-term joint program involving two parts: the first involves travel and data-transfer support for a pilot instrumentation project to develop a large-format electronic (CCD) camera for use on the new CIDA 1-meter Schmidt telescope. Lick and CIDA astronomers will then use this powerful combination to undertake various extensive new photometric and synoptic surveys of joint scientific interest. One of these will be a major new long-term observational survey of 20 areas in the sky. Among many potential programs using these data will be a multicolor photometric survey to study the luminosity function of galaxies and a synoptic program to search for very distant supernovae. The second part of the collaboration will attempt to develop new quantitative methods of analyzing extensive multidimensional data, aimed mainly at exploring the evolution of galaxies and cosmology. Major observational surveys are some of the most productive astronomical tools to understand the universe. Such surveys allow astronomers to measure distributions of properties of known objects and also to discover new, rare, or unusual classes of objects. Despite their importance, photometric surveys that cover large areas, synoptic programs, or any long-term projects are all particularly difficult to undertake in today's climate of scarce telescope time. The CIDA observatory in Venezuela has recently finished the construction of a 1-meter Schmidt telescope that has overall optical properties similar to the one at Palomar and is the among the three largest in the northern hemisphere. The collaborators' plan to develop imaging cameras for the telescope at CIDA using charge coupled detectors (CCDs) of very large format developed at the Detector Laboratory at Lick, plus the ability of CIDA to provide dedicated observers time for long-term surveys should allow astronomers to undertake a variety of new surveys of unprecedented depth, time and areal coverage."

That school has been held annually since 1976. NSF has supported U.S. participation in four of these years. The school has some impressive features: the continuity of plans and programs, the continuous support of European scientific organization including the Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, the high caliber of lectures from the U.S. and other countries and the broad scope of students and faculty members from South Asian countries who attend. The meetings are evolving into one of Pakistans, and South Asias, main scientific events every year. Topics typically provide overview of recent developments in various branches of physics and related fields (materials, biophysics) and the implications for the society. Lectures, seminars, and workshops and discussions cover subjects such as energy, condensed matter physics, lasers, computational physics, nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology and biophysics. The topics to be covered at 1990 meeting include development of advanced materials, accelerator physics, recent trends in solar energy and other alternate energy sources, and atmospheric and oceanic research. The meetings lead to solid interaction between scientists from the LDC's of South Asia and those from the Western countries with potential for futher collaboration. Proceedings of these meetings are usually published and widely disseminated.

Yet despite major improvements in wide area and campus networks, data movement remains often frustratingly difficult and slow, due to obstacles such as firewalls and inadequate tools.<br/><br/>To overcome this problem, this project develops an easy-to-use, high-performance data transfer and synchronization solution that can operate everywhere researchers need their data to be: desktops and research labs, campus servers and HPC facilities, supercomputing centers, scientific instruments, and public and private cloud providers. This new data movement solution builds on the widely used Globus implementation of the GridFTP protocol and the newer Globus Transfer hosted data movement service, plus the Indiana University implementation of the eXtensible Session Protocol (XSP), which provides for negotiation of end-to-end circuits via protocols such as OpenFlow. It incorporates numerous new capabilities, including negotiation of end-to-end circuits; communication between pairs of nodes that are both behind network address translation (NAT) devices or firewalls; new data movement capabilities such as efficient verification of transfers; and HTTP for communication with object stores.<br/><br/>Resulting software solutions are delivered to the NSF community via a combination of Globus Transfer and the GridFTP and XSP open source software distributions.

0.069069,"Proponents of the fine-tuning argument believe that facts from physics about the nature of the universe can give insight into traditional philosophical issues such as whether God exists and whether other worlds exist. Specifically, they maintain that at least some of the fundamental constants (such as the masses of the fundamental particles and the strength ratios between the fundamental forces) are finely tuned for life, in that if the constants had slightly different values life could not exist. Proponents of the theistic fine-tuning argument conclude from this that an intelligent designer such as God exists, and this designer designed the universe so as to be life- permitting. Proponents of the many-worlds fine-tuning argument, on the other hand, conclude from this that our universe is one of many existing universes, with different sets of fundamental constants (and perhaps laws) obtaining in the different universes.<br/>The PI plans to examine the fine-tuning argument critically, paying careful attention to the various philosophy of science issues that are raised in discussions of this argument. The product will include a book arguing that (with some qualifications) no version of the fine-tuning argument is successful. A goal of the research is to gain insight into various issues in philosophy of science that surround the fine-tuning argument. These include issues in probability theory, such as the problem of old evidence, Bayesian versus non-Bayesian versions of inference, and probability theory as it relates to self-locating beliefs (as in for example the Doomsday argument). Non-probabilistic issues include possible-worlds representations of modality, and various controversies involving explanation, including the viability of inference to the best explanation. <br/>The PI will ensure that the research has an impact beyond the community of academic philosophers. The book will be written in such a way that it is accessible to someone without training in philosophy (though it will be more advanced than, say, a popular science book). Underrepresented minority undergraduates from University of Kentucky and undergraduates from area non-Ph.D. granting institutions will be recruited to work on the research. In conjunction with the UK physics department and the Gaines Center for the Humanities, there will be a conference on philosophy and cosmology, which will be accessible to students and non-academics. Additionally, a debate will be organized by UK's Veritas Forum, an annual student-run Christian speaker series. Finally, there will be lectures presented at various places, such as Asbury College and the historically black Kentucky State University."
0.079429,"In the Carolingian Renaissance of the ninth century, what brought the science of astronomy to maturity sufficient to provide conceptual foundations that lasted for the next 350 years? Why was the Astronomia of Martianus Capella chosen as the textbook for elaboration in pursuit of the conceptual inquiries and clarifications, both verbal and -diagrammatic, that appeared? What needs did ninth-century scholars identify for the developing study of astronomy in commentaries on this text? In answering these questions, the project will locate the study of Capella's astronomy in the context of the Carolingian revival of ancient Roman texts for studying the liberal art of astronomy. The project will then set forth the manuscript evidence for conversations among the scholars who produced a remarkable body of graphic and verbal discussion of so many points in the text of the Astronomia. The revival of texts on astronomy and cosmology from the Roman Empire by Carolingian scholars initiated a new stage in scientific awareness, advancing well beyond the focus of the previous three centuries upon time-keeping and the construction of calendars. For the study of astronomy, only the work of Martianus Capella received extensive glossing and comments during the ninth century, though other ancient texts offered relevant material. The commentaries appear in a set of manuscripts stretching from the 830s to the end of the century. Identifying and editing the most important of these commentaries, the ""Anonymous,"" then studying the interactions among many commentaries, will show how Carolingians conceived of astronomy. The Carolingian achievement laid the foundation for teaching astronomy for another three hundred years. <br/> This project will produce an edition of the ""Anonymous"" commentary (with diagrams) made before 850 and will examine differences among the variants and other commentaries as well as with the published commentaries of John Scot Eriugena (ca. 850) and Remigius of Auxerre (ca. 900). This wealth of commentary material permits the search for and discovery of interactions among the commentaries. These interactions, or conversations, uncover the variety and developing concerns among ninth-century scholars of astronomy and their subsequent impacts. <br/> To advance scientific understanding the project will: (a) establish precisely and fully the primary evidence for ninth-century knowledge and views of Capella's astronomical textbook, (b) identify and edit the ""Anonymous"" commentary, (c) distinguish different viewpoints among the commentaries, (d) explain the conversations that produced the apparent interactions, and (e) show the significance of diagrams in each of these points. The project will contribute to the following research: (a) a study of the motives for scientific studies in the Carolingian Renaissance, (b) the importance of diagrams in early scientific development, and (c) the significance of Carolingian astronomy for the later reception of Greco-Arabic science. <br/> The project will produce an electronic edition of the ""Anonymous"" commentary as part of a larger project on Martianus Capella at the Constantijn Huygens Institute in The Hague. A separate study of this commentary and others of the ninth century will be published. For teachers the astronomical diagrams will provide actual historical examples of graphic models of problem-statement and problem-solving that students can analyze."
0.156808,"The mathematics in this proposal lies at the intersection of geometric analysis, geometry, and low-dimensional topology. In particular, the researchers use geometric function theory in the form of the theory of quasiconformal mappings to probe analytic symmetries of hyperbolizable surfaces and $n$-manifolds. With equal emphasis, this proposal also details analytic questions in the theory of quasiconformal mappings. In particular the researchers tie together certain geometric invariants to the conjectured solution in dimensions three and above of the Teichmuller extremal problem. Another major theme in their work involves the interaction between dynamics and geometry as illuminated by Patterson-Sullivan theory. The researchers describe projects that study the generalization of the Patterson-Sullivan theory of Kleinian groups to both the setting of convex co-compact subgroups of the modular group, and to the purely analytic setting of discrete quasiconformal groups.<br/><br/>The nexus of hyperbolic geometry, conformal analysis, and low-dimensional topology is a vast and fundamental area of study in mathematics. It dates back to the 19th century, when it was developed by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein, and Poincare. These fields remain vital, as attested by the recent epochal results of G. Perelman on the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures. As mathematics is inherently interconnected, surprising and beautiful applications are often found at the interfaces of mathematical fields. Recently, hyperbolic geometry has found<br/>application in the study of discrete geometry and machine vision. Further, in physics both hyperbolic geometry and conformal analysis (especially in the guise of Teichmuller theory) have become a standard tool in the exploration of theoretical physics and cosmology. Wesleyan University has a strong dual identity as a research and teaching institution, and the proposers are strongly dedicated to innovation in both research and education. A core objective of the researchers is to use the broad and integrative relationship between hyperbolic geometry and geometric analysis to increase both the interest and strength of those advanced undergraduate <br/>and beginning graduate students enrolled in graduate analysis and geometry courses at Wesleyan University."

0.0504,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>Generalized geometries form a class of almost complex manifolds with reduced structure groups, which have become of central importance to the study of realistic string theory models. These are natural generalizations of Calabi-Yau manifolds and are of mathematical interest in their own right. In one class important for string theory, the canonical structure one seeks on a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold is governed by a ``warp factor equation'' that couples a balanced Hermitian metric to an anti self-dual connection of a vector bundle. When the manifold is Kahler Calabi-Yau and the vector bundle is the tangent bundle, this system reduces to the Calabi conjecture for Ricci-flat metrics. The mathematical understanding of generalized geometries is still in its nascent stage. The purpose of this proposal is to develop this field further, into a full-fledged extension of Kahler Calabi-Yau geometries. We will focus on the following tightly interconnected problems: constructing new solutions to string theory in this class; characterizing the deformations and specifically the moduli of these spaces; understanding ""worldsheet instantons"" and their enumerative geometry in these manifolds; and an understanding of ""generalized calibrations,"" the analog of calibrated submanifolds of special holonomy manifolds.<br/><br/>The proposed project is to study the mathematics of a new class of geometric objects called ""generalized geometries"", and the appearance of this class in string theory. Mathematically, these structures provide interesting and natural extensions of a well-known class of geometric constructions in Calabi-Yau geometry. Physically, these extensions are known to be required to capture essential features of particle physics and cosmology, and will push string theorists closer to the goal of making contact with observations. The project is a multi-institutional and interdisciplinary effort, involving mathematicians and physicists at Brandeis, Harvard, and Texas A&M."

For a number of years now, theorists have been deeply interested in the role that gravity plays in the interaction of the many microscopic particles of high energy physics and how one may unify all the forces of nature with gravity. A leading theory to understand this is string theory. Strings are extended objects whose different oscillations describe the different particles. Strings are one dimensional objects, and two dimensional objects such as membranes and even higher dimensional objects called ""branes"" can exist and are believed to play a fundamental role in unifying the forces. This framework for describing the forces of nature will be developed further and the important issue of seeing how Einstein's theory of general relativity emerges from the general unification will be investigated.<br/><br/>It is generally believed that the laws of physics will be modified at higher energies from the currently known laws that hold at low energies. Over the next five years, high energy accelerators, experiments to detect the dark matter in the universe, and satellite experiments on cosmology will be able to test this. There are now several leading proposals as to what the nature of these new laws might be, and research will be carried out to determine the signals that might show up at these experiments that will allow us to infer from the experiments the new fundamental laws of nature."

One project is to study the solutions of the full nonlinear system of Einstein equations in a weak gravitational wave regime. We will continue our work on the L2 curvature conjecture, asserting that a solution, metric g, of the Einstein vacuum equations Ric(g) = 0 can be locally extended whenever its curvature tensor is bounded in L2 . We will also study problem of stability of Minkowski space for models where gravity is coupled to matter fields. Another direction of investigation is to continue rigorous mathematical study of linear and nonlinear waves in the regime of strong gravitational fields. The project will also investigate problems of stability of topological solitons in classical field theories connected with models of Quantum Field Theory and Gauge Theory. We will concentrate on development of robust analysis methods for these models without requiring any complete integrability assumptions. We will investigate connections between infinite dimensional dynamics, generated by the above models, and geodesic motion induced on finite dimensional moduli spaces of static solutions associated with these equations. <br/><br/>The Einstein equations of General Relativity provide the main classical description of evolution of the physical space-time continuum. The study of mathematical and physical phenomena arising in General Relativity is of fundamental importance for cosmology. While the physical understanding of the subject has made rapid advancement and generated a number of outstanding conjectures; so far there have been relatively few rigorous mathematical results. To a large extent, this is due to the highly nonlinear nature of the Einstein equations and a lack of mathematical tools for analyzing them. This project will pursue the development of such mathematical tools and results and involves many mathematical issues at the interface of Analysis, Geometry and Partial Differential Equations."
0.333326,"This cosmology project will measure the isotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) that was emitted early in the formation of the universe. The measurements will be made at wavelengths both longer (approximately 3 millimeters) and shorter (less that 1 millimeter) than the peak in the CMBR spectrum. Because these radio waves are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere, especially water vapor, South Pole Station, which is the second driest inhabited place on Earth is the best place to make these measurements (the Soviet Antarctic Station Vostok is slightly colder and drier). In addition, the circumpolar motion of the celestial sky means that any spot in the sky can be watched through a constant thickness of atmosphere for any length of time, which is also a great advantage. To date all measurements of the CMBR have shown the radiation to be isotropic, that is, it comes from all directions with equal intensity. It is clear that this cannot be true at very small variations in intensity nor at all angular scales, any more than the likelihood that the sky would be uniformly bright in visible light. The amount of variation, and angular scale of those variations are sensitive tests of the theories of the creation and early history of the universe. This project is a search for these expected variations."

Using a dedicated 2.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico, it will survey the sky over the next five years, compiling detailed data on 100 million galaxies, stars, and quasars. Early results from the survey have shown its potential on many fronts, including the search for the most distant objects in the universe. Quasars, which appear as unresolved, exceedingly luminous points of light in the sky, are believed to be the result of the radiation given off as material falls into a black hole one billion times more massive than the sun. Their extreme luminosity allow them to be detected at very great distances. The Sloan Survey has allowed us to discover a great number of the most distant quasars yet known. We plan to do a number of investigations of these enigmatic objects over the next few years: a). Compile complete samples of distant quasars, to study their<br/>tendency to cluster together and to understand their evolution with time. b). Study the physical properties of these systems with telescopes sensitive to a large range of wavelengths, to understand the processes by which they formed and how they generate their tremendous luminosities. c). Study the immediate environment of these quasars to learn about their effect on neighboring galaxies, and the diffuse gas which permeates the space between quasars. d). Discover new classes of quasars and other phenomena which our complete survey should bring to light.

0.130395,"AST 0098625<br/>Stone<br/>A wide variety of objects, ranging from new stars in formation (protostars), to objects which are the cinders of burned out stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes), to active galactic nuclei (AGN, such as quasars) are thought to have accretion disks surrounding them. Inflows of gas from these disks onto the central object seem to account for some of the most dramatic components of the Universe. They emit prodigious amounts of power and radiate it over a tremendous swath of the electromagnetic spectrum (from the mid-infrared to hard X-rays and gamma rays). Our theoretical understanding of these accretion flows, however, is still limited by the complexities involved in developing the necessary magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and radiation hydrodynam-ics computer models. Our understanding of the local physics that control such flows has progressed rapidly in the last few years. It is now important to examine how local processes such as the magnetorotational instability (MRI) determine global disk structure and evolution, especially since only global disk models can be directly compared to high spatial-, spectral-, and time-resolution observations of accretion flows around protostars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.<br/>Using computational methods, this project will develop the first time-dependent, three-dimensional MHD models of the interaction of an accretion disk with a magnetized and rotating central star. These calculations will allow quantitative measurement of the mixing rate of the stellar field into the disk, the size of the interaction region, the time-averaged torque exerted on the star, and the geometry and kinematics of any polar cap accretion flows that might form. Such quantities are fundamental to the theory of how magnetized stars interact with accretion disks, yet to date they have yet to be calculated from first principles. Direct comparison of the simulations to a large and varied set of observations will be undertaken, including spectroscopic observations of magnetospheric funnel flows and accretion shocks in T Tauri stars, and the observed distribution of the rotation rates in T Tauri stars. Synthetic spectra of the models will be compared to that observed for accreting black holes at the center of early type galaxies and the galactic center, while fluctuations in the mass accretion rate can be compared to X-ray variabil-ity observed by RXTE in X-ray binaries. These global calculations are the first step towards star-disk interaction models which span many decades in radius.<br/>The calculations will all be performed with a variety of 2D and 3D MHD computer codes, using large allocations of supercomputer time on massively parallel machines at the national supercomputer centers.

0.161071,"The project concerns the study of the local and global behavior of solutions to the Einstein equations of general relativity, a non-linear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations at the intersection of analysis, geometry, theoretical physics, cosmology and astrophysics. An outstanding problem is to establish the non-linear stability of the Kerr family of black hole solutions, and it is precisely here where the project intends to make a contribution. The past ten years have seen tremendous progress in understanding the boundedness and decay properties of (linear and non-linear) wave equations on black hole backgrounds, a problem which is generally thought of as a primer to the full non-linear stability problem, which would take the full tensorial structure and quasi-linearity of the Einstein equations into account. Previous work of the principal investigator has generalized some of these techniques available for the wave equation to the setting of the Bianchi equations establishing in particular a conditional result on the propagation of regularity and decay in the setting of metrics converging to Schwarzschild. Future research is directed towards generalizing the work to the Kerr setting, as well as to isolate and study an appropriate linear problem for gravitational perturbations in this context. This work will be carried out in collaboration with M. Dafermos and I. Rodnianski. A second research direction is to continue the work on stability and instability of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes initiated by the principal investigator and J. Smulevici in 2011. In particular, in collaboration with J. Luk and J. Smulevici, the principal investigator plans to study the conjectured non-linear instability of anti-de Sitter space within the model of the spherically symmetric scalar field.<br/><br/>General relativity is the currently accepted theory of spacetime dynamics. While the field equations were already written down by Einstein in 1915, the full mathematical content of the theory is still far from being understood. One of the most exciting predictions of the theory is the existence of so-called black hole solutions of the field equations. Some of these can be written down explicitly and one two-parameter family of solutions (the Kerr family) in particular is conjectured to play a fundamental role as the final state of any vacuum gravitational collapse. While there is now sufficient astrophysical evidence that black holes indeed exist in the observable universe,the simple mathematical question of stability of these solutions is unknown. The difficulty of this problem roots in the strong non-linearities in the Einstein equations and their tensorial structure. In this way studying the Einstein equations in the context of black hole stability has broader impact for the entire field of non-linear partial differential equations (a mathematical technique to understand non-linearities may generalize to other equations) and geometry, as well as astrophysical observations."

0.299999,"High-energy gamma rays are used to study the most extreme objects in the Universe, such as the black holes at the centers of distant galaxies and gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful explosions since the Big Bang. Cosmic gamma rays can also provide clues to new physical principles beyond the scope of the current understanding of subatomic physics and cosmology. The very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays studied in this research have about 100 million times as much energy as the X-rays used for medical images. None the less, their detection is difficult because they are absorbed by the atmosphere. At the lower energies, the number of gamma rays from astrophysical sources is sufficient to observe with detectors on board satellites in orbit above the atmosphere. The highest energy gamma rays are much rarer and require detectors with an area the size of a soccer field, Such detectors can only be built on the ground. These observe gamma rays indirectly by detecting the shower of secondary particles produced when a gamma ray collides with an air molecule in the atmosphere. <br/><br/>The researchers will use a large, instrumented reservoir of water at high altitude-called <br/>""Milagro"" -to detect the secondary particles from gamma-ray showers reaching the ground. The man-made reservoir holds about 5 million gallons of water. The particles produce flashes of light in the water, which are recorded by sensitive detectors called photomultiplier tubes. An opaque black cover over the reservoir keeps out sunlight so that the faint flashes can be detected, and the water is filtered so that it is very clear. Milagro is sensitive to gamma rays primarily with energy between about 100 billion electron-volts and 10 trillion electron-volts (visible light has energies of a few electron-volts). Milagro was built specifically for this purpose by the researchers and their collaborators, primarily with support from NSF. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on using Milagro to explore the unknown VHE behavior of the Universe by way of three principal science topics: emission from gamma-ray bursts, surveying the sky, and studying in more depth the known, but unidentified, sources. Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions known in the Universe, but the details of how they work and the role they play in other high energy phenomena (For example, are they the accelerators of the highest energy cosmic rays?) are still being explored. Learning whether they are capable of creating VHE gamma rays in general, in particular circumstances, or not at all, will constrain gamma-ray burst models and properties of the burst environment. Surveying the sky and studying the unidentified sources go hand in hand. Surveys are the best way to reveal new sources independent of any preconceived notions about VHE emission. Some of these new sources will have clear associations with known objects detected at other wavelengths (for example, radiowaves, optical light, or X-rays) and may or may not produce surprises in terms of their VHE emission. Others, the unidentified sources, hold the greatest potential for the discovery of new objects and phenomena. <br/><br/>The work of this proposal will contribute to the scientific literacy of the public, the educational development of students in the sciences, and the nation's technological infrastructure. The public's curiosity about the Universe creates many opportunities to engage their interest and, in the case of students, participation. Postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, including many from underrepresented groups, play an important part in the research effort. The researchers interact regularly with K-12 students, both as visitors to schools and hosts in their university labs as well as presenting general interest lectures to the public.

Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low-temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, operating deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, they have a world-leading effort with a projected sensitivity reach for 100 GeV/c2 WIMPs in CDMSII of a factor of eight beyond their best published limit. <br/><br/>This proposal from Santa Clara University requests base-program support which will allow for (a) the completion of the CDMSII experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the Soudan Mine, (b) the testing and underground operation in the CDMSII infrastructure at Soudan of two new ?SuperTowers,? each comprised of six next-generation detectors, and (c) a modest effort of long-range R&D to develop and test new hardware and detectors for possible follow-up experiments. <br/><br/>Concerning Broader Impacts, the technical development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors which have increasing applications. In addition, the SuperCDMS collaboration will continue its support of the public outreach program at Soudan, which hosts thousands of visitors each year for tours of the mine and laboratory."
0.11145,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>The largest and most powerful particle collider ever built, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is ready to start its operation at CERN. This will present a big challenge for the whole high energy physics community, both on the experimental and the theoretical side. A huge amount of data will need to be processed, analyzed and then compared with theoretical models and predictions. On the one hand the LHC will test in depth the current Standard Model (SM) of particle physics and search for the last missing particle predicted in the model, the Higgs boson. On the other hand, LHC will give particle physicists the possibility to explore the TeV energy scale for the first time and it will hopefully bring evidence for new phenomena that are not incorporated in the SM. The main objective of the research work presented in this proposal is the development of new theoretical tools for the calculation of multi-particle NLO scattering amplitudes, as well as the direct computation of theoretical predictions for scattering processes necessary for the interpretation of the results at the LHC. For the last two years, the PI has been working on the problem of calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes efficiently. A new method, known as OPP-reduction, has been developed. The PI will use the innovative OPP-method to compute theoretical predictions for processes of interest at the LHC. The PI will also optimize the existing numerical codes used to perform the calculations, in order to improve their efficiency and flexibility. He then hopes to automate the whole process for one-loop computations.<br/>The broader impacts are many. As a discovery machine, LHC will have a strong impact on the media. The PI will organize public presentations, not only directed to science major but to the broader community. A first presentation will explain the main features of the LHC and the challenges of the current models in particle physics and cosmology. A second presentation, ideally during the second year of activity of the LHC, will give an update on the scientific progress, at a very general level.

0.813838,"The mysterious origin of the highest energy particles in the Universe has been designated as one of the primary outstanding problems in the physical sciences of this new Millenium. These elusive particles arrive at Earth from unknown sources in deep space. Their energies are 100,000,000 times greater than the most energetic particles produced in particle accelerators on Earth. Moreover, their energies exceed what has been inferred in any astrophysical setting. Arriving almost equally from all directions, we deduce that they do not originate in our Milky Way Galaxy. On the other hand, their interactions with cosmic microwave radiation should render the universe almost opaque to the most energetic of these particles, so that understanding how they can reach us from cosmic distances is a profound puzzle. Although they have been the subject of intense pursuit by science teams for several decades, our understanding of these highest energy cosmic rays remains hampered by their exceptional rarity. We are trying to study particles that arrive only once a century per square kilometer. Our method is to collect them with a detector array, called the Pierre Auger Observatory that, when completed, will span 3000 square kilometers in Argentina. <br/><br/>The Auger Observatory's cumulative data set at the highest energies, obtained during the construction phase of the project, already exceeds that of any previous cosmic ray experiment. This data set will expand by more than an order of magnitude over the next three years. One major advantage of Auger is that it utilizes simultaneously for the first time both techniques traditionally used by previous experiments to determine the energy of the primary cosmic ray. First, an array of detectors on the ground samples and detects the cascade of particles, or ""air shower,"" produced in the atmosphere by the interactions of the primary cosmic ray. On dark nights, special telescopes also image the pattern of nitrogen fluorescence, or sky glow, generated by the passage of the particle cascade through the atmosphere. These detection methods have complementary advantages and limitations, so that by combining them we will be in a position to minimize the systematic uncertainties inherent in either technique alone. In this manner, we have the best possible measurements of these rarest of particles. We will determine if there are protons, heavy atomic nuclei, photons, neutrinos, or possibly more exotic objects. The Auger group at Penn State University has experimental and analytical expertise in both detection techniques. We will conduct a variety of studies, both experimental and analytical, which will address some of the primary questions that must be resolved in minimizing the uncertainties in the combination of the two techniques. For instance, it is crucial to reduce the systematic uncertainty in fluorescence energy assignments, which result partly from uncertainty in the air fluorescence yield and partly from uncertainty in detector calibration. It is also essential to minimize uncertainty in atmospheric modeling. We will conduct a five-prong program of experimental work aimed at reducing fluorescence detection energy uncertainties. We will also continue to be heavily involved in the Auger spectrum analysis and in resolving the apparent discrepancy between the energy reconstruction of the two techniques. We will concentrate particular effort on areas of analysis in which we have special strengths and interests: anisotropy studies and the search for neutrinos near 10^18 eV or above. <br/><br/>High energy cosmic ray observations are an important domain of astrophysics that will produce new insights about extreme processes in the universe. Exciting news in cosmology and high energy astrophysics will be the theme of a week-long summer workshop that we are developing for high school teachers in Pennsylvania, to be offered in each of 3 consecutive years. The concepts of basic college physics are interwoven into the curriculum, so teachers strengthen their working knowledge of their core curriculum while getting an inside look at what is happening at the forefront of astrophysics research. We will take advantage of existing infrastructure and experience at Penn State from similar workshops in astronomy, chemistry and material sciences, and we will work with our colleagues in particle physics and particle astrophysics who have expressed a common interest in this endeavor."

Ultimately, only astrophysical observations can determine whether WIMPs exist in nature, but the importance of direct detection of WIMP-nucleus scattering in laboratory experiments is well recognized.

XENON100 is built on the design and technology established with the XENON10 prototype, with a factor of ~10 increase in total Xe mass. XENON100 is an experiment that can be built with minimum risk, giving first physics results by 2009, when the LHC will be searching for Supersymmetric dark matter. <br/><br/>Among the Broader Impacts of this work, the XENON science has all the ingredients to captivate the interest and imagination of students and the general public alike.

TAUWER is a two-layer scintillator sampling telescope to detect the upward-moving air showers from tau hadronic decays. The hadronic decay channel of the tau-lepton makes possible a simple detection scheme based on identifying gammas, electrons and muons and determining their spatial density around the shower axis.

0.271728,"This award will provide funds for two groups to participate in the planning for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST is a facility under consideration that will address the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are observed to be fundamental components of the Universe that do not fit within the otherwise stunningly successful Standard Model of particle physics. LSST will address these issues in a uniquely powerful way and is planned to be the most ambitious sky survey in the visible band. It will be a large, wide-field, ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky. The survey will feature precision astrometry and photometry and thus will be ideal for measurements of weak lensing and the construction of transient object light curves which is ideal for Supernovae Ia cosmology.<br/><br/>The PIs are members of the LSST project and besides their work on the LSST calibration system they are also members of the LSST Supernova and Large Scale Structure Science collaborations. They are working on a simulation of the LSST calibration to define parameters for design and construction, and during the time frame of this award this work will transition to implementation of a calibration pipeline which will be tested on both simulated LSST raw data and real sky data.<br/><br/>There are several broader impacts of this activity.

The PI proposes to study supersymmetric versions of the five dimensional Randall-Sundrum world brane scenario that has interesting features and may bring in some new ideas about the stability of brane configurations. The theories of gauged supergravities in five and six dimensions have not been explored in the past. It has become clear over the last few years that attempts of embedding world branes into supersymmetric theories are incomplete since not all versions of five and six dimensional gauged supergravities have been constructed. The PI proposes to study 5d supergravities with tensor multiplets and to consider the consequences for supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane world scenarios. Another aspect of the proposal is related to developments with gauged supergravities in various dimensions, including nine The PI proposes a new version of 9d gauged supergravity where it has been found that domain walls exist. This theory will be explored in the context of brane worlds as well as for cosmology.

Scenarios alternative to Standard Model physics may also affect the electron spectrum and have further consequences such as an alteration of signals in solar neutrino detectors similar to what has been observed. This investigation of neutrino properties could have profound effects on cosmology through the dark matter problem."
0.2,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. When the Advanced Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) reaches designed sensitivity as scheduled, the burst of radiation that may become the first detection of gravitational waves is already closer to the Earth than the closest star, Alfa Centauri. The gravitational waves in this first detection, and others following soon after, were very likely produced during the merger of binary systems involving black holes and/or neutron stars. There is realistic optimism that, at the turn of the decade, enough of these and other sources will be observed to state with confidence that proper observational gravitational wave physics has arrived. This will of course depend on having in place exquisite interferometric engineering, clever analysis of extremely noisy data, and state of the art source modeling. Regarding the latter, it is imperative to continue exploiting the tools of numerical relativity to model not only as many gravitational wave source scenarios as possible, but also to improve the physics content captured by the simulations. The science in this project supports directly this enterprise, namely numerical relativity modeling to enhance our understanding of sources of gravitational radiation and of gravitational phenomena driving electromagnetic signatures. The proposed research will have an impact beyond the confines of gravitational wave physics and numerical relativity. Achieving success in the multi-messenger, computing, and data-analytics projects in this project necessitates an interdisciplinary environment reaching across astrophysics, computing science and even engineering. The Center for Relativistic Astrophysics at Georgia Tech will be capable of providing such an environment since its mission is to foster research and education linking high-energy astrophysics, astro-particle physics, cosmology and gravitational wave physics.<br/><br/>This award supports research focused on the computational modeling of black holes and neutron stars as sources of gravitational radiation. The proposal considers several projects that involve astrophysics with a common denominator -- the crucial role played by dynamical gravity and the curvature of space-time. The astrophysical phenomena in these projects arise from a marriage between general relativistic gravitation and complex multi-physics involving fluid flows, electromagnetic fields, radiation transport and realistic equations of state. The effort also aims at enhancing our comprehensive understanding of astrophysical phenomena beyond what gravitational waves alone will be able to tell, in other words, electromagnetic and gravitational wave phenomena leading to multi-messenger observations. The research is organized into two areas: 1) Compact object binaries and a sandbox of simulation data; and 2) Tidal stellar disruptions by massive black holes. The proposed work will give postdocs and students the opportunity to interact with researchers in computing science and engineering, to develop and implement numerical algorithms for magneto-hydrodynamics, work with large data sets and to participate in a variety of outreach activities. The experience gained in high performance computing, optimization, data analytics, and software engineering will further the careers of young researchers participating in the effort, acquiring valuable skills that are in demand in a broad range of professions."

0.1,"Entanglement, the unique property of quantum mechanics that prevents the description of a system by just looking at the properties of its individual components, is a centerpiece in current research in diverse areas of physics spanning from quantum information science to condensed matter physics to quantum field theory. The main objective of this research is to understand the role of entanglement in the description of the quantum nature of space-time. This works investigates fundamental puzzles in theoretical physics such as the description of the primordial state of the universe and the fate of information in black hole evaporation. The focus is on universal aspects of space-time entanglement that can provide valuable insights for any theory of quantum gravity. <br/><br/>At the Planck scale new quantum effects that go beyond Einstein's general relativity are expected to dominate. Loop quantum gravity is one of the leading candidate theories for describing the physics in these regimes. In this theory, space-time has a granular structure that arises as a foam-like excitation of a topologically invariant vacuum. From this perspective, space-time is made of 'elementary constituents' and, as in condensed matter physics, it can have different quantum phases. The main open problem is to identify the quantum phase that describes our smooth extended space-time. A set of techniques that were recently developed in condensed matter physics will be used to study the amount of entanglement between quantum geometry degrees of freedom. This research will directly address the question of the quantum nature of space-time. The results of this research on entangled-network states will provide the basis for extracting physical properties of space-time states in quantum gravity. Three directions will be investigated. The first regards the Minkowski space-time state where the entangled-network state is obtained via a variational ansatz for the minimization of the ADM energy. The second direction regards the use of entangled-network states in quantum cosmology, the study of entanglement near classical singularities, and the thermalization time of subsystems in the de Sitter expansion phase. The third direction regards black hole space-times, the relation between entanglement entropy and black hole entropy, and the dynamics of entanglement entropy in the evaporation process."

Eventually, they expand to tremendous size, throw off their atmosphere, and die. In the process, the stars become ""planetary nebulae"" (PN), beautiful formations of glowing gas that are lit up by the stars' last embers. When viewed at great distances, one cannot see the details of these nebulae. However one can use the PN's distinctive emission to investigate a host of problems in astrophysics and cosmology.

0.086467,"AST-0632901<br/>Albrecht<br/><br/>The discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe has galvanized physicists and astronomers, because it clearly requires new physics, either in exotic states of matter or as a modification of the fundamental theory of gravity. Although exciting and complementary experiments are already being proposed, the theoretical issues are so poorly understood that it is hard to set quantitative goals by which to judge the likely impact of different approaches. The National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Energy (DOE), together chartered a Dark Energy Task Force (DETF), through the federal advisory committee mechanism, to try to plan a sensible approach to determining the nature of dark energy. In order to make both quantitative and comparable assessments, the DETF has developed a metric, which is sure to cause considerable debate. It is essential to have such a figure-of-merit for evaluating experimental approaches to dark energy, but any specific choice is based on a selection of a theoretical framework (a parameterization).<br/><br/>This project is an attempt to bring the issue of quantitative science goals for dark energy experiments to a new level. The results should be available soon after the DETF report is released, so that they can inform the discussion and acceptance of the report. The work will advance attempts to understand the dark energy, but will also allow students to contribute to this exhilarating topic, rated as ""the most exciting science question of our time"" by Science magazine. There is also a good chance to contribute significant assistance towards creating a more focused and effective experimental program. New metrics for dark energy experiments could transform the field, because of the current lack of any well-established, agreed-upon standards.

The lexicography database will include accurate information about the sound structure, morphology, and grammatical properties of each entry form; information about sentence types in which each word root can be used; and cultural and ethnographic information. Simultaneously, a separate verb database with morphological and syntactic information, already begun by the Principal Investigator, will be further elaborated, and syntactic hypotheses developed on the basis of previous work will be checked against new data. The project will incorporate extensive information from a minimum of four Maa dialects during the funding period. The first stage of the current project will focus on the variety of Maa spoken by the IlKeekonyokie section, which, geographically, is on the eastern-to-central part of the Kenyan Maasai area. The project will then expand to the IlWuasinkishu section, which lies on the western edge of the Kenyan territory. Thirdly, it will incorporate a North Maa dialect (Samburu or Camus), and then a Tanzanian variety, such as Arusa Maasai. These four varieties are chosen because of the Principal Investigator's past work on two of them and connections with native speakers, and geographic distribution from the north to south, and east to west extremes of the Maa area. In all cultures there is both basic and specialized vocabulary which describes activities, traditions, cosmology, religion, and the myriad ways of life specific to that culture. These features cannot be thoroughly understood without an understanding of the vocabulary which expresses the concepts comprising the traditions of the culture.

Recent archaeological discoveries have lent support to the argument that scenes of prisoner torture, sacrifice, mutilation, and dismemberment present in Moche iconography may depict actual events. Studying the relationship between actual and idealized ritual behavior will result in a more complete understanding of the interrelationships between Moche technology, iconography, and ideology in particular, and of Moche culture in general. This project will provide the baseline data necessary to address larger issues such as Moche socio-political relationships and religious cosmology. <br/> In this proposed study, macroscopic and microscopic techniques will be used to analyze cut mark morphology and patterning from human skeletal remains excavated from Moche sacrificial contexts. The human remains included in the primary data sample are from the Huaca de la Luna in the Moche Valley, El Brujo in the Chicama Valley, and Dos Cabezas in the Jequetepeque Valley. For comparative purposes, human bones from a Lambayeque (A.D. 800-1375) mass burial and butchered faunal remains from Moche and Lambayque sites are included in this study. Cut marks will be recorded in terms of frequency, location, morphology, length, orientation relative to one another and to the long axis of the bone, anatomical association, and inferred activity. Casts of selected cut marks will be examined under a light microscope and a scanning electron microscope to record more detailed information on cut mark morphology and tool type (i.e., metal vs. stone).<br/> This dissertation research project will address questions of cut mark frequencies, patterning, differential treatment of sacrificial victims, and tool type. It will also compare the patterns of cut mark location and frequency on human remains with those on butchered camelid remains and look for changes in the treatment of sacrificial victims cross-culturally through time. In addition, this project will include an examination of cut mark patterns to see if they can be used to identify different types of ritual activities, and how the physical evidence compares with iconographic representations of ritual behavior."
0.266382,"ABSTRACT<br/>AST- 0071276<br/>Turner<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to obtain IR Brackett-line spectroscopy, 10-micron and 20-micron observations using the Keck telescope, and VLA synthesis images at 1 and 2cm for between 6 and 12 nearby galaxies which have bright radio continuum emission at 1 cm. These will be used to study the emission from star-forming regions in these objects. The data will provide a substantive base for the interpretation of future ground-based (the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and inferred observations from the South Pole) and deep, space-based (SOFIA/SIRTF ) surveys where the 10 micron region will be redshifted to100 microns.<br/><br/>A dramatic mode of star formation is the starburst, in which star formation appears to proceed via large clusters rather than the sparse open clusters that currently form in the Milky Way. These ""super star clusters"" are likely precursors to globular clusters. Globular clusters in the Milky are all old, and there are indications that the early universe may have preferred to form these large clusters. The formation of super star clusters can be studied by observing the very youngest large star-forming regions, which are closest to their birth conditions. These regions are usually visually obscured by dust and gas clouds. The goal of this project is the detection of star formation in nearby galaxies in the infrared and radio wavelengths where star clusters and nebulae are not as affected by extinction as they are in the visible. Free-free radio continuum observations with the Very Large Array radio telescope will be used to map out radio nebulae surrounding young stars. Hidden nebulae can also be revealed by the mid-infrared emission from dust warmed by intense starlight from these clusters. With the Keck Telescope, nearby starbursts will be imaged in the mid-infrared at resolutions sufficient to distinguish gaseous nebulae from young star clusters. The first step is to locate the youngest super star clusters in nearby galaxies, where they are relatively easy to study. This is the major goal of this research. Eventually, once the locations of these clusters and their nebulae have been established, the imaging of gas clouds near the nebulae will show the relation of the clusters to their natal gas, which may reveal the trigger for the star formation. This is a topic that can be fruitfully explored with the future Atacama Large Millimeter Array telescope. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"

0.100001,"The main research objectives of this proposal are related to the field of high-dimensional statistics such as sparse regression or low rank matrix estimation problems which have recently attracted a lot of attention. The investigator intends to develop new methodologies and novel applications and extend the scope of applications for penalized empirical risk minimization, empirical processes and exponential weights estimators. The investigator studies in particular the minimax rates in the noisy matrix completion problem and intends to adapt successful techniques from matrix completion problem to the covariance estimation problem and determine the minimax rate for this problem under the low rank assumption.<br/><br/><br/>The theoretical results developed in this research project are expected to have broader applications as well. The new research results can be applied in many fields: econometrics, marketing, data mining, quantum physics, cosmology, genomic, tomography, climatology and many other fields that require efficient tools for exploring high-dimensional data sets. In particular, a question of crucial interest in all these applications is to determine the set of active variables among a huge set of potential candidates. In genomic, micro-array chip contain the expression of thousands of genes and the goal is to find the few genes responsible for the synthesis of a particular molecule among the entire pool of tested genes. This difficult problem can be tackled efficiently through the techniques studied in this research project."
0.0895,"Introduction<br/>This project will examine the role of vitalistic (life-force) principles in Kepler's astronomy. Though often considered an early forerunner of the mechanical world view in light the celestial physics presented in his New Astronomy (1609), which offers only a limited view of his system of astronomical causes. By contrast, his study of the supernova of 1604, On the New Star (1606), Kepler compares the origins of comets and 'new stars' to the products of a cyclical process of decay and renewal occurring in the body of an animal. Kepler's application of anatomical knowledge to the ethereal body of the heavens suggests a broader understanding of his celestial physics, one that makes better sense of the dynamic course of the cosmos as a whole. Begun after the bulk of the New Astronomy was already complete, On the New Star was a counterpart, rather than a 'less modern' qualification, of Kepler's pioneering conception of planetary forces.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This project will shed new light on the relation of Kepler's two texts, elucidating the inseparable links between his ideas of agency in astronomy and other areas of interest, especially astrology and music. By comparing Kepler's ideas with those of his intellectual contemporaries, this project will also deepen and diversify our understanding of early modern physics more generally, challenging us to bridge gaps between ideas of agency and cause in the fields of mathematics, medicine, and natural philosophy.<br/><br/>Potential Broader Impacts<br/>The results of this research will ultimately lead to two primary products: (1) a monograph study of Kepler's vitalistic views over the course of his career, and (2) the first-ever English translation, with an introduction and notes, of Kepler's On the New Star. In each of these efforts, the PI will work towards breaking down the modern dichotomy of vitalistic and mechanistic principles and restoring their close and complex links in the context of early modern science. This will be done in large part by building on the recent studies of seventeenth-century anatomy and medicine and drawing attention to their relevance for Kepler's astronomy and other 'less modern' areas of interest. While the monograph study will appeal to a wide variety of historians and philosophers of science, the translation of Kepler's On the New Star will attract an even wider audience of scholars, students, and scientific enthusiasts more generally."

The NSF fellows choose from research opportunities in astrophysics, complex (dusty) plasmas, early universe cosmology, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, space physics, superstring physics or surface physics providing clear intellectual merit for the proposed activity. In all of these areas, fellows are involved in advanced scientific research with many of their activities being interdisciplinary in nature and thus acting across several scientific fields. Over the course of the program, fellows are encouraged to become self sufficient in their research agenda. This goal is realized in part by the research team setting already in place along with individual mentor attention which is a hallmark of the program. Social integration is also strongly encouraged using opening and closing banquets, twice-weekly seminars, social activities, an end of the summer Undergraduate Research Symposium and specially designed classes in various physics research fields of interest. Collaborative research opportunities after the REU fellow returns to his or her home institution are also available as is partial stipend support for returning to Baylor during the academic year. REU fellows are selected from a national application pool at universities around the nation, with undergraduate students from smaller undergraduate institutions with little and historically minority institutions. The program also provides four to seven RET fellowships, funded at two months of annualized salary per MPS guidelines. RET fellows are selected from a national applicant pool and reside on-site for approximately eight weeks. RET fellows participate throughout the summer with researchers and faculty within CASPER, work with NSF REU fellows and attend all weekly NSF meetings. At the same time, they are also given the resources (including educational materials developed at CASPER, the Jet Propulsion Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Sandia National Lab, the Johnson Space Center and the Texas Space Grant Consortium) to develop new and exciting curriculum modules to take back into their classrooms.

In addition a comprehensive introductory course will be developed and taught at Cornell to graduate students and interested faculty, covering the various aspects of gravitational wave astronomy: the physical properties of the waves as predicted by general relativity, the experimental technology to detect them, the catalogue of anticipated sources, and the information we hope to extract from the waves about the nature of gravity, about cosmology, and about the various sources. The lecture notes will be made available on the world wide web so as to be accessible to a wide audience beyond Cornell. These web pages will be periodically updated to bring them up to date with the latest theoretical and experimental research in the field, thus tying the educational facility closely to current research.

0.502191,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This award provides support to Washington University in St. Louis in their effort to build an extremely sensitive and versatile torsion balance. The instrument will probe possible deviations from the inverse square law of Newtonian gravity at sub-millimeter distances, and study Casimir forces, which are macroscopic manifestations of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum. The torsion balance that will be built is comprised of a gold-coated aluminum disk, suspended by its edge with a fine torsion fiber, inside a high vacuum chamber. The suspended disk is viewed by an auto collimating optical lever of sub-nanoradian resolution. A large circular sheet of gold acts as a source of the force fields under study. This plate will be mounted in close proximity to the disk, with its face nearly parallel to it. It will be moved to and fro, and also in a yaw-like oscillation through a small angle, while the response of the suspended disk is being continuously recorded by the optical lever. The frequency, amplitude and phase of the angular oscillations of the suspended disk carry information about any deviations from Newtonian gravity and the Casimir force at sub-millimeter length scales.<br/><br/>These experiments will probe the finite temperature corrections to the Casimir force and any deviations from the inverse square law of gravity, such as those predicted by new theories of particle physics, including those that postulate extra spatial dimensions. These new theories attempt to unify gravitation with electromagnetic, nuclear and the weak forces, and suggest the existence of hitherto undiscovered particles that can act as dark matter dominating the formation and the dynamics of galaxies. The Casimir force is a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum vacuum that could be related to the dark energy responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Thus, any confirmed deviations from the inverse square law will have a large impact on knowledge of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The experimental effort and the instrumentation are highly interdisciplinary, involving vacuum technology, optics, mechanical engineering, signal analysis, and of course, physics. This project provides an excellent training ground for post-doctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students.

Perceptual causality, human intents and physics are generally applicable to all categories of object, scene, action and events, i.e., transportable across datasets. These entities and relations are deeper, and more invariant, than geometry and appearance - the dominating features used in visual recognition. iii) Developing joint representation and joint inference algorithm.

Such an improved calibration will provide critical data for the determination of the Hubble constant, which in turn will provide insights into the properties of the Universe as a whole; i.e., cosmology. The specific projects are intended to provide: 1) New distances and reddening estimates to galaxies for which Cepheids have already been discovered. 2) The discovery of new Cepheids in southern-hemisphere galaxies, with the intent of increasing the number of galaxies upon which the determination of the Hubble constant rests. 3) An investigation into the possible systematic effects of metallicity of the Cepheids on the calibration of the Cepheid distance scale."
0.0225,"The theory of nonlinear wave equations has long played a prominent role in physics and applied mathematics, for instance in theories of gases and liquids, in the theory of elementary particles, and in cosmology. Their mathematical study goes back to Riemann, but methods of analysis were not sufficiently developed for a systematic study until the 1960's. In this decade there were several major breakthroughs, including the beginnings of theories of global existence, blow up, solitons, scattering, the inverse scattering method, and shock waves. The subject has continued to undergo rapid change. Major developments in the 1980's have included the study of important special systems like the Minkowski-Yang-Mills equations and the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, the development of a stability theory of solitary waves, and general results on solutions of small amplitude and on the propagation of weak singularities. This conference will be devoted to nonlinear wave equations. Walter A. Strauss, one of the principal architects of the subject, will be the main speaker and will deliver a series of ten lectures."
0.084,"As a Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins University, the co-principal investigator (co-PI) will study and teach under the supervision of Professor Lawrence M. Principe (PI), a leading scholar in the history of science internationally recognized for his research contributions and teaching achievements. In addition to providing the co-PI the opportunity to co-teach courses in early modern science, the PI will oversee the studies of the co-PI on the history of astronomy in seventeenth-century Europe. The author of two recently published books celebrated for having stood ""the traditional view of science on its head"", the PI's investigation of the alchemical origins of modern chemistry strongly resonates with the revisionist objectives of the co-PI: in studying the multi-disciplinary implications of the supernova of 1604, the co-PI will not undermine the standards of modern astronomy, but enrich our understanding of its origins and its broad interdisciplinary influences in art, astrology, chronology, politics, and theology in early modern Europe.<br/><br/>Johannes Kepler's De stella nova (1606) will constitute the core text in the co-PI's comprehensive study of interpretations of the supernova of 1604 by scholars across Europe. In preparing the first-ever English translation of the De stella nova, the co-PI will write an interlocking series of articles on the many significances of the work in the light of the contrasting (and often critical) opinions of Kepler's intellectual contemporaries. Beginning with the recently published ""Kepler vs. the Epicureans"" (2007), this series of articles will culminate in 2010 in the completion of an English translation (with an introduction, notes, and an annotated inventory of published works on the supernova). The co-PI will incorporate these studies into courses co-taught with the PI, who will also provide supervision and support for the organization of an international symposium on the historical and scientific importance of the supernova. As an expression of the wide array of interests involved in such a comprehensive consideration of the De stella nova, articles will be submitted to a selection of journals spanning the history of art, politics, science, and theology, in order to reach and interest the widest possible audience in the multifaceted importance of the topic. <br/><br/>In addition to its importance for the history of astronomy specifically and the history of science more generally, the De stella nova casts much light on several other fields of study. As the last supernova observed in our galaxy, Kepler's supernova is still the focus of intense astronomical research, recently renewed by the commemoration of the quatercentenary of its appearance. Although the supernova remains closely connected with Kepler, the De stella nova continues to be misunderstood by humanist and scientific scholars as ""quirky and much less modern"" than his other works. It attracts the attention of art and political historians, who appreciate it as emblematic of the Mannerist court culture of Kepler's powerful political patron, Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II. Biblical and chronological scholars point to the De stella nova as a pioneering study of the birth date of Christ, crediting Kepler with the confirmation of a year ""four years after the customary [one]"" and precisely 1,600 years before the appearance of the supernova. Finally, Kepler's insightful and sensitive criticism of celestial forecasts stemming from the supernova provides ample ground for studying how astronomical, astrological, and political themes intersected in the early modern period.

Some of these topics (for example, many electron atoms, weak interactions) relate closely to interpretation of ongoing or planned experiments in this country or abroad. Others (such as effective Gaussian potentials) address purely theoretical questions that may in the future lead to experimental tests.

0.009,"What does cognitive science have to tell us about the role of evidence and argumentation in science? Over the past twenty or more years, cognitive science has been analyzing belief and persuasion. Dr. Margolis has taken what he has learned in cognitive science and applied it to an analysis of belief change -- i.e. ""scientific revolutions"" -- in science. He is specifically applying his understanding of cognitive science to the paradigm case of change in belief in science: the Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Such analyses of these well-studied areas promise to have important and provocative implications for history and philosophy of science as well as for cognitive science. Under this grant, Dr. Margolis will examine three different aspects of the Scientific Revolution: 1) how persuasive was the status of the Copernican argument as it stood in 1633; 2) why astronomers were unlikely to accept the authority of non- astronomers on cosmology; and 3) how other kinds of evidence such as the discovery of America affected arguments for Copernicanism. These points go directly to the level of evidence needed for scientists to become persuaded of the accuracy of a new theory. According to Dr. Margolis, this level of evidence is much less than we have earlier supposed. If his research bears out his theory, our understanding of the processes of persuasion, using both qualitative and quantitative evidence, and theory change in science should be greatly improved."
0.253654,"AST 0206216<br/>Kravtsov<br/><br/>One of the greatest challenges of modern astrophysics is understanding how galaxies such as our own Milky Way form within the framework of the Big Bang cosmology. The current theory of structure formation (called the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario) predicts that massive galaxies were built from smaller galaxies that collided and merged, inducing bursts of star formation and resulting in the different types of galaxies observed today. This entire sequence of events is thought to be seeded by quantum fluctuations in the very early Universe and governed by mysterious ""dark matter"" which constitutes about 85% of all matter in the universe. While the CDM theory is successful in explaining many observations, it faces an increasing number of problems which may lead us to revise or even abandon this paradigm.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental, unanswered questions is whether realistic galaxies with properties similar to those of observed galaxies can be formed in the CDM model. This project will specifically focus on stellar feedback and heavy element enrichment and their role in the evolution of galaxies. Dr. Kravtsov and his collaborators will address this question by using very high-resolution, state-of-the-art computer simulations which include all the main processes thought to be important in galaxy. In particular, the simulations will account for the release of enormous amounts of energy and heavy elements into the surrounding gas by the explosions of young, massive stars. This energy release, or ""feedback"", is thought to play a critical role in controlling the rate at which interstellar gas is turned into stars and in shaping the overall properties of galaxies. <br/>***"

Funds are provided only to facilitate the coordination outlined below, maintain shared scientific equipment, and operate the machine shop to meet the needs of the science projects and the station. No funds are provided for activities that are covered by the individual investigator grants. The SCOARA, comprised of principal investigators involved in cosmology and astrophysics projects at the station, will enable the scientists to work together for: (a) providing community organization, coordination, and expert sharing of scientific support for approved South Pole Dark Sector science projects, (b) outfitting and staffing the shared Dark Sector machine shop, (c) keeping the shared scientific equipment at the Pole in good working order, (d) providing expert science winterover support shared among the projects, (e) conducting weekly teleconferences for Principal Investigators or their designees to address on-going and emerging issues related to the science projects at the Pole, and (f) educating, organizing, and coordinating the community in response to discussions about the limited support resources at the South Pole. With respect to the broader impacts, the proposed Science Coordination Office will focus on fostering, amongst the community, the goal of maintaining worldwide leadership, at the cutting edge of modern science, of the U.S. Antarctic astronomy and astrophysics programs. SCOARA will have an impact on understanding how the worldwide astronomical community might expand observations to sites in Antarctica where observing conditions might be even better than at South Pole. In addition, SCOARA would make it easier for new astrophysics projects (e.g., projects that receive new funding from NSF) to begin their operations at South Pole. This will be especially useful for smaller projects that are often associated with younger investigators. Finally, SCOARA also has obvious advantages for addressing education and public outreach issues, being better suited to organize outreach around a common theme relative to the efforts that individual projects could make separately."

The discovery and study of glueballs is one of the most important areas of nuclear/particle physics. Using QCD, we are investigating possible states of mesons and glueballs with emphasis on identifying experiments to test our theoretical picture. Of particular importance is our recent prediction of a low-mass glueball which we feel is strongly coupled to a two-pion resonance, called the Sigma. We are investigating decay rates of particles which will provide tests of this theory of the glueball/sigma. It is possible to carry out some of these experimental tests at Jefferson Laboratory.<br/> We are also carrying out investigations of the Pomeron, whose exchange has long been known to dominate high energy elastic and diffractive processes. It is almost certain that the Pomeron is composed largely of glue, and recently our group has given strong evidence that the Pomeron is closely related to glueballs, including our proposed glueball/sigma. We shall calculate cross sections for sigma production to test the nature of the Pomeron. Experiments could be carried out at the 50 GeV accelerators proposed at Los Alamos Laboratory and in Japan. The proton-proton collider, using the RHIC facility at Brookhaven Laboratory, would be excellent for experimental measurements of the cross sections.<br/> Properties of hadrons at finite densities and temperatures are also being investigated. We have completed a preliminary study for hadronic matter at temperatures below the chiral phase transition, which occurs at the temperature of the universe about a millionth of a second after the so-called big bang. We shall study the effect of instantons, certain gluonic modes, on the properties of matter both below and above this phase transition, and propose tests at the RHIC accelarator. We shall also investigate possible evidence for this early-universe phase transition in observational studies of the cosmic microwave background.

The PI proposes four projects: (1) to search for quasars at redshift>5 to determine when they first become visible, how rapidly their space density evolves, and how they relate to the formation of galaxies. (2) to investigate the luminosity function of quasars at redshift=2 down to absolute magnitudes similar to those of nearby AGNs, thereby constraining their evolution between the present and the epoch when more luminous quasars reach a peak in the evolution of their space density.

0.249417,"ABSTRACT <br/>AST 0098419<br/>Sparke<br/><br/><br/>Most of the Universe's mass emits no light; we know of its existence only through its gravitational pull on the luminous stars and gas. Within galaxies, this `dark matter' is most influential in the outer parts. This project will study polar ring galaxies. In these, a huge ring of gas, stars and dust encircles a rotating inner disk of stars, much like our own Milky Way -- but the ring stands perpendicular to the central disk. The motions of stars and gas in both the ring and the central galaxy are controlled by gravitational forces, including those of the `dark halo' of non-luminous matter. If the dark halo is roughly spherical, gas in the ring should orbit in circles around the galaxy center, while if the dark stuff lies in a Milky-Way-like disk, the ring will be squashed into an oval by its gravitational force. From observations these motions, the investigators will determine whether the halo is roughly round, or forms a flattened disk. The latter finding would support the idea that the dark material is 'normal' matter (such as burned-out stars), rather than weakly-interacting particles that have not yet been observed on Earth.<br/><br/>The investigators also intend to study another gravitational problem: the orbits of stars that experience a gravitational force that is not always the same, but varies with time. An example is that of a star belonging to a small galaxy that follows an elliptical orbit around a much larger galaxy -- our Milky Way has several such satellites. As the satellite swoops in low, the increased gravitational force of the Milky Way can remove stars from its outer regions. The PI has developed a novel method, that of 'invariant loops', that will be used to tackle this problem, and to find which stars will remain with the satellite and which will be stripped from it. It will then be possible to use observations of stars around these small galaxies, now being gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and other surveys, to measure the gravitational force of the satellite galaxy in comparison to that of the Milky Way. In this way the masses of the satellites can be estimated and their 'dark matter' content calculated.

Furthermore, we now know that the universe is made up mostly of a mysterious ""dark energy"" (70%) with the remaining mass consisting of some kind of dark matter (25%) and ordinary matter (5%). This model has passed impressive tests at physical scales larger than that of galaxy clusters. However, at galaxy scales, the current paradigm is not as successful.

Preliminary simulations by Dr Jimenez and his collaborators have shown that such objects can displace a significant amount of dark matter from the centers of galaxies. These preliminary calculations will be extended and refined with the aim of testing whether the standard paradigm can be reconciled with the observations. In addition, this project will investigate the nature of the elusive dark matter particles.

One of the principal goals of studying intergalactic metals is to put limits on the earliest star formation, making it important to trace the metals as far back as possible. This project will obtain the highest possible signal-to-noise observations of the brightest known quasars between redshifts four and six, to determine the distributions of intergalactic ions to the deepest possible level. The new HIRES spectrograph implementation on the Keck 10-meter telescope has outstanding red sensitivity and wide wavelength coverage, providing the best available spectra for this study. Optimal analysis techniques developed under the principal investigator's previous NSF award can then be used to measure the ion densities, distributions, and ionizations at these high redshifts.<br/><br/>These results will have a broad impact on physical cosmology and theoretical modeling of the formation of the first stars and galaxies.

0.250001,"AST 0098480<br/>Cowie, A.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, numerical models of the growth of structure in the Universe have made vast strides in understanding how the first stars and galaxies in the Universe formed from initial density perturbations. One of the great successes of these models has been in revolutionizing our understanding of the intergalactic gas (IGM) as revealed to us in the ""forest"" of Lyman alpha absorption lines and associated metal lines seen in the spectra of distant quasars. Previously, absorption in the IGM was understood in terms of individual clouds in pressure balance within a hot underlying smooth IGM component, or in terms of absorption in individual dark matter mini-haloes at high redshift; now the models have successfully shown that the Lyman alpha forest traces the lower overdensity portions of the ""cosmic web"" of filaments and voids that is the early phase of the buildup of structure --- stars, galaxies and clusters --- in the Universe. The study of quasar absorption lines is thus complementary to the study of high redshift galaxies and clusters, and allows us to see the earliest stages of galaxy formation. Stars form out of he IGM, and it in turn is enriched with heavy elements (""metals"") from these stars as they return materials to the gas. Ionizing radiation from stars, galaxies and quasars also affects the balance of ions of hydrogen and other elements in the IGM. The distribution of metals in the IGM and the distribution of ions are therefore both diagnostics of the star formation history of the Universe. In addition, the models predict that the IGM is where the bulk of the baryons in the Universe exist at high redshift, thus, since this gas is fairly easily observable in quasar absorption lines, we are in the lucky position of being able to account for most of the material in the Universe at high redshift.<br/><br/>This project will be directly concerned with understanding how the IGM comes to be rather uniformly enriched with metals, even at redshifts of 3 and higher. One possibility is that all the metals that have been observed in the Lyman alpha forest come directly from stars that are forming in the first structures that will later become present-day galaxies, but another possibility is that the whole IGM was pre-enriched by a first generation of stars at very early times: the so-called population III. Since the pre-galactic clumps form in the regions of higher overdensity in the IGM, any enrichment from these stars would necessarily be confined also to these higher density regions. In contrast, the population III stars would enrich the IGM more broadly. As numerical models become more sophisticated at incorporating feedback into the IGM from star formation and evolution, their predictions of metallicity as a function of distance form the star-forming site, and therefore of density, will become more refined. There is therefore a clear rationale for investigating the distribution of metals with density, and this will be a main focus of this project.

0.179437,"AST 0098258<br/>Crotts <br/>In the last few years, astronomers have shown that supernovae (SN), in distant galaxies are fainter than expected. The obvious explanation is that they are farther away than we had thought. If true, this implies that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. This change in expansion is attributed to a so called ""vacuum energy"" by theoretical physics. This discovery presents both major new opportunities, and a long list of troubling basic new questions. Up to now Gravity has been the hardest part of physics to understand, in part because it has been described by a single number: the Newtonian gravitational constant G which measures its strength. If the universe is speeding up there must be a second number, which should help us understand gravitational physics. In this way, astronomical observations are redefining our understanding of fundamental physics and the universe as a whole. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to provide an independent check of the claim that 70% of the energy density of the universe is some form of mysterious vacuum energy. Astronomical observations are the only way to explore the vacuum energy experimentally, because the effects are significant only over exceedingly large distances. In particular, this project will provide an independent check of the results from supernovae by using angular size as a distance measure. The amount of clumping of the gas between the galaxies will be measured both along the line of sight, and in angle across the sky. The relationship between the two measures gives the distance and hence the acceleration of the universe. The method is insensitive to changes in the state of the universe over long times. The project is urgent, because the vacuum energy remains an unconfirmed, though very plausible, result, and highly significant, because we will have the sensitivity to decisively rule out the amount of vacuum energy suggested by the supernovae, if none were present. <br/><br/>In addition to providing an independent check on the SN decelerating universe measurement, this project will also give improved measurements of the clumping of gas between galaxies at early times. This clumping is believed to have arisen from primordial quantum fluctuations when the universe was young.. These fluctuations have been measured at different epochs, and in different ways. However, the methods used in the present project will give the only measurement of the amount of clumping of matter on galaxy sized scales at early times. These new data and simulations will be compared with theoretical predictions, to act as a check on recent investigations which suggest that our present ideas about the growth of small scale structure in the universe are inadequate.

With the adaptive optics systems now available, it is possible to obtain two-dimensional surface brightness profiles and color gradients of the most distant and reddest galaxies. Integral field spectroscopy of the extended emission line regions can be compared with dynamical and dust scattering models. Spatially resolved infrared polarimetry will probe the dust content of these objects and its evolution with redshift.

In addition to lensing objects, the surveys will also find intrinsically variable stars (such as Mira variables). <br/><br/>A key question today in astrophysics is what composes the dark matter known to exist in galaxies.

This proposal is to fund a three-year observational program, involving our nearest neighboring, large galaxy, M31 in Andromeda, which will settle the question of whether a large part of galaxy dark matter is composed of stellar massed objects in the halo. These results can be obtained well in advance of competing, proposed approaches, and settle the current quandary within the context of a galaxy separate from our own, indicating whether the MACHO halo is a universal phenomenon.

To conduct this study, this project will significantly augment the census of very distant (z > 4) galaxies using two proven techniques: (1) photometric selection of very high-redshift protogalaxy candidates from deep ground- and space-based imaging. and (2) slit spectroscopic searches for high-redshift line emission on deep exposures. Once these high redshift objects have been found they will be studied to find the cosmic star formation history at z > 5, the prevalence of dust in the early Universe, the surface density and distribution of galaxies at early, cosmic time, and the luminosity function of both photometrically -selected and line-emitting galaxies in the early Universe.

It has been used with ever-increasing sensitivity and resolution to investigate the structure of our own Galaxy and of other disk systems, their interactions with other galaxies, the large-scale structure of the Universe, and the physical conditions of high redshift systems. The recent evolution of 21 cm detectors, spectrometers and multi-feed systems has dramatically expanded both the accessible volume of parameter space and our ability to sample it quickly. The new seven-feed array for the Arecibo telescope enables it to study the HI Universe to unprecedented volumes and low mass levels.<br/><br/>The first part of this research will explore the faint end of the HI mass function, and act as a pilot for the second part, which will carry out, develop the necessary analysis tools for, and process and make publicly accessible the products of, (a) a fast survey of the Arecibo HI sky, (b) a medium-deep survey of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, and (c) a deep extragalactic HI survey in the Zone of Avoidance, all using the Arecibo feed array system. All three surveys lend themselves to synergistic coordination with several different projects, not just the present ones, including studies of Milky Way structure and high velocity clouds, a pulsar search, and the detection of radio continuum transients.<br/><br/>The software tools and data products will be made available to the community, and the research work will provide fertile ground for the training of a new generation of US-based single-dish radio astronomers."

0.312,"Theoretical research on the interface of particle physics and cosmology will be performed over the next five years. Models of particle physics attempting to unify the four fundamental forces necessarily involve energies inaccessible to present day accelerators. In the standard Big Bang model of the early universe, however, extremely high temperatures and densities are present and lend a background for testing unified models. Necessary observational consequences of a unified theory should include, for example, a matter-antimatter asymmetry and the correct abundances of light nuclear isotopes. The resulting goal of such a program is thus to further our understanding of the forces of nature as well as the evolutionary history of the Universe. The work will be carried out by a highly-distinguished young physicist who is one of the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1987."
1.7,"This proposal will fund the search for neutrino-less double beta decay process in Xenon-136. The discovery of neutrino oscillations can be regarded as the first window provided by experiments on physics beyond the standard model. The search for neutrino less double beta decay represents the next step in this exciting field of physics and provides an opportunity to perform transformational science addressing universal topics such as the origin of mass, the role of Dirac?s equation in describing spin half fermions and connections between particle physics and cosmology. Many experiments tackled the double beta decay over the last thirty years, setting half-life limits for this mode of the order of 10**25 years, corresponding to a Majorana neutrino mass just below 1 eV. A new generation of much larger experiments will push this sensitivity to 10**28 years or Majorana masses below 10 meV, exploring much of the parameter space compatible with the oscillation results. Those searches require tones of specific isotopes that, in order to result in viable measurements, must be produced by isotopic enrichment. They also require unprecedented reductions of radioactive backgrounds and substantial attenuation of the cosmic ray flux, making their location deep underground imperative. <br/><br/>This proposal plans to establish the engineering and project management infrastructure to design a full scale double beta decay experiment, the ?Enriched Xenon Observatory? (EXO), using a few tons of the isotope Xenon 136. The isotope choice capitalizes on the relative simplicity of xenon enrichment and purification and on its versatility as a detection medium in a liquid or gas phase Time Projection Chamber. The substantial investment in isotopic enrichment can, in this way, result in more than one detector, making it possible to cross check results and upgrade detectors as new technologies become available. In addition a scheme being developed by the EXO collaboration to tag the atomic final state of the decay has the promise of drastically reducing radioactivity backgrounds. Data soon to be collected with EXO-200 will provide very important input for the design work on a multi-ton detector for DUSEL. <br/><br/>The broader impact plan of the EXO collaboration is to develop a cross-disciplinary program involving the techniques ranging from nuclear/particle detector physics to AMO and surface science. Therefore many intermediate results may have spin-offs in a broad range of fields. EXO R&D has trained students in a variety of disciplines and a vibrant outreach program at several EXO institutions brings the excitement of science to grade school students and to high school teachers who spend their summer in some of our labs. As part of this proposal we plan to enhance this last component, by connecting it with the DUSEL outreach program."
0.222723,"Abstract Proposal DMS-9803493 Principal Investigators: Leon Simon and Brian White Leon Simon proposes to pursue various questions related to the structure of the singular sets of minimal submanifolds and energy minimizing maps, including the extension of his recent work on smoothness of the singular set of area minimizing submanifolds to higher dimensions and to other classes of submanifolds. Specifically, he is proposing to consider the question of whether the top-dimensional part of the singular set locally lies in a finite union of smooth submanifolds, which he has recently established for 3 and 4 dimensional mod-2 minimizing submanifolds in codimension 2. Simon also proposes to continue his efforts to develop methods for generating examples of singular sets, and to pursue several questions related to asymptotics on approach to singularities. In addition he proposes to study questions related to the structure of the branching set of energy minimizing maps. Brian White plans to study how regularity properties and singular structure for minimizing chains with coefficients in a metric group depend on the group and its metric. This includes study of immiscible fluid interfaces as a special case. He also plans to investigate singularities in the mean-curvature flow and in a related hyperbolic flow that should more accurately model the dynamics of real soap films. He will also continue his investigations of branch points in 2 dimensional minimal surfaces. An understanding of singularities, and how singularities are formed, is a fundamental element in the overall understanding of many physical and geometric phenomena. For example, in cosmology singularities of space-time (e.g. ""black holes"") play a fundamental role. Likewise in the study of the ""canonical"" objects which arise naturally in topology and geometry, the understanding of singularities is absolutely fundamental. As with most non-linear phenomena, there is no single well ordered theory which a pplies in a wide range of different contexts. Rather, each different context has its own collection of effective techniques, and it is the development and application of such techniques in the context of the geometric calculus of variations which is the focus of the present research proposal. Specifically, Simon and White propose to continue their efforts toward a complete understanding of singularities, and how they are formed, in the context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy minimizing maps. Such techniques are likely to be applicable to the study of other objects of geometric and physical significance---for example to the study of immiscible fluid interfaces, soap-films, and the equilibrium free surfaces of fluids."
0.30152,The Principal Investigator will study Riemannian metrics of constant scalar curvature and related problems in nonlinear partial differential equations. He will study the geometry of singularities for solutions of differential equations arising from the Yamabe problem. And he will use the Calculus of Variations to analyze blow-ups of solutions to the parabolic equation arising from the harmonic map problem. For many years mathematicians studied geometry with techniques which have their origins in the Calculus. Other mathematicians and physicists used differential equations to understand motion and heat flow. The PI will combine the two techniques to solve various geometric problems arising from heat flow theory and cosmology.

The researchers'<br/>program consists of three ``themes'': The first theme concerns<br/>certain geometric properties of Kleinian groups that are induced<br/>from the existence of the ergodic Liouville measure on the unit<br/>tangent bundle of a geometrically finite hyperbolic manifold. A<br/>primary goal is to pair Liouville theory with quasiconformal<br/>deformation theory to the extent that it is revealing of the<br/>geometry of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures<br/>uniformizing a compact co-infinite hyperbolizable three-manifold.<br/>The second theme details an ongoing program to show that various<br/>analytical, dynamical and topological properties of Kleinian<br/>groups (e.g. the exponent of convergence, Hausdorff dimension,<br/>porosity, etc.) illuminate the action of the group when the group<br/>in question is generalized to a discrete convergence group. In<br/>this setting the researchers are primarily concerned with<br/>discrete quasiconformal groups. The third theme centers around<br/>certain non-equivariant interactions between complex analysis and<br/>hyperbolic geometry; it generalizes the first two themes. The<br/>motivating question is: How does the asymptotic geometry of the<br/>convex hull boundary of a Jordan curve reflect the conformal<br/>geometry of the curve? Under various stronger assumptions the<br/>researchers are investigating aspects of this question from both<br/>a geometric and analytic perspective.<br/><br/>The research described in this proposal resides at the<br/>intersection between hyperbolic geometry and conformal analysis.<br/>These topics form a vast and fundamental area of study in<br/>mathematics which dates back to the 18th century, when it was<br/>developed by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein,<br/>and Poincare. Though this proposal does not directly address<br/>physics, we note that both hyperbolic geometry and conformal<br/>analysis (especially in the guise of Teichmuller theory) have<br/>found recent spectacular application in theoretical physics and<br/>cosmology. The proposers are dedicated researchers and educators,<br/>and Boston College and Wesleyan University both have strong dual<br/>identities as teaching and research institutions. An innovative<br/>component of the proposal is to use its multi disciplinary nature<br/>to introduce motivated undergraduates to areas of mathematics<br/>that are currently not well represented (e.g. geometry and<br/>analysis) in the undergraduate degree programs at the proposers'<br/>respective institutions.

0.060466,"Proposal DMS-0303326<br/>P.I.: Kristopher Tapp (Bryn Mawr College)<br/><br/>Title: Positive and nonnegative curvature on bundles<br/><br/>ABSTRACT:<br/><br/>In recent research, the PI developed tools for studying the following two <br/>general problems in Riemannian geometry: (1) For which vector bundles does <br/>the total space admit a complete Riemannian metric with nonnegative sectional <br/>curvature? (2) For which sphere bundles does the total space admit a <br/>Riemannian metric with positive curvature? The PI plans to use these tools <br/>to find new examples, obstructions, and rigidity theorems. In particular, <br/>the PI plans to construct metrics of nonnegative curvature on holomorphic <br/>vector bundles over complex projective space, and determine whether Einstein-<br/>Hermitian connections can appear as the connections in the normal bundles of <br/>their souls. Also, the PI intends to study nonnegatively curved metrics on <br/>trivial vector bundles over spheres. This problem is related to the Hopf <br/>conjecture, or more specifically to the question: how large is the family of <br/>nonnegatively curved metrics on the product of two spheres? The PI will work <br/>with undergraduate students studying the metrics on such products obtained by <br/>re-scaling the product metric by a compact Lie group which acts by <br/>isometries. Finally, the PI proposes to find obstructions to metrics of <br/>nonnegative curvature on vector bundles over spheres with prescribed soul <br/>metrics.<br/><br/>The question of which manifolds can have nonnegative curvature is central to <br/>Riemannian geometry. Nonnegative curvature is a visually natural restriction <br/>on the way in which an object curves about in space. All known examples come <br/>from compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics, which are indispensable <br/>tools in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, and other <br/>disciplines in which simplification is achieved through symmetry. The search <br/>for new examples of manifolds with nonnegative (or positive) curvature has a <br/>long history, yet very few constructions are known. Since his tools <br/>represent a construction which is substantially different form known methods, <br/>the PI believes they deserve further study."

The award provides funds to support undergraduate participation in the overall research effort, which is being funded separately by the DoE under contract UC Berkeley Renewal of Grant DE-FG02-06ER54904 . <br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this collaborative research is to measure the relative spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. A second, more remote goal is to measure the relative effects of gravity on hydrogen and antihydrogen. Positive results from either measurement would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. This proposal is focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding the trapping of antihydrogen. These issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: how to confine positrons, antiprotons in an octupole at sufficiently cold temperatures; how do leptons interact with the background radiation field; how do antiproton-antiproton collisions relax nonthermal distributions; how to mix positrons and antiprotons so that the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap; how do zerofrequency bounce resonances cause antiproton loss when the confining potentials are changed, and; how to predict the energy and state of the resultant antihydrogen under various mixing schemes. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics.<br/><br/>The long-term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The proposed research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups in the physical sciences.<br/><br/>The undergraduate participation adds a broader educational impact through the early-year training of students by introducing them to scientific research as a possible career path."
0.099999,"ABSTRACT<br/>AST-0071108<br/>Halpern<br/><br/>This project has as its objective the rapid follow-up of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows using ground-based, optical/IR photometry and spectroscopy on the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) 2.4m telescope on Kitt Peak. The PI has been one of the important players in this type of research since 1998 and has the good, prompt access to the telescope which is necessary for this type of follow-up work.<br/><br/>Using the approximately 6 to 8 bursts per year in the northern hemisphere that are located within hours by the BeppoSAX and/or RXTE satellites, this project will continue a successful program of discovering and characterizing the optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts with the two telescopes of the MDM Observatory. Starting with the year 2000 launch of the HETE-II satellite, it will become possible to make optical identifications within minutes of a GRB event, which affords the opportunity to obtain multicolor optical light curves on small telescopes such as the MDM<br/>1.3m, and absorption-line redshifts on medium-sized telescopes such as the MDM 2.4m.<br/>These data can be used to study the temporal decay and spectral evolution of the afterglow in order to diagnose the energetics of the fireball, and to model the circumstellar environments<br/>in which these explosions occur, e.g., uniform interstellar medium vs. stellar wind. HETE-II will also be sensitive to the class of short-duration gamma-ray bursts, which have heretofore not been identified, and are distinct in their gamma-ray spectral properties and flux distribution from the long-duration bursts which have triggered all previous after- glow detections. This work has the goal of revealing a distinct population of GRB progenitor, for example, old ones that have traveled outside their galaxy's interstellar medium, versus those that end their short lives while still embedded in dense, star-forming regions. Infrared photometry is of utmost importance for this distinction. Prompt IR photometry, particularly in the K band, offers the opportunity to identify the<br/>highest redshift and/or most obscured GRBs. The MDM 2.4m and ONIS IR camera, can easily detect a moderately obscured GRB to z = 10 within an hour of the event. On longer time scales, the light curves can be followed for several days in order to discover the predicted (and occasionally detected) temporal steepening which is the signature of jet-like afterglows. Measuring such breaks is crucial to quantifying the effects of beaming on the energetics of the fireball and on the global statistics of GRBs and their afterglows. Finally, the afterglows of the brighter and closer events can be monitored for several weeks in order to search for the signatures of underlying supernovae in their late-time optical light curves. The possible association of at least some GRBs with supernovae of massive stars promises to be the long-sought handle on the physics of the GRB itself.

0.3591,"9624924 Rudolph The study of galactic structure and evolution is one of the most fundamental in Astronomy. The research to be carried will focus on studying the structure and evolution of our own Milky Way by comparing observations of two distinct parts of our Galaxy, the local solar neighborhood, and the outer Galaxy. The solar neighborhood is the best studied region of the Galaxy. The outer Galaxy is less well understood, but its proximity and differences in physical conditions (e.g., low gas density, low metallicity) make it an ideal place to study contrasts with the local neighborhood. The areas of study be: 1) searches for and studies of atomic hydrogen (HII) regions in the outer Galaxy; 2) a study of Galactic abundances and how they vary in the Galaxy; 3) studies of molecular cloud structure; and 4) studies of the stellar content of regions of active star-formation. A Very Large Array (VLA) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio continuum survey of HII regions in the outer Galaxy has begun, and this work will be continued by analyzing the data to determine HII region properties. These data can be compared with similar data taken in the inner Galaxy. The survey will be carried out to observe lower luminosity radio sources. A study of outer Galaxy abundances (N,O,S) in HII regions measured from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The Infrared Satellite Observatory (ISO) will be used to observe additional lines of Ar and Ne in some outer Galaxy HII regions, and to measure abundances in the furthest known HII region at a distance of 28 kpc from the center of the Galaxy. A third objective will involve new molecular-line observations of two star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy in order to determine the structure of the molecular clouds. In particular, it is planned to measure the spectrum of clump masses (initial clump function, or ICF) in t hese clouds in order to compare with the numerous measurements of the ICF parameter in local clouds. The final objective is to obtain JHK photometry of a number of nearby star-forming clouds using a near-IR camera mounted on the Claremont Colleges l-m telescope. With this telescope and camera, entire clouds could be mapped (such as rho-Oph), thereby obtaining a complete census of the embedded cluster. Models of the observed cluster luminosity function will allow us to determine the underlying IMF. Similar cluster membership data for the outer Galaxy will be obtained, allowing one to compare the IMF in two regions of very different metallicity. Also, comparison of the ICF and lMF in both the local neighborhood and in the outer Galaxy will help one understand how star-formation proceeds from molecular cloud clumps to stars of various masses. The educational component of this project will focus on course development and modernization. The Observational Astronomy course offered at Harvey Mudd College has, in the past, neglected including recent advances in non-optical astronomy. New lecture material and computer laboratories are being developed to introduce non-optical data into the course. The Advanced Astronomy course will be redesigned into a series of topical half-semester courses (e.g., Star-formation and the Interstellar Medium, Cosmology, Extragalactic Astronomy, Galactic Structure, etc.) to introduce modern astronomical topics into the curriculum and to increase student interest in advanced Astronomy. The educational component of this project will also continue K-12 outreach work begun in the last year, through a partnership with two local Claremont School District teachers."

0.014833,"AST-9808608 Best In simplest terms, one of the fundamental goals of cosmology is to describe the Universe as accurately as possible. In order to do this, the multiple aspects of the Universe, both past and present-day, must be completely modeled. Some of these characteristics include the age, density, temperature, and extent of the Universe and its components. The research to be carried out will explore the clustering of objects in the Universe. The modern motivation for fractal geometry may best be summed up by this quote of Benoit Mandelbrot: ""Mountains are not cones, clouds are not spheres, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line."" Fractals are, in simplest terms, ""objects which are (approximately) self-similar on all scales"". The renewed modern interest in fractals has led to applying it to the study of large-scale structure in the Universe, giving a quantitative descriptive scheme to ideas that had been expressed qualitatively as early as C. V. L. Charlier's map of extragalactic nebulae in the 1920s. The Las Campanas Redshift Survey, of about 26000 galaxies, has positional and redshift information on the galaxies and these data will be studied using the pointwise dimension, or PD method. The PD method is an easy-to-use fractal statistic which has numerous advantages over the more traditional methods used to study the clustering of galaxies. It is hoped that much information can be gleaned about the environments of the galaxies in the Las Campanas catalog and these results may be used for comparison of results of studies of future catalogs. ***"

Yau conjectured that the existence of <br/>Kaehler metrics with constant scalar curvature is related to the stability of <br/>the underlying polarized manifold. In recent years, striking progress has <br/>been made in this direction. In 1997, G. Tian proved that any <br/>Kaehler-Einstein manifold with positive scalar curvature is K-Stable. In<br/>2001, S. K. Donaldson proved that an algebraic manifold with discrete <br/>automorphism group and Kaehler metric of constant scalar curvature is Chow stable.<br/>Very recently, in a joint work with G. Tian, the proposer proved that <br/>the existence of Kaehler metrics of constant scalar curvature implies Semi-K<br/>Stability of the K energy with respect to the given cohomology class. <br/>Inspired by these results, the proposer wants to study a network of problems <br/>centered around the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics (which includes <br/>constant scalar curvature metric as a special case), stability of polarized Kaehler <br/>manifold, and other related problems. The main ideas of solving these problems<br/>consist of improving regularity for geodesics in the space of Kaehler metrics in <br/>the sense of T. Mabuchi, of understanding the long-time existence of the Calabiflow, <br/>and of the convergence of the Kaehler-Ricci flow. These ideas are related to different <br/>mathematical fields but the proposer believes that they are all very promising to solve the Conjecture of Yau (in particular to solve the problem of the existence of Kaehler-Einstein <br/>metrics on Fano manifold). The proposer is going to work on the problems through <br/>these ideas.<br/><br/>The problem of the existence of Kaehler metrics of constant<br/>scalar curvature, being the key problem in differential geometry, has <br/>strong impact to other fields of sciences like physics. According to Albert<br/>Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of <br/>space-time. Thus the research in differential geometry is crucially important in <br/>physics and cosmology. The research proposed also has impact in string theory, <br/>which is the theory of unifying all four basic forces of the Nature.

For example, in cosmology singularities of<br/>space-time (e.g. ``black holes'') play a fundamental role, and the<br/>understanding of singularity formation in geometric flow problems is a<br/>key ingredient in the approach of Hamilton, Perelman and others to<br/>Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture. Likewise in the study of the<br/>``canonical'' objects which arise naturally in topology and geometry,<br/>singularities arise in a very natural and unavoidable manner, and the<br/>understanding of these singularities is an absolutely fundamental<br/>problem. As with most non-linear phenomena, there is not a single<br/>general theory which applies in a wide range of different contexts.<br/>Rather, each different context has its own collection of effective<br/>techniques, and it is the development and application of such<br/>techniques in the context of the geometric calculus of variations<br/>which is the focus of the present research proposal. Specifically,<br/>Simon and White propose to continue their efforts toward a more<br/>complete understanding of singularities, and how they are formed, in<br/>the context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy minimizing<br/>maps, and in the context of various geometric flow problems."

1.58007,"The proposed research at Stanford University aims to provide new understanding of the underlying causes for a fundamental property of nature known as neutrino oscillations. One of the unexpected results in particle physics during the last decade has been the discovery that neutrinos have mass, that they have the ability to change from one species to another as they travel through space or matter, and that the extent of these transformations (mixing angles) is surprisingly large. Neutrinos are fundamental constituents of our universe and, together with photons are the most numerous. Yet, neutrinos are poorly understood compared to other fundamental constituents and further studies are required to understand many significant issues in cosmology and astrophysics, to probe physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and to resolve the mystery of matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe. The proposed program consists of the MINOS experiment and planning for an off-axis neutrino experiment with the neutrino beam currently being completed at Fermilab. The MINOS experiment is in its final stages of construction. The far detector of MINOS, located in the Soudan Mine in northern Minnesota was completed in August 2003 and has begun taking data on cosmic rays. The neutrino beam and other related construction efforts at Fermilab are expected to be complete by the end of 2004 and data taking with accelerator neutrinos should commence shortly thereafter. The MINOS experiment will significantly improve our knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters in the atmospheric neutrino energy region; will search for subdominant oscillation modes into electron and/or sterile neutrinos; and will observe oscillatory behavior of muon neutrino disappearance, thus providing a conclusive test of the oscillation origin of that phenomenon. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the research will occur at several levels: (a) Understanding how matter is constructed and how the forces of nature shape it into the myriad observed forms is a long standing question that resonates with scientists and non-scientists alike; (b) The research program poses a set of questions through which students and postdoctoral fellows will learn not only to frame crisp tests of the fundamental construction of matter, but also to devise innovative methods and tools for conducting them. Attacking such problems provides the rigorously educated young people that our society desperately needs; and (c) the proposal includes elements of outreach to the broader community."

This famous conjecture was proved by Yau in 1976 when C_1 =0, and independently by Yau and Aubin for the case<br/>C_1 < 0. In Fano surface, the corresponding Calabi conjecture is solved by G. Tian in 1989. The high dimensional case is largely open till this day. This is an exciting area of mathematics in which we will see more important breakthroughs in the near future with impact both on the rest of mathematics and on physics. For instance, the work of Calabi-Yau directly provided mathematical foundation to mirror symmetry in the so called Calabi-Yau manifold. <br/>Therefore, we propose to study a network of problems centered around the existence of extremal Kahler metric, stability of the underlying polarized Kahler manifold, and other related areas. Extremal Kahler metrics is natural extension to the renown Calabi-Yau metrics.<br/><br/>The principal investigator has been involved in the education and supervision of many graduate students at the University of Wisconsin and elsewhere. The proposer actively promotes the interaction of mathematicians from USA, Europe and Asian (particularly China, Japan and S.Korea). He has organized several international conferences in China where mathematicians from different background are invited. So this proposal will enhance our ability to train next generation of US based mathematicians.<br/><br/>More broadly, The set of problems we propose here is key problems in differential geometry, which has strong impact to other fields of sciences like physics. According to Albert Einstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of space-time. Thus the research in differential geometry is crucially important in physics and cosmology.

0.095,"Recent historical approaches to science in the late seventeenth century are beginning to reveal how nature and morals continued to be linked during the scientific revolution, with important effects on scientific theory.

The method involves study of archives and rare book collections in France, Holland, England and Sweden, to examine the life and work of scientists associated with the Parisian Royal Academy of Sciences during the reign of Louis XIV. By studying both public and private documents and records, the investigation can identify opposition and its motives, in relationship to views of cosmology, the theory of the soul and public issues of conscience. The findings will clarify what moral lessons scientists inferred from nature; issues of conscience that troubled them; how they handled disagreements with patrons; the extent to which opposition could endanger a scientific career or scientific achievements prevent punishment; to what degree scientific matters sparked issues of conscience or abetted the fight for moral principle; and whether the necessity of opposition affected either the scientific or the moral principles that guided scientists' lives. These results will be published in articles and a book."

The dimension of this system of ordinary differential equations is of the order of tens of thousands. To solve such a system requires an enormous amount of computer time. This project aims to develop cost effective and globally stable algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations, with an emphasis on schemes suitable for large systems. The project concentrates on the development of integration methods that would facilitate: taking much larger step sizes without sacrificing accuracy, extension of the multiple-time stepping strategy to higher-order integrators and the application of Psi Calculus for partitioning, scheduling and routing the arrays to the multiprocessors to cut down the computation time by a significant proportion. ***"

2.422972,"This project develops an instrument, called ConFlux, hosted at the University of Michigan (UM), specifically designed to enable High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters to communicate seamlessly and at interactive speeds with data-intensive operations. The project establishes a hardware and software ecosystem to enable large scale data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems. ConFlux will produce advances in predictive modeling in several disciplines including turbulent flows, materials physics, cosmology, climate science and cardiovascular flow modeling. <br/><br/>A wide range of phenomena exhibit emergent behavior that makes modeling very challenging. In this project, physics-constrained data-driven modeling approaches are pursued to account for the underlying complexity. These techniques require HPC applications (running on external clusters) to interact with large data sets at run time. ConFlux provides low latency communications for in- and out-of-core data, cross-platform storage, as well as high throughput interconnects and massive memory allocations. The file-system and scheduler natively handle extreme-scale machine learning and traditional HPC modules in a tightly integrated workflow---rather than in segregated operations--leading to significantly lower latencies, fewer algorithmic barriers and less data movement. <br/><br/>Course material developed from the usage of ConFlux is being integrated into the educational curriculum via several degree and certificate programs offered by two UM institutes dedicated to computational and data sciences. Use of the ConFlux cluster will be extended to research groups outside of UM utilizing a number of Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) bridging tools and file-systems. Connections established through UM's Office of Outreach and Diversity are being leveraged to extend the use of ConFlux to minority serving institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

This award ensures that HSU undergraduates, many of whom are first-generation college students and members of underrepresented groups in STEM fields, gain valuable research skills necessary for the pursuit of graduate studies or careers in industry. Undergraduates will also be sent to perform research at the University of Washington through a collaboration formed with a gravity research group there. This collaboration gives the students experience working in a world-class research environment. Alumni of the laboratory have secured prestigious graduate fellowships and industrial positions. This award greatly contributes to the expansion of research at HSU in the STEM fields. Within the major program, software and hardware developed for this project will be transferable to educational opportunities in the upper division classroom. This award also allows undergraduates to participate in valuable dissemination efforts through presentations at national and regional conferences, as well as publication of research results. Finally, tests of gravity are of great interest to research in diverse fields ranging from astrophysics and cosmology to particle physics and precision measurement science.<br/><br/> This award supports high-precision experiments that will test the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) of General Relativity and the gravitational Inverse-Square Law (ISL) at unprecedented levels. The WEP will be tested at the millimeter scale and the ISL will be probed over sub-millimeter distances with unmatched sensitivity down to approximately 25 microns. Both tests use a novel parallel-plate torsion pendulum and attractor mass design. In recent years the study of the gravitational interaction at short (sub-millimeter) distance scales has gained much attention due in a large part to unification scenarios arising in string or M theory that require more than three spatial dimensions, some of which could be macroscopic. Short-range tests of gravity and the WEP also investigate possible proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, generally attributed to Dark Energy. Finally, such tests present the possibility to search for hypothetical new interactions due to exotic particles or other phenomena. Many scenarios concerning these effects predict a violation of the WEP or ISL at short distances. Since 1999, experimental limits have improved dramatically so that the ISL has proven valid over distances down to approximately 55 microns. A dedicated test of the WEP, however, has not been performed below the millimeter scale. The work described in this proposal will probe the WEP for test mass separations at the sub-millimeter scale. This measurement will be accomplished with a parallel-plate torsion pendulum design that will provide an essentially null experiment and use multiple composition dipole combinations. Similarly, an unparalleled test of the gravitational ISL will be pursued by decreasing the pendulum/attractor test mass separation to 100 microns."
0.154748,"Part 1<br/><br/>One of the fundamental predictions of the cold dark matter cosmology is that galaxies grow through a series of major and minor mergers with other galaxies. By studying galaxy mergers through detailed observations and theoretical models, we can understand galaxy changes over time in general. Significant progress has been made in the past two decades, but the problem is far from solved. The key physical processes of galaxy merging remain poorly understood. In particular, simulations make predictions that until now have been difficult to identify because of observational challenges, hindering direct comparison between observation and simulation. This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of galaxy changes caused by mergers by eliminating the observational obstacles and characterizing the frequency of binary black holes at small physical scales.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>This proposal will identify, confirm, and characterize a sample of kiloparsec-scale binary Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For the first time, the binaries will be identified systematically using high-resolution deep radio and optical surveys in a 275 square degree field. This search will increase the current sample of kiloparsec-scale binary AGNs by an order-of-magnitude. Unbiased by dust-obscuration, the sample will cover a range of host galaxy properties and black-hole-accretion modes. By comparing the uniformly selected binary AGNs with matched control samples, the team will investigate a number of outstanding questions in the merger paradigm of galaxy formation and change: Can mergers trigger and synchronize black hole accretion? What is the origin of the two-accretion/feedback modes (radiative-mode vs. jet-mode)? Can AGN feedback significantly affect the star formation activity on a short timescale (~1,000,000 years)? How frequently does a supermassive black hole oscillate around a stellar core because of gravitational wave recoil or a delay in binary formation? As the immediate precursor of massive black hole binaries, studies of kiloparsec-scale galaxy mergers will also have important implications for low-frequency gravitational wave experiments."
0.099784,"Search for macroscopic forces outside predictions from the Standard Model of cosmology have received particular attention by experimentalists in the last few decades. Understanding the fundamental forces of nature has always been an important part of physics. While the first such force studied was the gravitational force and our understanding of this interaction is extremely precise for relatively large separations among the interacting bodies, its validity at short distances has only recently been tested. Furthermore, the possibility of undetected light bosons, elementary particles governing the interaction between spin polarized bodies, is very poorly constrained. The groups plans to undertake an effort to gain a better understanding of these issues. By combining sample development and very precise measurements of the interactions between a source and a test mass, a much better knowledge of the interaction strength and mass of potential light bosons will be gained. The PI and co-PI will continue to attract undergraduate and high school students in physics and engineering to participate in the proposed work. Graduate students involved in the project will also have supervisory duties over undergraduate students, improving their leadership skills.

In particular the PI will use his position as co-advisor of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)-IUPUI chapter to interest the Hispanic and Native American community in Science careers. Graduate students will be trained in two sub-disciplines in physics, precision measurements and magnetism. Demonstrations associated with the principles of forces, their actions at a distance and the decrease of their strength as the distance increases will be presented at community gathering events (School of Science Freshmen Picnic Day, Open Houses) and recruiting events and in the classroom environment.<br/><br/>Specifically, this proposal will: i) extend existing constraints for unpolarized masses at submicron range. This will be achieved mainly through a minor modification of the system previously used, ii) develop spin-polarized masses with no net magnetization. This development will be accomplished by the deposition of thin films in the required geometry, (iii) use the grown spin-polarized, zero magnetization films to constrain the existence of monopole-dipole interactions at short ranges, and (iv) study the systematic effect of the residual electrostatic forces present in the experiment. The ubiquitous problem encountered in the measurement of small forces at short separations arising from the effect of random electric potential on the surfaces of the test and source bodies will continue to be investigated."

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. LZ is a ~7-tonne liquid xenon (LXe) dark matter detector to be installed at the 4850-foot level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, to look for dark matter. This work will contribute to the design of that detector. Development of technology related to LXe will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble liquids as detection materials. These projects will also result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. LXe has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging.<br/><br/>This detector will use established liquid xenon time projection chamber technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-D position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid xenon, removal of surface artifacts, and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The design also features a gadolinium-loaded liquid scintillator veto that will hermetically enclose the central xenon detector and provide powerful tagging of background neutrons and gammas. The LZ experiment will have world-leading sensitivity to WIMP dark matter with a sensitivity about 400 times better than current results and covering a substantial range of theoretically motivated candidates.

0.438,"****Technical Abstract****<br/>This CAREER grant supported by the Division Materials Research aims to have a crystal growth of new and perfect topological insulators/superconductors and exploration of Dirac surface state of the perfectly grown topological insulators (TIs). It also aims to integrate research in experimental condensed matter physics and development of a unique physics educational program at Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T). New methods will be used to grow perfect bulk insulating TIs and to fabricate large surface-to-volume ratio of TI nanowire arrays. These perfect topological materials are necessary for Dirac surface current detection which is important for both new physics exploration such as studies of Majorana fermion and axion electrodynamics, and technological applications such as spintronic and quantum computing devices. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, Aharonov-Bohm effect and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak interference on the perfectly grown TIs will be performed to estimate surface Dirac electron effective mass and decay length. Surface resistivity measurements under magnetic fields up to 45 T will then be carried out for the investigation of fractional quantum Hall effect which is a big quest in the field concerning the role of interactions and strong correlations in topological states of matter. <br/><br/>****Non-Technical Abstract****<br/>Topological insulator (TI) is a new quantum material which has insulating property in its bulk but has high conductivity of electrons on its surface. This surface conducting state is predicted to be a solution for future computing technology. However, surface transport measurements are challenging due to the imperfections of the current existing TIs. A new synthesis technique that utilizes a reduced confining reaction space will be applied to grow perfect bulk insulating crystals in order to permit surface current detection. This electronic transport detection of the surface electrons or the surface Dirac state is necessary for heat dissipation-less spintronic devices where electron spin manipulation can be performed by interfacing a perfect TI and a superconductor for potential fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. Besides, TIs can act as a bridge to bring together high energy and condensed matter physicists to search for long-sought particle such as the Majorana fermion i.e. a fermion which is its own anti-particle and an intermediate particle for electric and magnetic field interactions called the axion which could provide a clue to the mystery of dark matter in cosmology. This CAREER grant also helps to integrate the material synthesis in solid state physics course taught in S&T and to present physics shows targeted to local K-12 students."

Such quarks and gluons are deeply confined in normal matter. However when normal matter is heated to a high enough temperature, it changes into a new deconfined form of QCD matter directly made of the quarks and gluons. Such a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) briefly occupied the Universe at about a few microseconds after the ""Big Bang"", and has now been (re-)created as the hottest matter ever in laboratory by heavy ion collisions (""Little Bang""). Its properties are measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the quark-gluon matter created in heavy ion collisions is strongly-interacting both prior to and after reaching thermal equilibrium. Exactly how such strongly interacting nature arises in the many-body setting from the fundamental QCD theory, is a challenging problem that lacks a deep understanding. This project will investigate this missing link and seek to develop effective descriptions of the matter both in and out of equilibrium. The results will advance our understanding of QCD confinement, provide fresh insights into jet quenching mechanism, make significant progress in search of QCD topological effects, and reduce existing uncertainties on the pre-thermal stage. The expected outcome will contribute to our understanding of fundamental questions such as ""how the color confinement phenomenon arises"", and ""how the experimentally observed properties of the quark-gluon matter in and out of equilibrium emerge from QCD"".<br/><br/>The study supported by this award concerns the exploration of new forms of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These activities embody important interdisciplinary aspects, as they are expected to have a profound impact on other areas of physics, ranging from cosmology, supernova, compact stars, to supersymmetric theories, string theories as well as condensed matter physics. This project integrates research with education through mentoring of graduate, as well as undergraduate students. This project will actively pursue a five-year educational outreach plan to develop educational software for computer desktops and mobile devices that utilizes visualization and simulations to demonstrate concepts related to the ""Physics of Extreme Matter"" in an interactive, engaging, and children-friendly manner."
0.375,"Whereas traditional high-performance computing (HPC) applications are computationally intensive, recent HPC applications require more data-intensive analysis and visualization to extract knowledge. In many cases, these applications execute the same computational algorithm as in the past (e.g., parallel search or parallel rendering) but now must do so for significantly larger data sets. For example, the life sciences, along with the cross-cutting area of scientific visualization, constitute an emerging category of HPC applications that not only perform sophisticated calculations but also ingest a sea of data. Running these new HPC data-parallel applications on today's computing platforms imposes new challenges and demands additional functionality.<br/><br/>However, today's HPC platforms still adopt a compute-centric model and do not handle these new challenges well. Such a model often moves a large amount of data to various parallel computational processes. Consequently, long CPU wait times for I/O to complete and enormous data-movement overhead become major stumbling blocks to high performance and scalability. This project encompasses the creation of a scalable cross-layer software framework to enable both computationally intensive and data-intensive parallel HPC applications to run on distributed file systems. This framework consists of two interwoven research tasks: (1) an adaptive, data locality-aware, middleware system that dynamically schedules compute processes to access local data by monitoring physical data locations and (2) a framework that captures the computation and data I/O processing relationship from parallel applications and coordinates the scheduling of the corresponding process and I/O execution for maximum parallel efficiency. The success of this project contributes enhanced productivity and return on investment on HPC resources via the elimination of both CPU wait time and network transfer of frequently accessed data in scientific applications. An open-source, sustainable, and reusable software framework is delivered to speed-up the discovery and innovation process in areas such as bioinformatics, climate, high-energy physics, cosmology, astrophysics, and chromodynamics. The synergy in the two proposing institutions, Virginia Tech and the University of Central Florida, and their collaborating DOE national laboratories, will catalyze new and beneficial perspectives in the graduate education of students and prepare a 21st-century workforce in HPC."

0.089,"Christine Corbett Moran is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the California Institute of Technology. Upcoming space missions will enable astronomers to observationally test theoretical models for supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth for the first time. How SMBHs formed so quickly, during the first billion years of the Universe, remains a central puzzle of cosmology and galaxy evolution. One candidate formation pathway is through supermassive stars (SMSs) that could have formed in the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds. At the end of their lifetimes, the collapse of SMSs may result in black holes with seed masses large enough to be the progenitors of SMBHs; powerful thermonuclear explosions with no remnants; or black hole-explosion combinations. Yet our understanding of SMS collapse, its set of outcomes, and their signatures is in its infancy. Moran's research program will comprehensively address SMS evolution, producing predictions that can be tested by upcoming missions to help untangle the formation channel of SMBHs. Moran's program also includes a significant educational component, which will give a computing school, the Summer Space Programming Challenge to Pasadena area high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>Much theoretical work is still needed to understand SMS collapse/explosion dynamics and to predict their observational multimessenger (electromagnetic, gravitational wave, neutrino, nucleosynthetic) signatures in preparation and support of upcoming space missions such as the NASA James Webb Space Telescope, the NASA Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, and the ESA Euclid mission. SMS collapse is a promising pathway to SMBH formation, yet its simulation with the necessary microphysics (stellar equation of state, nuclear reactions) and approximate or full general relativity has thus far been limited to spherical or axial symmetry, completely ignoring magnetic fields and 3D dynamics. Lightcurve and spectral modeling has only been performed for a single SMS explosion model. Moran's research program will comprehensively address SMS evolution through collapse and potential explosion in 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with detailed microphysics, producing observables across the SMS parameter space spanned by mass, metallicity, rotation, and magnetization. Necessary code development in support of the program will be released as open source. The broader impact of the program includes the Summer Space Programming Challenge, in which students and teachers will gain further interest in space research, concrete computational skills, a project portfolio, and open source curriculum materials."
0.51834,"One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be, and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This project will focus on the development of a detector based on liquid argon to search for the so-called sterile neutrino, whose existence is suggested by BSM theories.<br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which refines LArTPC technology, using the Liquid Argon Near Detector (Lar1ND) and the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL. Both of these experiments will further the study of potential signals of sterile neutrinos. Sterile neutrinos are proposed BSM particles that could explain aspects of cosmology and astrophysics such as Dark Matter. MicroBooNE will make a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with the superior LArTPC, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. The PI's Group has broader impacts programs that address development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved<br/>undergraduate education;and increased public scientific literacy."
0.816,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of large backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. However, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the galaxy, yielding a day-night modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. Of current searches with directional detectors, the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment is a leader, having a decade of experience. The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFT's unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. <br/><br/>These advances in background rejection, combined with the fact that further limit setting capabilities are hampered by the small volume of DRIFT-II, suggest that DRIFT should scale-up. This award will enable the collaboration to continue running DRIFT-II in the Boulby mine in England. In addition to running DRIFT-IId, these funds will provide hardware for a second detector, DRIFT-IIe.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of hardware and software experience. Finally, the DRIFT detector technology has promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments."

Increasing, the performance of these electroceramics is limited by the characteristics of their surface. This project aims to identify the relationship between the surface atomic structure and the processes involved in the electrochemistry. Advancements in this area support a more energy sufficient economy. An integrated educational plan provides research opportunities to underrepresented high school and undergraduate students, as well as community outreach to Grade 7-12 students that builds on the Magic School Bus concept.

Ultra-thin overlayers deposited via physical-vapor deposition further enable precise compositional and structure control. The crystallographic and electronic structure of these atomically-controlled surfaces are characterized using synchrotron surface X-ray diffraction and surface-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy under a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Community outreach/education - A Journey to the Inside of Materials - emphasizing the magnificence and functionality of ceramic material involves curating three-dimensional slideshows featuring images of everyday objects at the nanoscale, and projecting them via the unique visualization facility at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory."
0.709342,"Acceleration of computing power of supercomputers along with development and deployment of large instruments such as telescopes, colliders, sensors and devices raises one fundamental question. ""Can the time to insight and knowledge discovery be reduced at the same exponential rate?"" The answer currently is clearly ""NO"", because a critical step that combines analytics, mining and discovering knowledge from the massive datasets has lagged far behind advances in software, simulation and generation of data. Analysis of data requires ""data-driven"" computing and analytics. This entails scalable software for data reduction, approximations, analysis, statistics, and bottom-up discovery. Scalable and parallel analytics software for processing large amount of data is required in order to make a significant leap forward in scientific discoveries. <br/>This project develops innovative, scalable, and sustainable data analytics algorithms to enable analysis and mining of massive data on high-performance parallel computers, which include (1) bottom-up and unsupervised data clustering algorithms that are suitable for spatio-temporal data, massive graph analytics, community computations, and detection of patterns in time-varying graphs, different types of data, and different data characteristics; (2) change detection and anomaly detection in spatio-temporal data; and (3) tracking moving data and cluster dynamics within certain time and space constraints. These parallel algorithms use the massive amount of data generated from scientific applications, such as astrophysics, cosmology simulations, climate modeling, and social networking analysis, for result verification and performance evaluation on modern high-performance parallel computers.<br/>This project directly addresses the critical needs for spatio-temporal data analysis, performance scalability, and programming productivity of large-scale scientific discovery via parallel analytics software for big data. This work will impact applications of enormous societal benefits and scientific importance such as climate understanding, environmental sustainability, astrophysics, biology and medicine by accelerating scientific discoveries.

0.1336,"Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary ""dark matter"" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Remarkably, particle physics theories proposed for other reasons predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.<br/><br/>The project will help train undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in a multidisciplinary field using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies with applications in areas of great societal interest. Furthermore, the project will support the preparation of Native American students for post-secondary education in science and engineering, with the goal of improving the diversity of the nation's scientific workforce through the group's participation in the GEAR-UP program at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from backgrounds. The high background rejection that the SuperCDMS technology offers provides significant advantages compared to other technologies, yielding world-leading sensitivity to low-mass dark matter and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. To achieve the full sensitivity, it will be critical to reduce the radon-induced backgrounds of the experiment.

0.013054,"A Globular Cluster is a tight group of hundreds of thousands of stars bound together by gravity. There are hundreds of Globular Clusters orbiting around our own Milky Way galaxy. Globular Clusters serve as fossils that trace conditions in the universe at the earliest times, when galaxies were just starting to form. Intriguing differences are observed between individual Globular Clusters, which provide clues about the formation of our Galaxy. In Globular Cluster stars, the concentrations of atoms belonging to different chemical elements vary in ways that challenge conventional wisdom about the ages, origins and life cycles of stars. The investigators will make observations with some of the world?s largest and best-equipped telescopes to test theoretical models of how stars, star clusters and galaxies come to be.<br/><br/>The principal work involves (a) developing a unified scenario for self-enrichment among star clusters; (b) understanding the stellar content of Globular Clusters through novel dynamical and stellar population investigations; and (c) studying the relationship between Globular Clusters and galaxies at the extreme upper limit of the Globular Cluster mass function. New optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations will be made to explore how measurable quantities (such as mass-to-light ratios and abundance anomalies) depend on age, metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and dynamical evolution. Intriguing trends, many of which confound standard interpretations, have already been identified: 1) self-enrichment appears to be implicated in abundance spreads in Galactic Globular Clusters and in a mass-metallicity relation found in extragalactic Globular Cluster systems; 2) observed properties of galaxy stellar halos, and initial measurements of gas in intermediate-age clusters, each challenge the favored mechanism for self-enrichment; 3) the dependence of mass-to-light ratio on metallicity is opposite to that expected from stellar evolution models; 4) an expanding zoo of compact stellar systems has been identified, including ultra compact dwarfs, that could be formed either by tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies or from Globular Cluster mergers; 5) the elevated mass-to-light ratios of ultra compact dwarfs may be explained by massive central black holes. The investigators will clarify each of these issues, test stellar evolution and population synthesis models, and trace the origins of compact stellar systems.<br/><br/>Since Globular Clusters are more complex than formerly realized, understanding their properties and how they relate to other types of stellar systems has wide implications in astrophysics; inferences drawn from Globular Clusters inform theories of the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies, black holes, and dark matter.

1.79,"The nature of ""dark matter"" and the formation and evolution of galaxies, have emerged as key questions of contemporary cosmology. Redshift surveys of nearby galaxies reveal clouds of galaxies and voids on scales much larger than previously suspected, but cannot by themselves address how such structure arose. It has gradually become clear that galaxies have indeed evolved measurably within the last 3-7 billion years, but by how much and by what mechanisms is not known. Overlying all these concerns is uncertainty about the amount and nature of dark matter and how it impacts the development of galaxies and the growth of large-scale structure. Substantial gains have been made, but progress is discouragingly slow owing to the enormous observational difficulties attendant in studying the faintest galaxies. The advent of a new class of large ground-based telescopes - of which Keck is the first - will increase progress dramatically, and time is now ripe for a major new assault on these puzzles. The main need is first to clarify how much and what kind of evolution has occurred in galaxies over the last half of the lifetime of the Universe. The DEEP program (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe) will tackle these problems. Through DEEP, an understanding is sought of how their distribution in space has evolved over the last several billion years. The answers will certainly constrain the nature of the dark matter and, may allow us even to address the ultimate goal - the geometry of space itself. The heart of DEEP is a redshift survey of ~15,000 galaxies. A novel aspect of DEEP is the measurement of internal motions in galaxies, since these provide estimates of their mass. Evolution is thus revealed by comparing the properties of distant galaxies with their nearby, similar-mass counterparts. Very large samples are required to study separately the evolution among the known wide variety of galaxies. Clustering and the geometry of space are also problems that require large samples to be studied for confidence in the results. The overriding problem for such a program is the great amount of telescope time required to obtain high-quality spectra for exquisitely faint, distant galaxies. Heroic efforts with current spectrographs on 3-4 m class telescopes have resulted in just a few dozen redshifts at the very faint 24 magnitude limit of DEEP. The Keck Telescope with its first-generation spectrograph LRIS (Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph) will be able to obtain such redshifts substantially faster - it may be practical to acquire some 600-700 galaxies per year with a large investment of time - but even so, 20-25 years would be required to obtain a sample of 15,000 galaxies. This is not practical. A new spectrograph for the Keck Telescope will provide dramatic gains in speed - 5 times over LRIS and 80 times or more over any current system. This spectrograph, the Multi-Barrel Survey Spectrograph (MBSS), utilizes a state-of-the-art wide-field camera that has already been incorporated into LRIS. Using a novel feature of the LRIS optics - an off-axis slit and matching collimator - the LRIS optical system will be replicated four times in a compact design with high efficiency to create an instrument ideally suited to the study of faint galaxies. The same spectrograph will also service a wide variety of the faintest survey programs besides DEEP. The issues that DEEP addresses - galaxies, large-scale structure, dark matter, and the evolution of the universe - are ones that strongly stimulate the public imagination. Since DEEP is being carried out in partnership with the Berkeley Center for Particle Astrophysics, the project is ideally placed to utilize its educational programs to reach out to a wide audience."
0.129259,"The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the leading unsolved problems in cosmology today, and absent any direct detection of the particles themselves, the structure of nearby dwarf galaxies remains one of the most promising avenues for learning about the temperature and self-interaction properties of DM because any deviations from the standard cold dark matter model should happen at low masses.<br/><br/>Modern ideas regarding how galaxies form in the Universe involve some form of ""hierarchical"" process by which small systems progressively merged into ever larger systems like our Milky Way Galaxy. A key element of this paradigm regards how mergers proceed, which, in turn, relies on understanding the nature of the DM needed to drive the formation of galaxies within the observed lifetime of the Universe. Dwarf galaxies are the smallest, simplest entities with DM that also contain visible baryonic material in the form of stars and/or gas. As such, they---and particularly their dark halos---represent our best local analogs of the building blocks that initiated the hierarchical process. The broad goal of this project is to use empirical techniques---primarily kinematic observations of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies---to determine key properties of DM halos in these systems in a largely model-independent way.<br/><br/>The specific aims of this project include (1) learning how DM is distributed within individual galaxies by measuring the central mass densities and core properties of DM halos, (2) exploring how the evolution of the baryonic matter may have altered the DM components in galaxies, (3) determining if DM halos are truly scale free, (4) mapping the extents of DM halos in dwarfs and understanding how their dark and visible components have merged into the greater halo of our Galaxy, and (5) laying the groundwork to reconstruct the properties of the primordial population of dwarfs that contributed to the assembly of our Galaxy. This project builds on decades of NSF-sponsored instrument building and research grants to aid our understanding of the nature of DM.<br/><br/>The investigators will engage in educational activities with several K-12 teachers, give public talks, and participate in events such as ""Ask an Astronomer.""

This involves a number of interesting conceptual questions for which the principal investigator already has preliminary answers.

0.32,"A large body of evidence now indicates that about 80% of the matter in the universe is of a new type, known as dark matter. A variety of experimental and observational techniques from high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology have been brought to bear on the study of this new type of matter. But in order to correctly interpret the data from these many different experiments, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework for understanding dark matter.

The Broader Impact of this proposal will be the communication of these and other exciting developments at the frontier of fundamental physics to the broader Hawaii community, particularly at the high school level. The PI's efforts will be focused on participation in the QuarkNet program."
0.189279,"Many of our most celebrated physical theories are based on wave-like partial differential equations (PDEs). Important examples include the Einstein equations of general relativity (which form the basis of modern cosmology), the Euler equations of fluid mechanics, the equations of elasticity, and the equations of crystal optics. Despite hundreds of years of mathematical progress, major gaps remain in our understanding of solutions. For example, although it is expected that solutions often ""become infinite"" there are few cases in which mathematicians have found a proof. Moreover, in other contexts, it is not even known if the equations have solutions. Thus, we still do not have a definitive understanding of the physical predictions of many equations of classical physics. The main obstacle is that the aforementioned equations are extremely difficult to study except under unrealistic simplifying assumptions. However, there have been some recent advancements in resolving some of these difficulties. For example, recent results provide a detailed description of Big Bang formation in solutions to the Einstein equations and shocks in solutions to the Euler and related equations. A major goal of this project is to extend these results to apply to other physically relevant equations and regimes. This work will provide new insight on the long-time behavior of waves and on the ways in which various physical theories can break down. <br/><br/>This research project involves the rigorous study of quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs and has three main research goals. The first is to provide a detailed description of singularity formation in various quasilinear wave-like equations of physical significance, with an emphasis on avoiding symmetry assumptions whenever possible. Examples include various Einstein-matter equations, the Euler equations, and the equations of elasticity. This research will expand our understanding of singularity formation by enlarging the class of equations and the class of initial conditions that are known to lead to blow-up. The second research goal is to prove local well-posedness for a class of physically relevant quasilinear hyperbolic problems with a free boundary along which the hyperbolicity of the equations degenerates. The third is to develop new tools for understanding the behavior of solutions to quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs with multiple characteristics in contexts where knowledge of the precise characteristics is essential. An ultimate goal is to use these tools to prove that for such equations, under suitable assumptions on the nonlinearities and data, shock formation occurs and is stable. This proposal has several educational components that are intimately connected to the research problems. Many of the problems have components that can be investigated by advanced undergraduates, and the PI plans to supervise undergraduate research projects. There are also components suitable for PhD students. Moreover, the PI is organizing, with three co-organizers, a pair of summer schools targeted at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students from across the US and beyond. The PI will also develop curriculum materials that will be made freely available to the public online."
0.155746,"This award supports research in the Humboldt State University Gravitational Physics Laboratory (HSU GPL). Precision experiments will test the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) of General Relativity and the gravitational Inverse-Square Law (ISL) at unprecedented levels. The WEP will be tested at the millimeter scale and the ISL will be probed over sub-millimeter distances with unmatched sensitivity down to approximately 25 microns. In recent years the study of the gravitational interaction at short (sub-millimeter) distance scales has gained much attention due in a large part to unification scenarios arising in string or M-theory that require more than three spatial dimensions, some of which could be macroscopic. Short-range tests of gravity and the WEP also investigate possible proposed mechanisms that endeavor to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, generally attributed to Dark Energy. Finally, such tests present the possibility to search for hypothetical new interactions due to exotic particles or other phenomena. Many scenarios concerning these effects predict a violation of the WEP or ISL at short distances. Since 1999, experimental limits have improved dramatically so that the ISL has proven valid over distances down to approximately 55 microns. A dedicated test of the WEP, however, has not been performed below the millimeter scale. The initial work described in this proposal will probe the WEP at the millimeter scale and below. This measurement will be accomplished with a parallel-plate torsion pendulum design that will provide an essentially null experiment and use multiple composition dipole combinations. Subsequently, a more difficult test of the gravitational ISL will be pursued by decreasing the pendulum/attractor mass separation to 100 microns.<br/><br/> Humboldt State University is in a predominantly rural area of Northern California and the GPL is the only dedicated physics research laboratory in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. This award ensures that our undergraduates gain valuable research skills necessary for continuation of studies or pursuit of a career in industry. Undergraduates will also be sent to perform research at the University of Washington through a collaboration formed with a gravity research group there. Alumni of the laboratory have secured graduate fellowships and industrial positions. This award greatly contributes to the valuable expansion of research at HSU in the STEM fields.<br/>Within the major program, software developed for data acquisition and analysis will be transferable to educational opportunities in the upper division classroom. This award also allows undergraduates to participate in valuable dissemination efforts through presentations at national and regional conferences as well as publication of research results. Finally, tests of gravity are of great interest to research in diverse fields ranging from astrophysics and cosmology to particle physics and precision measurement science."
0.197617,"This award will provide funds for two groups to participate in the planning for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST is a facility under consideration that will address the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy which are observed to be fundamental components of the Universe that do not fit within the otherwise stunningly successful Standard Model of particle physics. LSST will address these issues in a uniquely powerful way and is planned to be the most ambitious sky survey in the visible band. It will be a large, wide-field, ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky. The survey will feature precision astrometry and photometry and thus will be ideal for measurements of weak lensing and the construction of transient object light curves which is ideal for Supernovae Ia cosmology. <br/><br/>The PIs are members of the LSST project and besides their work on the LSST calibration system they are also members of the LSST Supernova and Large Scale Structure Science collaborations. They are working on a simulation of the LSST calibration to define parameters for design and construction, and during the time frame of this award this work will transition to implementation of a calibration pipeline which will be tested on both simulated LSST raw data and real sky data. <br/><br/>There are several broader impacts of this activity. At Wayne State, undergraduates are included in research via an REU/RET program. At Cincinnati, there is an active QuarkNet program which involves K-12 teachers in research and develops content that they include in their class rooms."
0.9,"PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0801536<br/>INSTITUTION: Case Western Reserve<br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Akerib, Daniel S.<br/><br/>TITLE: Astroparticle Detection <br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation tell us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. <br/><br/>This proposal requests continued base-program support to work on the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment which, in conjunction with the initial funding of the SuperCDMS project grant, will allow for (a) the completion of the CDMS-II experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the Soudan Mine, (b) the testing and underground operation in the CDMS-II infrastructure at Soudan of two new ?SuperTowers,? each comprised of six next-generation detectors, and (c) a modest effort of long-range R&D to develop and test new hardware and detectors for possible followup experiments. <br/><br/>This program will have broader impact than the WIMP search results. The technical development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, which have increasing applications in astrophysics, from optical astronomy to x-rays and cosmic microwave backgrounds studies, as well as other branches of physics such as quantum computing. In addition, the SuperCDMS collaboration will continue its support of public outreach program at Soudan, which hosts thousands of visitors each year for tours of the mine and laboratory."
205.12,"ABSTRACT<br/>Advanced LIGO MREFC Construction <br/><br/>Gravitational waves offer an unprecedented opportunity to see the universe from a new perspective, providing access to astrophysical insights that are available in no other way. Advanced LIGO?s (AdvLIGO) goal is to pioneer a new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. AdvLIGO is an upgrade to the initial Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors and will take place over FY 2008 ? FY 2015. LIGO was conceived as an infrastructure to support a series of improving instruments, and AdvLIGO will re-use the civil construction, vacuum equipment, and environmental monitoring system while replacing the detector components at the Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA observatory sites. The AdvLIGO design is the product of the LIGO Laboratory research and development program and the focused effort of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, informed by the experience from initial LIGO. The complete AdvLIGO detector consists of three interferometers: one 4-km instrument at the Livingston site, and two 4-km instruments at the Hanford site. The instruments are taken through integration and test, with the prime project objective met when each interferometer is capable of being brought reliably to an operational state (?locking?) for multi-hour periods. The Caltech-MIT LIGO Laboratory, with Caltech as the responsible fiduciary institution, will carry out the project. Other members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), on subcontract from Caltech/MIT, will participate in all phases of the effort. The UK (Science and Technology Facilities Council funding) and Germany (Max Planck Institute funding) are contributing significant capital equipment and manpower, complementing the NSF funding.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: AdvLIGO will increase the sensitivity over initial LIGO by more than a factor of 10, and thus the volume searched and potential rate of signals by a factor of more than 1000. The available bandwidth is larger, and the frequency response tunable, to address a range of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. It is anticipated from current astrophysical knowledge that there will be frequent observations of gravitational waves, allowing a broad exploration of heretofore inaccessible astrophysics, cosmology, and relativity. Tests of general relativity in the strong field region near black holes will provide data that will help advance numerical relativity and gravitational theory. AdvLIGO will observe in coordination with other gravitational-wave detectors. The resulting observations will complement those from existing photon and neutrino observatories, increasing their reach, and giving new qualitative and quantitative understanding of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: AdvLIGO is the long-term focus of the entire LSC, including 46 institutions and roughly 600 members globally. In this light, implementing AdvLIGO will directly support a scientific community which came into being due to LIGO. In addition, LSC education and outreach activities of member institutions (including the LIGO Laboratory?s very active program) will be greatly enhanced by the onset of gravitational-wave astronomy -- and the new eye on the universe, achieved by pushing instrument science to fundamental limits, will inspire a generation of young people to consider the excitement of science and engineering as a career."
0.14,"9704338 Kapouleas The proposal consists of two somewhat distinct groups of projects. The first group of project deals with various geometric constructions by singular pertubation methods. These include constructions using desingularization of intersecting minimal surfaces, minimal hypersurfaces and constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in higher dimensional Euclidean space, and Einstein four-manifolds. The second group of projects lie in the area of general relativity. In particular, the PI, in collaboration with Christodoulou, will try to settle uniqueness and stability questions for the Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes. Minimal surfaces arise as various physical surfaces; they have the remarkable property of minimizing the surface area amongst all surfaces bounded by the same spatial contour. Minimal surfaces can also used to model condensed matter. Stability questions for black holes, which involve examining the interaction of a black hole with weak gravitational waves, have important applications in cosmology."
0.005,"Recently,considerable progress has been made in the study of string theories.<br/>It has been realized that superstring theory has a web of duality symmetries relating<br/>nonperturbative effects to perturbative ones.

Another recent development<br/>has been Maldacena's conjectured equivalence between string theory on anti-de Sitter<br/>spaces and gauge field theories living on the boundary of these spaces. This ADS/CFT<br/>equivalence gave more importance to the study of gravitational anti-de Sitter<br/>configurations as they provide a tool to the study of quantum gauge field theories<br/>important for particle physics.

0.4,"""Neutrinos are the least understood of the fundamental particles. While similar to electrons, they interact very weakly with other particles. Thus, little is known about how neutrinos interact with matter. Contrary to earlier expectations, recent experiments have shown that neutrinos have a small but finite mass. The research enabled by this CAREER award will explore how the origin and consequences of neutrino mass may be probed using (1) man-made beams of neutrinos incident at a detector after passing thousands of kilometers through the earth, (2) neutrinos from galactic supernovae, and (3) collisions of high-energy protons in collider experiments. Another aspect of the research program is to study the interactions of ultra high-energy cosmic neutrinos in the hope that new phenomena at energies inaccessible at particle colliders may be discovered. The latter will utilize the extensive data expected from cosmic ray experiments and neutrino telescopes. The overall research program includes the phenomenological analyses of data, the design of future experiments and the assessment of their potential, and the formulation of theoretical neutrino mass models and their tests. <br/><br/>The impact of this work arises from the synergy between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology related to neutrinos. The goal of the research is to improve the current understanding of the neutrino sector of the Standard Model of particle physics with a point of view that may shed light on the unification of forces, the physics applicable when the Big Bang occurred and the role of neutrinos in the evolution of the Universe. The interdisciplinary nature of the projects is bound to engender new avenues of research and will foster collaborations between researchers in diverse fields. The students participating in this research will gain valuable expertise beyond their primary area of research. The local QuarkNet Center will be used to introduce teachers to the frontiers of physics and engage them in discussions about the elements of a scientifically sound theory.

A focus will be on the low-energy elementary particle phenomena, which are somewhat difficult to interpret theoretically. Theoretical Studies will involve the formulation of new theories, and will also deepen our knowledge of existing theories such as General Relativity, whose content has not yet been explored fully.

0.02,"9400243 YANG Three main projects are proposed. The first project is a study of the cosmic string solutions of the coupled Einstein and Yang--Mills--Higgs equations. Problems such as the structure of coupling in view of physical constants and gauge groups, existence and nonexistence of regular stationary solutions will be investigated. Solutions of this type have applications in early universe physics and the theory of galaxy formation. The second project is a study of a variational problem arising from a field-theoretical framework of nuclear interactions. The main problem is to minimize an energy functional among all configuration maps in various homotopy classes. The homotopy class plays the role of a topological constraint which takes an integral form. Existence, regularity, and behavior of the minimizers will be investigated. The third project is a study of the energy gap equation in the Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer microscopic theory of superconductivity. Problems such as the determination of the critical transition temperature, the uniqueness of a full space solution, and numerical approximations of superconducting states will be investigated. The proposed research considers nonlinear problems arising from several important areas of theoretical physics, including superconductivity, cosmology, and nuclear systems. The mathematical analysis and solutions will help better understand these problems, open new areas of mathematical research, and enhance the interactions of modern mathematics with physics. The methods developed will also be useful and stimulating to other related fields of applied, numerical, and pure mathematics."

0.15,"The goal of the proposal is to study efficient mixed finite element methods for the computation of transport maps in optimal transportation problems. The focus is on problems in which the cost of transport is a quadratic function of the distance. They lead to Monge-Ampere equations.

In the second part, techniques of mixed finite element analysis are adapted to the approximation of smooth solutions of the equation.<br/><br/>Optimal transportation has a growing application in various fields ranging from theoretical ones such as geometry and analysis to applied fields such as biology, pattern recognition, image processing, fluid mechanics, geophysics, meteorology, optics, oceanography and cosmology. This has created the critical need for efficient and robust numerical methods backed up theoretically to solve optimal transportation problems. The efficient and reliable methods developed from this project could be used to solve optimal transportation problems which appear in many other applications e.g. weather forecasting, traffic congestion, economics, mesh equidistribution, texture mapping, etc. The proposal studies the Monge-Ampere equation of optimal transportation with the goal of clarifying theoretically the use of the efficient mixed finite element methods.

0.07285,"Proposal DMS-0303326<br/>P.I.: Kristopher Tapp (Bryn Mawr College)<br/><br/>Title: Positive and nonnegative curvature on bundles<br/><br/>ABSTRACT:<br/><br/>In recent research, the PI developed tools for studying the following two <br/>general problems in Riemannian geometry: (1) For which vector bundles does <br/>the total space admit a complete Riemannian metric with nonnegative sectional <br/>curvature? (2) For which sphere bundles does the total space admit a <br/>Riemannian metric with positive curvature? The PI plans to use these tools <br/>to find new examples, obstructions, and rigidity theorems. In particular, <br/>the PI plans to construct metrics of nonnegative curvature on holomorphic <br/>vector bundles over complex projective space, and determine whether Einstein-<br/>Hermitian connections can appear as the connections in the normal bundles of <br/>their souls. Also, the PI intends to study nonnegatively curved metrics on <br/>trivial vector bundles over spheres. This problem is related to the Hopf <br/>conjecture, or more specifically to the question: how large is the family of <br/>nonnegatively curved metrics on the product of two spheres? The PI will work <br/>with undergraduate students studying the metrics on such products obtained by <br/>re-scaling the product metric by a compact Lie group which acts by <br/>isometries. Finally, the PI proposes to find obstructions to metrics of <br/>nonnegative curvature on vector bundles over spheres with prescribed soul <br/>metrics.<br/><br/>The question of which manifolds can have nonnegative curvature is central to <br/>Riemannian geometry. Nonnegative curvature is a visually natural restriction <br/>on the way in which an object curves about in space. All known examples come <br/>from compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics, which are indispensable <br/>tools in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, and other <br/>disciplines in which simplification is achieved through symmetry. The search <br/>for new examples of manifolds with nonnegative (or positive) curvature has a <br/>long history, yet very few constructions are known.

0.114,"Abstract<br/><br/>Award: DMS-0604805<br/>Principal Investigator: Jian Song<br/><br/>This proposal concerns existence and regularity problems of the<br/>nonlinear Monge-Ampere type equations from geometry and physics.<br/>The problem of finding canonical metrics on a compact Kahler<br/>manifold has been the subject of intense study over the last few<br/>decades. In his solution to Calabi's conjecture, Yau proved the<br/>existence of a Kahler-Einstein metric on compact Kahler manifolds<br/>with vanishing or negative first Chern class. An alternative<br/>proof of Calabi's conjecture is given by Cao using the<br/>Kahler-Ricci flow. However, most projective algebraic varieties<br/>do not have definite or trivial first Chern classes. Recently<br/>Perelman has made major breakthrough in Hamilton's program as an<br/>approach to the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization<br/>conjecture. The principal investigator proposes to study the<br/>canonical metrics on the canonical models of projective varieties<br/>of positive Kodaira dimension by applying the Kahler-Ricci<br/>flow. Such canonical metrics are constructed by the deformation<br/>of the Kaher-Ricci flow on minimal projective surfaces of<br/>positive Kodaira dimension. These generalized Kahler-Einstein<br/>metrics can be considered as an analytic version of the abundance<br/>conjecture in algebraic geometry and will also lead to new<br/>advances in the understanding and application of the Ricci<br/>flow. In Donaldson's far reaching program, the geometry of the<br/>infinite dimensional symmetric space of Kahler metrics in a fixed<br/>class is related to the existence and uniqueness of constant<br/>scalar curvature Kahler metrics. The principal investigator also<br/>intends to study the uniform approximation problem of the<br/>Monge-Ampere geodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by<br/>those in the finite dimensional Bergman spaces on toric<br/>varieties. The precise understanding of this problem will give<br/>new insight into the conjecture proposed by Yau between the<br/>relation of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics and certain<br/>stability in the sense of geometric invariant theory. The<br/>principal investigator will also apply the moment map point of<br/>view and study various geometric flows arising from Kahler<br/>geometry as well as symplectic geometry proposed by<br/>Donaldson. The first is the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of<br/>functional related to the Mabuchi energy. The second is a moment<br/>map flow in a hyperkahler four manifold.

Trilling and Buie both participate in the ongoing, large-scale Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) for KBOs and will use the DES database as the backbone of their science endeavors. The tasks to be carried out are as follows. Trilling will make new observations in the DES program. Trilling and Buie will also carry out a comprehensive photometry program that will be used to calibrate the DES catalog. Both of these observing tasks will make extensive use of telescopes in Arizona and Chile. Lastly, Trilling and Buie will carry out completeness experiments on the DES catalog. These three tasks prepare the way for scientific analysis of the Kuiper Belt using the 500 DES KBOs. The first step of the science analysis will be to carry out a statistical study of the DES data in combination with other surveys' data to derive, with strong confidence, the differential sky density of KBOs. This mathematical expression can be directly related to accretion timescales through theoretical models to provide a tight constraint on the duration of accretion in the Kuiper Belt. Lastly, combining the DES dataset with newly available KBO albedo information from the Space Infrared Telescope Facility allows a true KBO size distribution to be derived for the first time. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of these technical tasks and science goals lies in the quest to understand<br/>how the outer Solar System formed and evolved. The results derived here will be crucially important in constraining and driving the next generation of outer Solar System accretion models. These models have impact beyond the Kuiper Belt, as planets in the Solar System (and beyond) underwent accretion as part of their formation processes. This program will have a broader impact in the community primarily through participation in the University of Arizona Space Grant program.

This series of students will have specific research tasks, including participating in observing runs. Trilling will also participate in Space Grant's Science Speakers program to present science results in classrooms and to the general public. Such a program uniquely allows bringing knowledge to communities of racial, ethnic, and economic diversity.

In this project, we aim to study one very rich<br/>type of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which<br/>is already known to have a number of quite subtle<br/>characteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small<br/>piece has less area than any other surface with the same<br/>boundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in<br/>physical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,<br/>the problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating<br/>droplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications<br/>range from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of<br/>stable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many<br/>other optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we<br/>do not have much general information about solutions to the<br/>equation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a<br/>wide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and<br/>which we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model<br/>problem, enriching our understanding of all optimization<br/>problems."
0.225,"AST 0206031<br/>Jimenez <br/><br/>The field of Cosmology has had unprecedented development in the last 80 years. We now have an extremely successful and simple model: the universe was created during the Big Bang, expanded in an inflationary phase, and the galaxies were formed via gravitational instabilities from tiny initial quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, we now know that the universe is made up mostly of a mysterious ""dark energy"" (70%) with the remaining mass consisting of some kind of dark matter (25%) and ordinary matter (5%). This model has passed impressive tests at physical scales larger than that of galaxy clusters. However, at galaxy scales, the current paradigm is not as successful. There seems to be much less dark matter at the centers of galaxies than is predicted by computer simulations. <br/><br/>This project will study an important ingredient, which has been missing from these computer simulations: supermassive black holes and other condensed forms of matter. Preliminary simulations by Dr Jimenez and his collaborators have shown that such objects can displace a significant amount of dark matter from the centers of galaxies. These preliminary calculations will be extended and refined with the aim of testing whether the standard paradigm can be reconciled with the observations. In addition, this project will investigate the nature of the elusive dark matter particles. This will be done by calculating the flux of gamma rays expected from the self-annihilation of dark matter particles at the galactic center. This flux depends both on the evolutionary history of the galaxy, and on the precise masses of the dark matter particles.<br/>***"

They are extraordinarily stable natural clocks, in some cases approaching or exceeding the long-term stabilities of the best man-made clocks. Well over 1000 pulsars are now known, and several dozen of them are gravitationally bound to another star, with orbital velocities up to a thousandth of the speed of light. For these and many other reasons,<br/>high-precision observations of pulsars offer unique opportunities for research in stellar evolution, gravitation physics, cosmology, fundamental astrometry, and even time-keeping metrology.<br/><br/>This project will extend and improve a series of very-high precision timing measurements of binary and millisecond pulsars as refined tests of relativistic effects, and in the search for perturbations in pulse times series due to passing gravitational waves. They will also search the sky for new pulsars, particularly those with very short periods, and they will accumulate timing data for more than 100 slow pulsars, as a service to observers at other wavelengths and to study pulsar rotation irregularities.<br/>***"
0.416307,"Even after more than a decade of great discoveries, the neutrino remains the most mysterious of the known fundamental particles. Basic questions about its properties endure; the most basic being whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle. If true, this Majorana nature of the neutrino would have profound implications to particle physics and cosmology, including an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The only feasible experimental probes of the Majorana nature of the neutrino are experiments searching for the rare nuclear process, neutrinoless double-beta decay. The current set of experiments will probe the parameter space for Majorana neutrinos in the inverted mass hierarchy. The next generation of experiments will need to push into the normal mass hierarchy which requires an order of magnitude increase in mass and background suppression. <br/><br/>Liquid scintillator detectors scale well to large masses but advances are needed to obtain increased background suppression. This award will support a program of research that focusses on combining advances in photodetectors and the use of novel wavelength shifters in the form of nanocrystals called quantum dots to extract a directional signal from liquid scintillator detectors.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Undergraduate research is critical for recruiting and retaining physics students. This award will be used to improve opportunities for transfer students. A seminar series on succeeding as a physics major will be developed and presented at UCLA. A modified version of the series will also be presented at Santa Monica College. Furthermore, this grant will sponsor an additional slot in UCLA's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program."
3.0,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. This work will have a broad impact which extends beyond a dark matter search. The technical developments will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award will provide support for the design and fabrication of a next-generation (G2) experiment, SuperCDMS SNOLAB, which will operate at the deepest large clean underground laboratory in the world. The high background rejection and control of contamination that the SuperCDMS technology offers provide significant advantages compared to other technologies. The baseline design for this new experiment will deploy an initial 50 kg payload of germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) detectors. Some of these detectors will be operated in a manner that provides very low energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to the lowest dark matter particle masses (< 0.5 GeV) and multiple-target complementarity in a single experiment. It will provide a strong possibility of the discovery of particle dark matter and detailed information on its properties.<br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, using techniques at the leading edge of measurement technologies. SuperCDMS scientists will continue their involvement in public outreach, collaboration with K-12 teachers, and support for Berkeley physics majors who are training to teach science and for promising high school students from underserved backgrounds."
0.024998,"AST-0205080<br/>Goldberg, David M.<br/><br/>One of the outstanding questions in extra-galactic astronomy and cosmology pertains to the search for the missing matter in the universe. Dark matter lies hidden in the largest galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and until the advent of gravitational lensing, there was no way to probe the outer reaches of these objects. Weak lensing analysis has proven a boon to modern astrophysics in that it allows for an accurate measurement of cluster masses without recourse to assumptions about the dynamical state of the system, its composition, or its 3-dimensional geometry. Lensing introduces an elliptical distortion to galaxies behind clusters. The mean ellipticity determined from many background galaxies may then be used to reconstruct the cluster's gravitational potential, and thus its mass distribution. This analysis has already been successfully applied to a number of galaxies, clusters, and to large-scale structure generally. In previous work, the awardee has expanded existing lensing analysis to second-order, thus describing a transition regime in which lensing is too weak to produce dramatic arcs, but for which an arc-like signal can still be detected. The present project will expand upon this previous work. These techniques, if successfully demonstrated, can be applied to a number of existing and publicly available datasets. The award is for seed funding for a proof of concept of advanced lensing analysis.<br/>***"
0.390973,"This project is motivated by successful deployment of eScience applications<br/>on clouds: how to deploy HPC analytics applications on the cloud?

0.375,"Whereas traditional high-performance computing (HPC) applications are computationally intensive, recent HPC applications require more data-intensive analysis and visualization to extract knowledge. In many cases, these applications execute the same computational algorithm as in the past (e.g., parallel search or parallel rendering) but now must do so for significantly larger data sets. For example, the life sciences, along with the cross-cutting area of scientific visualization, constitute an emerging category of HPC applications that not only perform sophisticated calculations but also ingest a sea of data. Running these new HPC data-parallel applications on today's computing platforms imposes new challenges and demands additional functionality.<br/><br/>However, today's HPC platforms still adopt a compute-centric model and do not handle these new challenges well. Such a model often moves a large amount of data to various parallel computational processes. Consequently, long CPU wait times for I/O to complete and enormous data-movement overhead become major stumbling blocks to high performance and scalability. This project encompasses the creation of a scalable cross-layer software framework to enable both computationally intensive and data-intensive parallel HPC applications to run on distributed file systems. This framework consists of two interwoven research tasks: (1) an adaptive, data locality-aware, middleware system that dynamically schedules compute processes to access local data by monitoring physical data locations and (2) a framework that captures the computation and data I/O processing relationship from parallel applications and coordinates the scheduling of the corresponding process and I/O execution for maximum parallel efficiency. The success of this project contributes enhanced productivity and return on investment on HPC resources via the elimination of both CPU wait time and network transfer of frequently accessed data in scientific applications. An open-source, sustainable, and reusable software framework is delivered to speed-up the discovery and innovation process in areas such as bioinformatics, climate, high-energy physics, cosmology, astrophysics, and chromodynamics. The synergy in the two proposing institutions, Virginia Tech and the University of Central Florida, and their collaborating DOE national laboratories, will catalyze new and beneficial perspectives in the graduate education of students and prepare a 21st-century workforce in HPC."

They result from changes in boundary conditions or of classical backgrounds for quantized fields. The corresponding Casimir forces can dominate at micro- and nano-meter distances and in very strong gravitational fields. Building on the recently vastly improved understanding of such effects, this investigation will advance numerical and semi-classical estimates of Casimir energies and forces. World-line methods and algorithms are to be developed to the point that they permit the computation of Casimir forces in realistic systems with unprecedented accuracy. By directly generating convex surfaces with the appropriate probability measure very accurate vacuum forces could be obtained for a large class of convex bodies. The existing world-line formalism for calculating vacuum energies of scalar fields satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions is to be extended to include other boundary conditions and ultimately compute vacuum forces due to quantum electrodynamics. The non-perturbative inclusion of effects due to surface roughness will also be investigated. Semi-classical methods will be used to analyze and guide the design of more efficient algorithms. Semi-classical periodic orbit theory will be further developed and applied to estimate changes in vacuum energy due to periodic classical photon orbits in the extreme space-times near (micro-) black holes and the early universe.<br/>The project introduces new analytic and computational methods to research in other fields as well. A well-defined stochastic measure on convex surfaces can be used to describe statistical deformations of higher dimensional convex spaces as well as of biological membranes. Stable micro black holes and Casimir effects due to extreme gravitational backgrounds could improve our understanding of dark matter and of dark energy. Accurate numerical estimates of Casimir forces in complex geometries furthermore will reduce development costs and improve the functionality of micro- and nano- mechanical devices. The control and efficient manipulation of vacuum forces is essential in the progressive miniaturization of mechanical devices. This project thus is at the heart of an emerging field of increasing technological importance. The project provides a post-doctoral associate the opportunity to contribute significantly to these developments.<br/><br/>The activity is well-positioned to recruit and promote the work of under-represented minorities.

0.135904,"AST 0098499<br/>Hakkila<br/><br/>Despite tremendous scientific breakthroughs during the past two decades, gamma-ray burst (GRB) astro-physics is still in its infancy. GRBs are the most energetic events in the universe. Further understanding of the GRB phenomenon rests in part on understand-ing distinct behaviors that can be associated with physical mechanisms. Identification of distinct physical behaviors (e.g. classification) is an important component of the scientific method. However, distinct behaviors do not always indicate the presence of separate source populations. The complex, overlapping properties of GRBs are a case in point: they have long confounded efforts to subclassify their behaviors. Many identified behaviors have been shown to result from either instrumental or sampling biases. GRB classification can be better carried out using statistically and computationally rigorous approaches of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) combined with a detailed understanding of instrumental and sampling biases. <br/><br/>Recently, there have been claims that certain attributes correlate with burst lumi-nosity. The claims, however, are based on a very limited data set of GRBs with afterglows, and on attributes that have only been defined for a small subset of bursts observed by BATSE (the Burst And Transient Source Experiment on NASA's defunct Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory). Are the correlation's between luminosity and these attributes self-consistent with observations of the large BATSE data set? Do instrumental biases play any role in these apparent correlations? All GRBs with afterglows thus far belong to the long class of GRBs; is there similar evidence for these behaviors in the short class of GRBs? Do these attributes indicate the presence of other GRB subclasses? These questions will be addressed in this project using a large GRB database, a set of well-defined and appropriate attributes, detailed knowledge of the instrument(s) from which the observations are made, and KDD methodology. After this database has been produced, pattern recognition algorithms will be applied to GRB classifica-tion. Based on preliminary results, it is expected that general GRB subclasses will be identified, as well as substructures indicative of specific GRB behaviors.<br/><br/>As a part of this project, a database of complex preprocessed GRB attributes will be developed and made available via the World Wide Web.

In his solution to Calabi's conjecture, Yau proved the<br/>existence of a Kahler-Einstein metric on compact Kahler manifolds<br/>with vanishing or negative first Chern class. An alternative<br/>proof of Calabi's conjecture is given by Cao using the<br/>Kahler-Ricci flow. However, most projective algebraic varieties<br/>do not have definite or trivial first Chern classes. Recently<br/>Perelman has made major breakthrough in Hamilton's program as an<br/>approach to the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization<br/>conjecture. The principal investigator proposes to study the<br/>canonical metrics on the canonical models of projective varieties<br/>of positive Kodaira dimension by applying the Kahler-Ricci<br/>flow. Such canonical metrics are constructed by the deformation<br/>of the Kaher-Ricci flow on minimal projective surfaces of<br/>positive Kodaira dimension. These generalized Kahler-Einstein<br/>metrics can be considered as an analytic version of the abundance<br/>conjecture in algebraic geometry and will also lead to new<br/>advances in the understanding and application of the Ricci<br/>flow. In Donaldson's far reaching program, the geometry of the<br/>infinite dimensional symmetric space of Kahler metrics in a fixed<br/>class is related to the existence and uniqueness of constant<br/>scalar curvature Kahler metrics. The principal investigator also<br/>intends to study the uniform approximation problem of the<br/>Monge-Ampere geodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by<br/>those in the finite dimensional Bergman spaces on toric<br/>varieties. The precise understanding of this problem will give<br/>new insight into the conjecture proposed by Yau between the<br/>relation of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics and certain<br/>stability in the sense of geometric invariant theory. The<br/>principal investigator will also apply the moment map point of<br/>view and study various geometric flows arising from Kahler<br/>geometry as well as symplectic geometry proposed by<br/>Donaldson. The first is the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of<br/>functional related to the Mabuchi energy. The second is a moment<br/>map flow in a hyperkahler four manifold.

1.438,"The PIs on this proposal will perform research in a variety of exciting areas in theoretical physics, including extensions of the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking, quantum chromodynamics, neutrino physics, supersymmetry, anomalies and boundary conditions in quantum field theory, conformal field theory, the quantization of the superstring, and the geometry of string compactifications. <br/>Quantum field theory is the language of elementary particles and forces. Among quantum field theories, the so-called Standard Model describes the known forces in Nature aside from gravity, namely the electromagnetic, weak and strong forces. Among the mysteries not addressed by the Standard Model is the problem of ""generations"", a <br/>three-fold repetition of particle types. Another is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking, or precisely how the weak interactions become weak. It is widely hoped that the Large Hadron Collider at CERN will begin providing qualitatively new insights into these issues within the next few years. Indeed, it is expected that many proposals for extensions of the Standard Model, especially those with supersymmetry, will be tested. In supersymmetric models, known particles all have as-yet undetected ""partners"", whose presence improves the quantum behavior of the theory. Experiments over recent years have also confirmed that neutrinos, which only interact via the weak forces, have <br/>small but nonzero masses, not envisioned in the construction of the Standard Model. Neutrinos masses also have profound consequences for astrophysics and cosmology. <br/>The strong force in the Standard Model is described by the field theory quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is central to experimental programs for observing new signals. It also exhibits crucial aspects of quantum field theory that are not yet understood, and presents both ""weak coupling"" and ""strong coupling"" behaviors. Work in weak-coupling, or perturbative, QCD serves both to make predictions for signals of new physics and their backgrounds. The strong-coupling behavior of the theory is studied to understand the structure of the nucleons, and for its relation to other theories, including string theory. String theory is the only known finite quantum theory of gravity, and has inspired many new insights into quantum field theories, especially QCD and its supersymmetric extensions. It is the only candidate for a theory that unifies all the known forces. It has given insights into the nature of black holes and revealed profound links to many aspects of modern mathematics. It suggests many proposals for new physics to be seen at the LHC. <br/><br/>The proposed research will have a broad impact by advancing our <br/>knowledge of the laws on Nature and contributing toward a better understanding of the physical universe. Indeed, many of the topics under study by the senior participants are widely discussed in the media, such as the role of ""ghostly"" neutrinos in the Universe, and hopes of physicists for the soon-to-be-commissioned Large Hadron Collider. The research outlined in this proposal will serve in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The faculty on this proposal are often involved in outreach efforts to reach a broader public. These include public lectures through the Run Run Shaw series and summer workshops in physics and mathematics supported by the Simons foundation.

This general problem has been the central theme of differential geometry since its conception over one hundered years ago. Specifically, these investigators will study the behavior of geodesics along curved manifolds. On the surface of a sphere, great circles are the only geodesics. But on other more complex surfaces, geodesics can take on many surprising properties.

0.2,"An aperture array is a group of antennas that can be deployed in particular geometric patterns to detect radio signals at a given range of frequencies. Using an array is beneficial for electrical engineering because it can magnify a radio signal in the direction of that signal while suppressing noise and interference through a process known as beamforming. In addition, an antenna array can be used to detect the direction and distance of the signal's source. Aperture arrays are a crucial component of scientific instruments that measure the spatial distribution of radio sources. For example, radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) instrument, rely on aperture arrays to generate precise radio images of electromagnetic sources for experimental cosmology and space science. These instruments image the sky using closely spaced radio beams known as radio pixels. Closely packed sets of such beams can be achieved by using hexagonal pixel grids, which are considered ideal for scientific studies. In order to build aperture beamformers to be used for a specific purpose, efficient schemes for processing the antenna array signals must be developed to reduce the computing time, energy consumption, and costs for the hardware required in the system. The proposed research creates new algorithms and digital computing architectures that will produce highly-focused hexagonal radio pixels for the most demanding of microwave imaging applications. The same aperture arrays are used in radar and wireless communication systems for signature detection and signal intelligence. In fact, aperture arrays are absolutely essential for national security and public safety from a threat detection perspective. In addition to its scientific merits and benefits for national security, this project will train highly qualified personnel (HQP), who will contribute to commercial industry, scientific research, public safety agencies, and the defense sector. Specific efforts will focus on promoting Women in Engineering programs in higher education to recruit and guide female engineering students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. <br/><br/>The proposed research tackles the problem of highly directional sparse aperture arrays using the mathematical properties of multi-dimensional recursive digital filters. The NSF-sponsored effort will develop hardware systems for aperture arrays based on the proposed concept of network-resonant phased-arrays (NRPAs). Multi-dimensional (MD) circuit theory and digital hardware form an enabling technology for imaging algorithms that can greatly improve performance over traditional technologies. This research proposes groundbreaking techniques based on array signal processing, circuits and systems. It will result in a significant improvement in the directional sensitivity while using a lower number of array elements compared to traditional phased array receivers of the same sensitivity. The proposed NRPAs combine the concept of network resonance with phased array technology to gain significant improvement in both directionality and sensitivity. The MD circuit theoretical concept of network resonance allows digital beamformers to have complex pole manifolds. These properties are shown to have advantages in terms of ultra-wideband frequency response, exceptional directionality, multi-beams with shape control, rapid steerability, and low computational complexity. This project investigates radio beams with a hexagonal sky-print for optimal sensing and microwave imaging over wide fields-of-view and bandwidths. The proposed NRPAs will be extended to both sparse and random arrays via theoretical formulations for decreasing hardware cost, reducing energy expended in computers and increasing design flexibility."

For nearly a century, physicists have used quantum mechanics to understand many properties of the physical world, from the behavior of atoms and molecules to the nuclear forces that govern sub-atomic particles. Predictions from the theory have matched experimental observations to impeccable accuracy. Conceptually, however, the theory includes some strikingly strange features. Among the most curious is known as ""quantum entanglement."" According to quantum mechanics, particles that have been prepared in a special way can retain a connection, even after they have moved arbitrarily far apart from each other--a property which Albert Einstein dubbed ""spooky actions at a distance."" Nowadays entanglement is at the heart of many cutting-edge technologies, including quantum encryption and quantum computing. Yet every experimental test of quantum entanglement to date has been subject to various loopholes: alternative explanations, different than quantum theory, that might account for the long-distance correlations in the particles' behavior. In this project, the principal investigators aim to address the most stubborn, and least studied, of these loopholes, known as the ""setting independence loophole."" To shield against any unintended coordination between the particles and the measurement apparatus--coordination that could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics--the selection of which properties of the particles to be measured will be determined by real-time observation of some of the oldest light in our universe: light that was emitted from astronomical objects so far away from Earth and from each other that neither object would have been able to receive any signals from each other prior to the moment they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. The new series of experiments will thus test entanglement on an entirely new scale. If, as expected, the results match the predictions from quantum mechanics, then any alternatives will be ruled out or severely constrained, and new technologies such as quantum encryption will be placed on the strongest possible footing. If, on the other hand, the experiment finds novel departures from predictions, that could point toward profoundly new physics. This project also has an informal education component that will take place through exhibits and programs at the MIT Museum; these will connect the public to the experiment as it evolves in real time, and will be evaluated and widely disseminated. <br/><br/>Experimental tests of Bell's inequality have been subject to several loopholes which hold out the possibility, however slim, that individual particles could possess simultaneously sharp values for noncommuting variables. Such behavior would be at odds with quantum mechanics, and would subject quantum-encryption protocols to new vulnerabilities. The most subtle loophole is known as ""setting independence."" In any test of entanglement, one must select detector settings on each side of the experimental apparatus, choosing to measure, for example, a particle's spin along the x-axis, the y-axis, or some intermediate angle. The usual assumption is that no third party, acting in the shared causal past of the entangled particles and the measurement apparatus, has affected the joint probability distribution for detector settings. Yet even a tiny coordination among detector settings and the entangled particles could mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics. In this series of experiments, the principal investigators aim to address the setting-independence loophole using real-time observations of distant astronomical sources, such as quasars--sources that were causally isolated from each other and from the worldline of the Earth at the time they emitted the light that is observed on Earth today. Any non-quantum-mechanical coordination among elements of the experiment would thereby be pushed back billions of years, in some scenarios back to the big bang itself, an improvement of 20 orders of magnitude over current constraints."

The theoretical part of the proposal will quantify how accurately future 21 cm tomography data can constrain the cosmic expansion history and dark energy, the cosmic clustering history and dark matter/neutrino masses, primordial non-Gaussianity, and inflation. The experimental part will study a new concept in this field, a radio telescope with elements on a regular grid that can cut computing requirements significantly by using fast Fourier transforms. This is a highly cost-effective design relative to traditional radio arrays, and the award will fund continued development of a prototype telescope array. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this proposal include training of underrepresented graduate students, undergraduate student projects, and public outreach featuring high school lectures, popular talks, and articles on cosmology."
0.252763,"AST-0607739<br/>Kulkarni<br/><br/>The evolution of galaxies and the production of chemical elements in the Universe are fundamental issues in astrophysics and cosmology. A powerful tool for tracing the evolution of stars, gas, and metals in galaxies is provided by the spectral lines of damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorbers that lie along the sightlines to quasars. Fundamental tests of galaxy evolution models come from constraining the cosmic density of metals and stars in galaxies. At present, DLA observations contradict the predictions of most cosmic chemical evolution models. However, the existing low-redshift samples are still relatively small, and include far too few sub-DLAs or dusty DLAs, and there have been very few high-resolution imaging studies of the absorbers. This project will investigate these issues by obtaining high-resolution spectroscopic and imaging observations for a large sample of low-redshift DLAs and sub-DLAs with known neutral hydrogen column densities. This will provide fundamental tests of galaxy evolution models by constraining the cosmic density of metals and stars in galaxies. This research will use publicly available archival data as well as new data to be obtained at state-of-the-art facilities.<br/><br/>Educational benefits accrue from the research training of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of South Carolina, in a region with very few astronomers, and especially very few minority or women astronomers. Thus, the program provides unique career advancement, recruiting, and mentoring opportunities for under-represented groups. The Principal Investigator will also continue active development of new graduate and upper level undergraduate courses, and her extensive outreach activities through the USC Melton Observatory and the South Carolina State Museum."
0.95999,"The fundamental question of neutrino mass is important in cosmology, the study of the evolution of the universe, and for the completion of a theory of elementary particles. Neutrinos are the most prolific particles in the universe, and only since 1998 has it been established that they have any mass at all. It has now been well established experimentally, that in traversing from the sun to earth, and those created in our upper atmosphere, do change from one type to another, which requires that they do have mass. Determining their mass may also determine if they could account for part of the dark matter (sometimes called the missing mass of the universe). These experiments called neutrino oscillation experiments; however, cannot tell us how much mass they possess, just that their masses are not zero. There are two methods to directly determine the masses of neutrinos. <br/>In the first method, a precision measurement is made of the energy spectra of beta particles from radioactive decay of light nuclei. The deviation from the canonical theoretical shape of the energy spectrum near the high-energy end is a measure of the mass of the electron-type neutrino. These experiments are very difficult and are somewhat limited in mass sensitivity. Nevertheless, within their range of sensitivity, they are very valuable.<br/>In the case that neutrinos are their own anti-particles, there is an exotic radioactive decay called neutrinoless double-beta decay, that would be far more sensitive to neutrino mass. In addition, establishing by direct observation that this process exists, would prove that neutrinos are their own anti-particles. This in itself is extremely important for completing the theory of elementary particles. It would also support specific models of the very early universe that explain why the universe is almost completely particles at present, with almost no anti-particles. Without some small excess of particles over anti-particles in the very early universe, we ourselves, and all we see, could not exist today. <br/>The projects CUORE and Majorana are both large, next generation neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. They are being designed to probe a mass range a factor of ten more sensitive than presently exists from three experiments, two of which the PI of this grant participated in with leadership roles. The Majorana experiment is a proposed 500 kg array of high purity Ge detectors, isotopically enriched in 76Ge, the candidate parent double beta decay nucleus. It involves five national laboratories and eight universities. It would be built in the US with US technology. I involves many graduate students and will be a prolific source of PhD thesis material. There are a number of spin-off technologies useful in nuclear weapon non-proliferation and in homeland defense.<br/>CUORE is a proposed 750 kg array of cryogenic detectors of tellurium oxide to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of the isotope 130Te. It is a collaboration between Italy and the US, and is being constructed in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. It is a new technology because of its mass. It offers the same kind of educational opportunities as does Majorana, and is training US graduate students and post doctoral scientists in the technology of very large cryogenic detectors that do not exist in the US."
0.147793,"The principal investigator proposes to study various aspects of index theory on singular spaces. The PI and his collaborators will, for example, apply their recent analysis of the resolution of the orbit space of a group action to the index theory of a family of equivariant operators. A similar resolution, but of an arbitrary pseudomanifold, will be used in a project to understand the properties of the signature operator and extend the class of spaces known to satisfy the Novikov conjecture from topology. A related project aims more generally to extend many of the methods of geometric microlocal analysis to the setting of stratified spaces. The PI will also work with his collaborators to understand the spectral geometry of non-compact or singular spaces, with projects to understand isospectrality for non-compact surfaces and extend the class of spaces where the topological Reidemeister torsion can be expressed analytically. Finally, the PI is involved in various efforts to extend the number of mathematicians aware of these results and working in this field, including the production of lecture notes and survey articles as well as the organization of conferences and seminars.<br/><br/>Singular spaces arise naturally in mathematics and physics, even when one is interested in studying smooth phenomena. For instance, recent models in cosmology and particle physics require an understanding of spaces with singularities such as corners and edges. However, many of the techniques used in geometric analysis do not apply to singular spaces. One aspect of this proposal is to contribute to the development and application of new techniques to problems arising in index theory and spectral geometry. These problems are in the intersection of analysis with other fields, such as topology, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics, a confluence which is a source of both problems and applications."
0.394299,"""Studies in Relativistic Physics and Astrophysics""<br/><br/>General relativity is the theoretical foundation of current work on the physics on neutron stars and black holes, on the generation of gravitational waves, and in a broad sense on modern cosmology in general. However, the theory still remains largely untested, except in the weak-field, low-velocity regime. The the research being done under this award addresses several fundamental areas in relativistic physics and astrophysics that are currently ripe for progress. Specific research topics include the physics of accretion onto relativistic objects, possible ways to detect general relativistic effects and constraints on the equation of state and dynamical properties of dense matter in neutron stars. In addition to the theoretical analyses, attention will be given to the planning and analysing of observations designed to probe the properties of dense matter and strong gravitational fields. In this effort, the research program can take full advantage of the new information on black holes and neutron stars that is now being provided by space-based observations."
0.23,"The principal investigator will continue working on his conjecture that functions have a new type of probabilistic structure: associated with certain combinations of first partial derivatives of functions, there are two fields of rotations, and two martingales that are martingale transforms of each other, starting from constants of equal modulus, and ending at what one obtains after rotating these combinations of the derivatives. The immediate focus is the study of the algorithm developed by the PI for creating the martingales; if it can be taken to its conclusion for each function, then that will prove the conjecture. The conjecture is motivated by the problem of the sharp norm of the Beurling-Ahlfors transformation in the plane, and its generalizations to space, but it has a wider scope and implies even stronger inequalities and provides further insight into the geometric behavior of functions. The principal investigator has found that in three dimensions, the conjecture has a new physical interpretation as a relation between the static electric and magnetic fields: they also would be related by rotations and a pair of martingales. Secondly, the principal investigator proposes to study the order of growth and other global properties of the solutions to the Painleve differential equations. <br/><br/>The first part of this project strives to create new structures tying together analysis and probability theory, with a connection to the physics of the static electromagnetic field in dimension three. Work in the second part of the proposal addresses the properties of Painleve transcendents, an important class of nonlinear special functions. Painleve equations appear in numerous ways in current work on other parts of mathematics, such as differential geometry and random matrices. They are being used in ongoing work by a large number of scientists in physics, astronomy, and engineering, for example in the following areas: bubble break-off and other Hele-Shaw problems in incompressible viscous fluids, resonant oscillations in shallow water, general relativity and cosmology, plasma physics, superconductivity, non-linear optics and fiber optics, polymers, polyelectrolytes, and colloids, the Ising model in physics, correlations functions in an antiferromagnet model, quantum field theory and topological field theory. Painleve equations unify many fields as they provide a connection to integrability for non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations. This project contributes to increasing our knowledge of the behavior of the Painleve transcendents and should benefit those applying these equations. The graduate students of the PI will be involved in both parts of the project."

0.453943,"Among the potentially most important results of cosmology in the last decade is the realization that the star formation rate at redshifts z > 1 is higher than at present by about an order of magnitude, and that half of the energy produced since the surface of last scattering has been absorbed and reemitted by dust. Most of the light produced by stars at high redshift thus reaches us in the far infrared. This radiation is referred to as the cosmic infrared background (CIB) and is emitted primarily by dusty, star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3. Embedded in far infrared emission of the CIB is the history of star formation, dust production, and the growth of large scale structures. Most lately, several new observational projects (ACT, SPT, Planck, Herschel) released their &#64257;rst measurements of the CIB. This award will support the development of the theoretical understanding required to make the best of these new observations.<br/><br/>The work promises original insights into the high redshift star formation history of the universe, directly at a period where the star formation peaked. Since this period of galaxy evolution is hard to probe by any other means, the research will help address fundamental issues, such as: (1) the fossil record of galaxy assembly from the &#64257;rst stars to present, (2) the connections between dark and luminous matter, and (3) the formation and evolution of cosmic structures.

The array is heterogeneous, consisting of six 10-m telescopes belonging to Caltech, nine 6-m telescopes from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association, and eight 3.5-m telescopes of The University of Chicago. Not all telescopes currently have the capability to observe at the same wavelength or frequency bandpasses simultaneously. The goal of being able to outfit all telescopes with receivers capable of observing at the same bandpass at the same time will soon be realized.

0.657002,"The research supported by this award aims to further our understanding of gravitational physics in areas ranging from fundamental theory to astrophysical phenomena. Despite the fact that General Relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, is well-confirmed by many tests and observations, outstanding puzzles in both cosmology and quantum gravity motivate investigation of the properties and predictions of various modifications. This research will study, in particular, theories with a preferred reference frame. The focus will be on stability and dynamical viability of such theories. A second theme of the research concerns properties and phenomena associated with spinning black holes, which are the universal endpoint of complete gravitational collapse. Topics to be studied include the mathematical description of such black holes, the limitations on their spin rate, and mechanisms that might produce the extremely energetic jets of matter that are observed to be ejected from their neighborhood. A particular such mechanism involves magnetic energy concentrated in tube-like structures behaving as elastic strings. A third area of the research aims to develop a better understanding of the nature of the entropy of black holes and other influence horizons. In particular, while this entropy appears to obey the second law of thermodynamics, the exact meaning of that statement and its validity remain murky. <br/><br/>The results of this research on modifications of General Relativity will produce a better understanding of the possibilities and problems that entails, and new ways to test the theory and to interpret anomalies if such should arise. The work on spinning black holes will provide insight into the dynamical behavior of such objects, and may contribute to understanding the origin of the high energy jets they sometimes generate. The work on black hole entropy attempts to capitalize on the tantalizing hints of black hole thermodynamics, to use those hints to discover principles of that may govern the underlying theory of quantum gravity. The results of this research will be disseminated through written articles, as well as seminars, conference talks, and lecture series. The research will help to train future scientists in both this research area and related fields through graduate and undergraduate courses taught at the University of Maryland, and through the supervision of research by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs.

He will assemble velocity-resolved maps in the H-alpha line of ionized gas and in neutral hydrogen, to measure the density of gas in the galaxy disk, and its velocity field, for about 100 disk galaxies with a wide range in properties. He will use near-infrared K-band images to determine the distribution of stellar mass, fitting the rotation curves to obtain the mass contributions of the different components. In the low-surface-brightness disks where the dark halo dominates the gravitational forces, he will use the measured velocity field to search for evidence of the steep inner cusp predicted by simulations with standard Cold Dark Matter. The larger sample of galaxies will be used to derive the initial halo mass profiles by proper treatment of adiabatic compression. Finally, he will calibrate an empirical mass-discrepancy--acceleration relation. The mass discrepancy is defined locally as the difference between the observed circular speed of rotation and that predicted from the gas and stars alone. This discrepancy is related to the orbital speed of disk material; the present study aims to characterize that relation better as a step towards understanding its origin.<br/><br/>Dr McGaugh will continue his program of outreach to elementary-school children.

0.098,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, left over from the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Experimental efforts to detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the Galaxy, yielding a sidereal modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. <br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) dark matter experiment is a leader in the field of directional dark matter detection, with sensitivity to the powerful angular signature of nuclear recoils induced by WIMPs. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. The collaboration will be testing their next prototype detector, DRIFT-IIe, above ground at Occidental College. It features an inherently scalable design including a redesigned field cage, a texturized, thin-film cathode, a new, transparent wire readout which doubles the fiducial volume per readout, and a new every-wire data acquisition system which allows for lower noise and fiducialization in the detector plane. <br/><br/>The potential of DRIFT's capabilities have promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience."

0.119999,"AST 0098086<br/>Chandran<br/><br/>Galaxy clusters are among the largest organized structures in the observed universe and play an important role in our understanding of the evolution of the universe as a whole. Intriguingly, these clusters possess vast quantities of plasma (hot ionized gas) in the enormous spaces between their galaxies. Typically, there is much more mass in a cluster's plasma than in all the stars in all the galaxies within a cluster. Because this plasma is such an important constituent of a cluster, its evolution poses an important and challenging problem for astronomers.<br/><br/>With the advent of x-ray satellites, astronomers discovered that intracluster plasmas cool by emitting huge amounts of high energy x-rays. As the plasma within a cluster cools, the pressure within the plasma decreases, which enables gravity to compress the plasma and force it inwards towards the cluster's center. The rate at which plasma flows inwards is currently the subject of considerable controversy within the astrophysical community. Some astronomers believe that the radiative cooling of intracluster plasma is offset by heating. For example, as the plasma near a cluster's center cools, heat can be conducted inwards from the hotter plasma surrounding a cluster's core. Such heating sustains the pressure of the plasma in the core, reducing the rate of inflow. Other astronomers believe that heating of cluster plasma is minimal, so that large quantities of intracluster plasma are accreted towards a cluster's center. This project will help resolve this controversy by determining the efficiency of thermal conduction in galaxy clusters. The subtlety is that intracluster plasmas are turbulent and magnetized. The particles which carry heat from hot regions to cold regions are constrained to move primarily along the magnetic field, so that if the magnetic field has a tangled topology, the transport of heat is slowed. This project will use numerical simulations of turbulent plasmas to determine the rate of heat conduction amidst such tangled magnetic fields. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"

The research experience is completed by a trip to the winter American Astronomical Society meeting, where the intern presents a poster paper and interacts with other scientists.<br/><br/>In addition to the training interns receive by performing a focused research project, students are involved in a variety of complementary activities, including a series of six scientific colloquia given by CfA scientists at a level appropriate for undergraduates, a series of short lecture courses in cosmology and exoplanets, and several organized lunches including one with current graduate students and one with faculty members from the Astronomy Department graduate admissions committee, as well as one to discuss graduate school fellowships. Students are recruited with an emphasis on women, under-represented minorities, and students from colleges where research opportunities in astronomy are limited. <br/><br/>This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the National Science Foundation REU program."
0.178261,"This project will study the millimeter/sub-millimeter optical properties of cosmic analog dusts at low temperatures. A dry cryocooler will be purchased so that work on this project can continue, free from the expenses of perishable cryogens. In addition, a Fourier Transform Spectrometer, designed specifically for this work, will be constructed in PI's research lab. Once these apparati are in place, the mm/sub-mm opacity and emissivity of many dust samples, made internally or obtained from external groups will be measured, using an innovative program of study. The main goals of this work are to (A) utilize the rich set of tools and expertise developed within the observational cosmology community to measure the above properties to unprecedented accuracy, (B) analyze dust species produced by different methods and different investigators under the same experimental conditions in order to clearly understand common trends and basic difference between the samples, and (C) implement an efficient experimental scheme for analyzing a large number of dust candidates, which would naturally lead to the creation of a database on the measured properties.<br/><br/>At visible wavelengths, dust obscures many interesting astronomical environments such as molecular clouds, star forming regions, young and old stars enveloped by dust, and young ultra-luminous galaxies in the early universe. The mm/sub-mm spectral region is a good regime to study these objects because dust is more transparent at these wavelengths. Information on the nature of interstellar dust is useful in and of itself because dust is an important component in galactic and stellar evolution as well as in the complex chemistry present in space that ultimately gives rise to prebiotic molecules, and this information can reveal more about the nature the objects/environments that are obscured by dust. Recent laboratory studies have shown that the properties of dust in the mm/sub-mm spectral region is more complicated than previously thought. Therefore, detailed studies dust species that can serve as analogs for cosmic dust such as those that will be undertaken in this project are needed before astronomical data on such environments can be interpreted with any confidence. This need has been intensified recently due to the availability high-quality mm/sub-mm data from new observatories such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array."
0.303699,"AST 0307956<br/>PI Korpela<br/><br/>Since late 1998, the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI@home) project has been recording data in a 2.5 MHz band centered at 1420 MHz, sensitive to neutral hydrogen gas, at the Arecibo radio observatory. This is done during normal astronomical observations, so this ""piggyback"" observing mode does not require dedicated telescope time. The existing 35 Terabyte dataset includes observations from nearly the entire sky visible from Arecibo. Some portions of the sky have been observed 50 or more times. The dataset continues to grow at a rate of about 50 Gigabytes per day. A new data recorder, coming on line in 2003, will expand the recorded bandwidth to 100 MHz and allow multibeam observation modes. It will be used at both Arecibo and the Parkes Observatory in Australia. This project will turn this vast dataset toward astronomical purposes. Work has begun on using this data to conduct a survey of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution in the galaxy, which has been dubbed SETHI . This survey has better angular resolution than existing single dish surveys, and better sensitivity than existing or planned interferometric surveys. Another relatively unexplored area of radio parameter space is that of microsecond time scale dispersed pulses. PI Korpela and collaborators will develop a distributed computing application (called Astropulse) to examine the dataset for both single and repeated pulses of these durations. For single pulses, this will be the most sensitive survey of its kind. With this survey there is the potential of detecting emission from primordial black holes and, at the very least, it will set the best limit to date on the existence of such black holes. This survey could also detect giant pulses from unknown pulsars or detect sub-millisecond pulsars. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: These projects bring contributions to the astronomical community at a relatively low cost. Since the data exist for other purposes, the cost of instrumentation is non-existent. The techniques developed for distributed computation and storage and analysis of vast datasets will be of significant value to the astronomical community. The University of California Berkeley group has a long standing commitment to education and public outreach. The SETI@home program has already vastly increased public interest in science in general. Thousands of K-12 teachers use SETI@home in their science curriculum and SETI@home is part of the Great Exploration in Science and Mathematics (GEMS) program. Because the HI survey and Astropulse are considered to be an extension of SETI@home, these projects allow a natural path into discussion of the Galaxy and its structure, black holes, and even cosmology. The project web site will be a resource for teachers to learn and to teach about these aspects of astronomy. Students at both the graduate and undergraduate level have been involved SETHI and Astropulse. The Astropulse primary analysis code is being written by a graduate student. The Astropulse results will form a significant portion of a Ph.D. thesis."

0.03,"The conference ""The Legacy of Bernhard Riemann after One Hundred and Fifty Years"" will be held at Tsinghua Sanya International Mathematics Forum with dates December 27-30, 2015. There are only a few mathematicians in history whose work is still intensively studied after 150 years in its original form and continue to provide inspiration to generations to come. Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) is one such mathematician. In this conference, young mathematicians and students will get both deep insights and gain inspiration from Riemann's work. The event will provide a forum to discuss future directions of development of mathematics and their interaction with physics. The URL for the event website is: http://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/sanya/2015/LBR2015/synopsis_organizers.aspx<br/><br/>One only need think of concepts such as Riemann surfaces, Riemannian manifolds, the Riemann integral, and the Riemann zeta function to realize the depth and breadth of Riemann's work. Indeed, Riemann's contributions have set the foundations of entire areas of mathematics which are actively studied. Among these, Riemann's study of the geometry of space has evolved into one of the most important problems in geometry and theoretical physics: what is the geometry of space-time that can simultaneously explain the very small scale physics (quantum physics) and very large scale physics (cosmology as explained by general relativity)? The organizers expect this problem to be a major driving force of geometry and theoretical physics in this century. This conference will feature a number of distinguished speakers, including Professor Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study. The activity will put Riemann's work into proper perspective, while attracting a younger generation of mathematicians to these subjects, and providing a forum to discuss future directions of development of mathematics and their interaction with physics."
0.510241,"Abstract - McKay A large amount of recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that gravitational lensing effects afford our best opportunity to directly measure the abundance and distribution of total mass in the universe. Recent work has extended the measurement of mass distributions from the strong lensing regime of multiple quasar images and giant arcs to the weaker lensing effects seen in the periphery of massive clusters of galaxies. With the unique wide field imaging system of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), it will be possible to extend such lensing studies to very wide fields, and study density variations in the universe independent of the bias between luminous and dark matter. The weak lensing technique is the only way to directly probe large scale structures in the mass density of the universe, and the SDSS offers the only opportunity to do this over a large fraction of the sky. These methods will be used to measure the surface density of matter over one fourth of the sky, to probe the evolution of this density field using photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, to measure directly the bias between the observed local distribution of luminous matter and the underlying mass distribution, and to measure the lensing mass of nearby clusters like the Coma cluster. This is a difficult program, requiring careful control of systematic errors, but the SDSS is exceedingly well designed to meet these challenges. A complementary program would search for quasar lenses within the SDSS data for use in related studies. Data generated by the SDSS will be used both for traditional graduate and undergraduate research, and also as a tool for bringing current research into the introductory classroom. Advanced undergraduate students will be involved in designing a set of tools, using the SDSS data, to illustrate important scientific principles. These tools will be used in a ""hands-on"" cosmology class for entering non-science majors, in large standard intro ductory physics classes, and will be distributed through existing teacher outreach programs. There will be continued efforts to improve the quality of standard undergraduate teaching at the University of Michigan, and to continue SDSS public information programs and a successful public lecture series. This project is a five year program that will enable a faculty member at the University of Michigan to develop further as an astrophysics researcher and an educator. The grant will support the faculty member, a graduate student, and a number of undergraduates in their analysis of gravitational lensing effects in data to be obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. There is also support to use the SDSS data in the development of new educational materials for use in a variety of classroom situations."
0.458815,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>Generalized geometries form a class of almost complex manifolds with reduced structure groups, which have become of central importance to the study of realistic string theory models. These are natural generalizations of Calabi-Yau manifolds and are of mathematical interest in their own right. In one class important for string theory, the canonical structure one seeks on a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold is governed by a ``warp factor equation'' that couples a balanced Hermitian metric to an anti self-dual connection of a vector bundle. When the manifold is Kahler Calabi-Yau and the vector bundle is the tangent bundle, this system reduces to the Calabi conjecture for Ricci-flat metrics. The mathematical understanding of generalized geometries is still in its nascent stage. The purpose of this proposal is to develop this field further, into a full-fledged extension of Kahler Calabi-Yau geometries. We will focus on the following tightly interconnected problems: constructing new solutions to string theory in this class; characterizing the deformations and specifically the moduli of these spaces; understanding ""worldsheet instantons"" and their enumerative geometry in these manifolds; and an understanding of ""generalized calibrations,"" the analog of calibrated submanifolds of special holonomy manifolds.<br/><br/>The proposed project is to study the mathematics of a new class of geometric objects called ""generalized geometries"", and the appearance of this class in string theory. Mathematically, these structures provide interesting and natural extensions of a well-known class of geometric constructions in Calabi-Yau geometry. Physically, these extensions are known to be required to capture essential features of particle physics and cosmology, and will push string theorists closer to the goal of making contact with observations. The project is a multi-institutional and interdisciplinary effort, involving mathematicians and physicists at Brandeis, Harvard, and Texas A&M."
0.270001,"AST 0098615<br/>Vishniac<br/><br/>This project deals with the intersection of two important issues in the field of astrophysics, the generation of large scale magnetic fields, and the accretion of gas onto collapsed objects, such as black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs. There has been continuing work on the `dynamo problem' for more than 80 years. Very recently, numerical simulations have indicated that there are problems with the dynamo equations. Some simulations designed to produce strong magnetic fields have failed to do so, while others that fail to meet the basic conditions for dynamo activity show strong magnetic field generation. Meanwhile, the last thirty years has seen steady progress in our understanding of how gas collects together to form stars, or to fall into black holes. When the gas is able to radiate its energy, it tends to form a disk of ionized material that slowly spirals into the center, eventually falling onto the central object. This process is believed to lie at the heart of such diverse objects as quasars, where the central object is a supermassive black hole, and proto-stars, where the central object is a newly formed star. Crude models of this process have been successful in providing qualitative models of kinds of radiation emitted from such objects, and some of the time-varying behavior seen in dwarf novae (where the central object is a white dwarf) and soft X-ray transients (where the central object is usually a black hole, with a mass several times the mass of the Sun). Within the last ten years there has been a growing consensus that these two problems are actually closely related, and that the `friction' in accretion disks is actually due to magnetic fields that spontaneously wiggle inside the accretion disk. The behavior of accretion disks is actually closely connected to the way that they generate magnetic fields. Computer simulations indicate that the turbulent motions generated by the magnetic field actually helps generate the magnetic field.<br/><br/>This project will study the generation of large scale magnetic fields in hot accretion disks using a novel approach to dynamo theory recently developed by the PI and collaborators. The project will have three main components. First, the new dynamo theory will be extended and tested quantitatively to ensure that it provides a viable explanation for the generation of large scale magnetic fields. Second, models of accretion disks in which the detailed evolution of the magnetic field can be replaced with large scale approximate equations will be constructed. These will describe the evolution of the large scale magnetic field, and its ability to provide a source of `friction' and therefore heating within the disk. Finally, this approach will be used to study dwarf novae disks. These disks have a number of features which make them ideal for comparison with the models. In particular, they are largely unaffected by the radiation coming from the inner parts of the disk and the central object, and they show outbursts in which the properties of the disks change dramatically. They are also well-observed, so that the success, or failure, of the models will be immediately apparent.

0.22491,"AST 0205935<br/>Cohn<br/><br/>In modern cosmology, the basic building block of all cosmic structure is a halo, i.e., a condensed clump of matter. The Universe is constantly evolving, with these halos falling towards each other and merging under the influence of gravity. This theoretical project will study two aspects of these basic building blocks: <br/><br/>The first part of the project involves haloes of individual galaxies. Numerical calculations will be used to model the patterns formed when distant light sources (such as distant galaxies) have their light bent by gravity when it passes close to a second galaxy which lies between the earth and the more distant one (gravitational lensing). The halo around the intervening galaxy can be studied using this method. Since the constant merging of halos implies that haloes of nearby galaxies will contain clumps and sub-clumps, these structures can be mapped-out using gravitational lensing. The numerical calculations will identify what lensing as a tool can discern about the shape of a galaxy halo. This knowledge will then be applied to the wealth of new observational data that is available and used to determine the actual structure of nearby galaxy haloes.<br/><br/>The second part of this project focuses on major mergers of larger halos, which are associated with clusters of galaxies. Major mergers produce a severely disrupted halo. They can both create new observational signals and contaminate measurements which rely on models which assume undisturbed, idealized properties for the cluster haloes. Numerical calculations will be used to determine how often these mergers occur, how closely in space they are expected to occur and how these results depend upon the many different observational and numerical parameters which characterize a cluster halo. These numerical results will then be used to interpret observations of galaxy cluster halo lensing.<br/>***"

This project will explore the properties of these jets - the flow speeds (which are very close to the speed of light), the magnetic field, the energization of electrons, and wiggling of the nozzle - and how these depend on time, frequency, and energy output. These will provide clues needed to figure out the physical mechanisms that control the jets.

The host scientist is Professor Richard Easther.<br/><br/>Due to modern experiments such as NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck, the expansion history of the universe from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) era until today is very well understood to remarkable precision. The expansion history before BBN however is still a mystery.

Plans include the development of a phenomenological model based on pQCD to describe the experimental data and to determine whether genuine collective effects, e.g. QGP formation, are necessary to reproduce the data. If successful, genuine collective effects revealed by the data will further our understanding of strong-interaction physics. Such new knowledge is critical for the progress of high-energy nuclear physics and should contribute to astrophysics and cosmology as well.<br/><br/>This project in nuclear and particle physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence."

Norris of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories and Dr. Sean Ryan of the Anglo-Australian Observatory in Epping, Australia. The collaborative research will focus on the discovery and analysis of extremely low metallicity in the Galactic Halo. Large numbers of extremely metal-deficient stars provide crucial information on questions in cosmology, the formation and evolution of the Galaxy, and the production and processing of light elements in stars. Observations of low-metallicity candidates through the southern hemisphere sky, made possible through this collaboration, will provide a significant increase in the numbers of stars with metal abundances less than 1/1000th of the solar value, thereby enabling a wide range of investigations concerning the formation and evolution of our Galaxy, and the Universe. Specific investigations include a detailed comparison of the metallicity distribution function of extremely metal-poor stars with predictions of Galactic enrichment models, a study of the kinematics of metal-deficient stars as a function of abundance and distance from the Galactic plane, and high-resolution observations of the relative abundances of the light and heavy elements in stars, which in turn place fundamental constraints on stellar evolution and on nucleosynthesis processes in the early Universe.

One of the most outstanding problems of modern cosmology is the identification of the reionizing energy source of the universe. The simplest explanation posits that stars in first-light galaxies comprise this ionizing source. Although these stars should leave a distinctive spectral and spatial signature on the cosmic Near Infrared Background (NIRB), to date no such detection exists, primarily because of uncertainties in the modeling of light scattered off of interplanetary dust (zodiacal light). To detect this NIRB signature of the first-light galaxies, Dr. Renbarger and his colleagues will build the Cosmic Infrared Background ExploRer (CIBER). CIBER is a rocket-borne suite of four telescopes that will perform imaging and spectroscopy of the NIRB in addition to directly imaging the intensity of zodiacal light. The direct zodiacal measurement will eliminate the need to rely on modeling of the zodiacal intensity and will thus eliminate the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in cosmic NIRB measurements. Over the next three years Dr. Renbarger will direct the design, fabrication and testing of the zodiacal imaging system and lead the payload integration in the lab and the field.<br/><br/>Dr. Renbarger will also develop and annually teach an academic enrichment course designed for high school students held during the summer on the UCSD campus.

0.097514,"The project explores the geometry and topology of three-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, those which admit a Riemannian metric with negative sectional curvatures. Some of the most fundamental questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds concern the extent to which their properties are inherited in, or, conversely, may develop among covering spaces of finite degree. The famous virtual Haken and virtual fiberering conjectures answer this description, for example, as do the questions below. Given a hyperbolic 3-manifold with a special topological property, for instance a knot complement, with how many others that have this same property does it share a finite-degree cover? Or for a fixed hyperbolic 3-manifold M and a family of finite-degree covers {M_n}, does the rank of the fundamental group of M_n grow linearly with the covering degree? This relates to the fixed price question in the study of topological dynamics. The PI intends to continue his attacks on these and other questions, such as the possibility of embedding in right-angled Artin groups. He will also further describe the topology of hyperbolic manifolds with low volume.<br/><br/><br/>The objects of study here, 3-manifolds, are spaces which look, in a neighborhood of each point, like the familiar three-dimensional space in which we live. Although their definition allows quite a bit of flexibility, 3-manifolds share with 2-manifolds (surfaces) the property that each admits a unique best metric, a way of measuring the distance between two points in the space. This property of low-dimensional manifolds, known in dimension 3 as Thurston's geometrization conjecture and proven recently by V. Perelman, has motivated an enormous body of work that uses geometry as a tool for understanding 3-manifolds, and the project follows this broad theme. The study of 3-manifolds has benefited from its interaction with many different fields of mathematics, and the project additionally draws from questions and techniques in the study of topological dynamics, geometric flows, geometric group theory, and others. <br/>The project will help us better understand the classification of 3-manifolds and the relationships between them.

This will permit the system to provide a way to provide descriptive information about the data directly to the tools. The system will be formalized to prove the correctness of the tools. The research combines novel programming language design, high-performance system engineering and theoretical analysis to solve crucial data processing problems. The system will be tested to address real problems such as fraud detection and in the context of genomic pathway modeling, as well as in cosmology data.

The researchers intend to examine what canonical quantum gravity can reveal about gravitational collapse. The goal is to go beyond semiclassical approximations and gain some insights about the effects induced by quantum geometry in one of the most puzzling processes predicted by general relativity and quantum theory: the formation of a black hole by gravitational collapse and its evaporation by Hawking radiation. Prof. Kuchar's research at the University of Utah involves both astrophysical/computational work and research related to the mathematical foundations of relativity and quantization. The Mexican group is large and multidisciplinary, covering quantum gravity, relativistic astrophysics, classical cosmology, variational principles, black hole physics, and geometric approaches to various branches of physics. The complementary expertise of the researchers forms the basis for the intended collaboration. ***"

0.032395,"9352030 Barker As Robert Ballard (the discoverer of the Titanic) has said, ""Science is a contact sport,"" but it was not until recently that the technology has become available to give introductory students a genuine exposure to the ""contact sport"" of astronomy. In Step 1 of the program, students in all introductory courses (including those without laboratories) use Macintosh microcomputers running the Voyager planetarium program to control 10"" telescopes to observe objects independently of the instructor. Although they are asked to observe a common core of objects that are central to the course they are taking, they also study objects that they select themselves and so are introduced to both the excitement and frustration of the contact sport of astronomy. In Step 2, students taking the laboratory Cosmology course build on this experience by using CCD cameras attached to the telescopes and interfaced to the microcomputers to do imaging and photometry. By the end of the course, they can be experienced enough to carry out two-week self-designed research projects such as monitoring variable stars and looking for supernovae and so are active participants in the contact sport of astronomy. In Step 3, students taking Observational Astronomy carry out extensive self-designed research projects such as determining light curves of supernovae, doing photometry of fast-moving asteroidal objects, monitoring active galaxies, and observing variable stars. In Step 4, students in upper-level courses continue with these projects, some of which will be publishable. In Step 5, Astronomy majors and minors doing Individual Research are able to do much more sophisticated theses than was previously possible. Equipment tests and a successful pilot program have been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of much of this project. This is the first project to use Voyager to control a computerized telescope, a technology that has s ignificant potential for astronomy education nationally. ***"
0.057154,"Symmetry is utilized as a fundamental paradigm in a multidisciplinary course whose purpose is to guide humanities students to both comprehend and become excited about the scientific world. Through sensory-rich examples of symmetry in a domain they know, these students are then stimulated to journey across this bridge into the realm of science.The course begins by illustrating pleasing patterns in the sciences and in the arts; this leads to a general definition of symmetry. We then characterize symmetry using elementary mathematical notions. Next we go on to see examples of symmetry in art and in mathematics as well as in poetry and in music. Then we display the existence of symmetry in physics, chemistry, biology, and cosmology. A brief excursion into asymmetry ends the course.Students are able to explicitly develop their quantitative abilities and analogical thinking by using concepts of symmetry both as a method within a discipline and as a bridge between disciplines. They develop these abilities, in part, through the medium of a highly graphical laboratory experience that utilizes computers for understanding many facets of symmetry and for generating their own patterns through the use of exploratory-based software packages. Written and oral communication are emphasized through classroom discussions, exams, laboratory discussions and reports, and through a term project. The multimedia course is taught in an assembled lecture-discussion setting, and the labs are an opportunity for students to engage in collaborative learning. A term project requires each student to choose a topic from one of the science-based categories discussed in the course. Every student will submit an essay explaining his or her project as well as demonstrating the project to the class. Occasional guest lectures and a trip to a science museum are planned to promote further enjoyment of the course."

0.165,"Direct detection of gravitational waves has been a major challenge in gravity and astrophysics research for nearly 50 years. Successful detection of gravitational waves is expected to provide insight and information on neutron stars, supernova explosions, black holes, and the earliest moments after the Big Bang that is not available to electromagnetic telescopes. It will also provide an experimental test of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which can help determine if there are missing elements to our understanding of gravity and cosmology. The detection of astronomical gravitational waves requires extremely precise optical measurements. Coating thermal noise in the optics is a limiting noise source in the most sensitive frequency band of second generation gravitational wave detectors. This project is on the study and improvement of coating thermal noise through novel measurements of the mechanical loss in optical coating materials. Measuring two sources of dissipation (from bulk and torsional motion) in coating materials can give valuable information for low thermal noise coating design as well as insights into the causes of thermal noise in coating materials.<br/><br/>Improvements in coating thermal noise will have applications beyond gravitational wave detection. Frequency stabilization, quantum mechanics experiments, and other precision optics applications are encountering the same coating thermal noise limitation as gravitational wave detection. Some of these have commercial and industrial applications, especially frequency stabilization and precision timing. In addition, this proposal helps to develop an experimental physics program at American University that will include undergraduate researchers. This will help expose American students (many of whom aspire to careers in public policy) to experimental science and cutting edge research."

0.1,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Vadim Kaplunovsky at the University of Texas at Austin. His work focuses on several aspects of string theory -- which unifies gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature (strong, weak, and electromagnetic). String theory has an unusual property - it contains something called ""holographic dualities"", which relate theories in many-body quantum systems (ranging from quark-gluon plasma to superconductors) to theories of gravity in higher dimensional spaces. These dualities, since they relate to very different systems, allow calculations in one system to give results in the other. Professor Kaplunovsky studies the duality between forms of super-dense nuclear matter and models with crystal-like structures, as well as the duality between models of gravity in highly curved spaces with strongly interacting particle physics models. He also studies string theories which are dual to each other. All these projects are deeply connected to other aspects of string theory as well as to particle physics, nuclear physics, and condensed matter. To enhance the broader impact of his research, Professor Kaplunovsky will give a series of talks to high-school students about hot issues of modern physics (which alas are not even mentioned in a regular curriculum). The subjects may involve fundamental particles, cosmology, or anything else the students may be interested in. Prof. Kaplunovsky will also give a series of more advanced lectures about theoretical physics to the undergraduate students at the University of Texas and at other universities in the US and overseas.<br/><br/>Prof. Kaplunovsky's research focuses on several issues of string theory and holographic QCD. One project is about infinite crystals of YM instantons -- which 'live' in 4+1 dimensions (where they act as particles) but may form lower-dimensional lattices in external potentials. There are many types of such crystals, with different lattice geometries and/or different patterns of instantons' isospin orientations. The project focuses on surveying such crystals and the phase transitions between them, especially the transitions which change the dimensionality of the lattice (3D->4D, or 2D->3D, or 1D->2D). Another project focuses on leading order (in alpha') stringy corrections to the hadron spectra in high-curvature holographic QCD models with O(1) 't Hooft couplings. A related issue concerns stringy corrections to the short-distance nuclear forces in models where the dual baryons looks like string stars rather than instantons. The third project is about M theory duals of the heterotic orbifolds, which seem to give paradoxical results, and he hopes to come up with a solution to these puzzles."
6.73285,"AST 0618398<br/>Lee<br/><br/>Observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization are a powerful probe of cosmology and will eventually probe the standard model of physics at ultrahigh energy. With this award, Dr. Adrian Lee, University of California at Berkeley, will lead a new project called POLARBEAR (POLARization of the Background Radiation) which will use a dedicated telescope equipped with a powerful 1,200-bolometer array receiver to produce maps of CMB polarization with unprecedented accuracy. The most exciting possibility is that POLARBEAR will detect the signature of gravitational waves from the end of the inflationary period, 10-38 seconds after the Big Bang. If detected, these signals will provide an independent verification of the inflationary paradigm and test specific models for inflation. <br/><br/>Another important scientific motivation is to characterize the gravitational lensing of the CMB<br/>polarization. An accurate lensing measurement will yield constraints on Dark Energy. POLARBEAR can verify, or rule out, models with a strongly time-dependent Dark Energy equation of state w. In fact, POLARBEAR can provide information on w"", the time derivative of w, which is comparable and complementary to that from a space-based supernovae search. The lensing signal is also sensitive to neutrino masses because massive neutrinos act as ""hot"" dark matter changing the formation of the lensing large scale structure. <br/><br/>POLARBEAR introduces unprecedented levels of instrumental sensitivity and control of systematic<br/>errors. The high sensitivity is achieved with an array of planar-antenna-coupled Transition-Edge<br/>Sensor (TES) bolometers operated at 250 mK.

0.033,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose presence we only infer gravitationally, is unknown in its nature, and is termed dark matter. Particle physics suggests that dark matter comprises relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds. The motion of the Earth through the galaxy produces a head-wind of WIMPs. The angular distribution of recoils from WIMP interactions has a ~100% asymmetry, and is modulated at the sidereal rate on account of the Earth's rotation. No known background can mimic this signal. <br/><br/>The practical implications of the technology being developed for such searches have promising applications to low background alpha and neutron measurements. This work also includes the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience.<br/><br/>The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment leads the field of directional dark matter detection. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's sensitivity to this modulated signature, which provides a unique window into one of the most important questions in science today. NSF-funded DRIFT-IId work over the last several years has led to enormous experimental progress. The collaboration is in the final stages of commissioning a new DRIFT-IIe detector.

The BELR line strengths also reflect directly the rate of dynamical evolution in the center of the host galaxy. The brightness of these lines means they can be measured precisely even out to quite large redshifts, but they have been hard to interpret. The PI will further check the interpretation methods he has been developing for some years, and will run numerical experiments to determine the best lines to use and to calibrate the use of iron abundances as a chronometer, as well as to understand the true uncertainties in the derived properties of BELRs. Armed with those results, optimized observations will obtain high quality spectra of a carefully selected sample, and derive parameters that can directly reveal early evolution at the centers of massive galaxies.<br/><br/>The PI will set up a strong public outreach program through the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State, using a flashy, continuously running presentation with this research as a background, to inform the thousands of annual visitors about cosmology, the birth of galaxies, and the origin of the chemical elements.

0.21,"AST 0098705<br/>Baring<br/><br/>Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most fascinating objects known in the universe, possessing a uniqueness embodied in their ephemeral nature. Their discovery around 30 years ago has led to a sequence of baffling mysteries and startling revelations. The latest advance among these was the discovery in 1997 of fading X-ray, optical and radio afterglows that have permitted accurate determination of their distance from Earth, placing them in the most remote realms of the universe. Consequently, astrophysicists have arrived at the conclusion that GRBs are the most luminous and powerful objects in the universe. Current thinking is that they are spawned by a catastrophic event, perhaps an explosion of a massive star. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to investigate catastrophic event models of GRBs. In these models, the GRB occurs when the ejected material from the star ploughs into the surrounding ambient gas at highly supersonic and relativistic speeds, creating an enormously powerful cosmic shock wave. Energy is liberated, both in thermal forms and in the form of extremely relativistic elementary particles. These high-speed particles then produce radiative emission, which is detected on Earth as gamma rays, X-rays, radio waves and optical light. The uncertainties in this dissipative shock scenario essentially stem from two constraints: (i) the relatively short duration and narrow energy bandwidth of the prompt gama-ray data, and (ii) the present crudeness of theoretical models. This project addresses these limitations. It explores how the relativistic particles can obtain the necessary extreme energies. It includes much more accurate determinations than previously available of the maximum energies attainable. It also seeks to establish definitive correlations and trends between particle acceleration properties and the radiation we see, using the latter as a diagnostic probe on the acceleration physics. The big questions this work seeks to answer include (i) whether the GRB environment is an ordered large scale phenomenon, or whether it possesses a multitude of chaotic, entangled, magnetized cells, (ii) if both of these situations can arise and thereby effect an explanation of the observational possibility that there might be two classes of bursts, not just one, (iii) how large the mean magnetic field is in a GRB, and (iv) whether particle acceleration in bursts is sufficiently rapid to account for the pervasive population of ultrarelativistic nuclei (cosmic rays) that shower Earth incessantly. This connection between the astrophysical environment of gamma-ray bursts and the underlying physics has not been studied before. In addition, this work will also address models for active galaxies, since their emission is probably driven by similar types of physics. Success in these goals will provide a suitable platform for further advancement of our knowledge of the exotic and alluring gamma-ray burst sources over the coming decades.

0.191558,"Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. DAMA at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy is the only experiment claiming a discovery of dark matter interactions from their observation of a predicted annual modulation of the signal rate. Recent results from some experiments (CoGeNT, CRESST, and CDMS-Si) may support the light WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) interpretation, while others do not (KIMS-CsI, LUX, and XENON-100, among others). Only an experiment using NaI(Tl) can perform a model-independent test. The SABRE (Sodium-iodide with Active Background REjection) experiment would shed light on this debate and thus direct future direct-detection searches.<br/><br/>The SABRE project provides ample opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to gain experience and training for careers in the scientific community.

Their partnerships with industry enable the development of new technologies, products, and measurement techniques that will be made available to the research and industrial market at large. <br/><br/>The SABRE R&D effort, funded by this award, aims to provide a proof-of-principle for such a detector by developing NaI(Tl) detectors with lower backgrounds and a lower energy threshold than DAMA.

Jamil Ragep (University of Oklahoma) <br/>""An Edition, Translation, and Commentary of Two Medieval Persian Astronomical Texts""<br/><br/><br/>One of the more interesting genres of medieval Islamic scientific literature is a type of theoretical<br/>astronomical work known as hay'a, whose primary purpose was to provide a summary, usually without computational details, of Ptolemaic astronomy. The more elementary hay 'a works became an important vehicle for establishing a widely accepted rational, scientific cosmology in premodern times. (This latter point is especially important when we attempt to assess the relationship of science and religion in Islam.) In its more advanced forms, this genre, which thrived in Islam for well over 800-years, provided a locus for criticisms of Ptolemy, detailed discussions of mathematical models and their relations to physics, and alternative, non-Ptolemaic astronomical models. These models almost certainly influenced a number of early modern European scientists including Copernicus, and the genre itself was instrumental in the development of an analogous astronomical tradition (theorica) in Europe.<br/><br/>This grant supports the completion of an edition, translation, and commentary of two representatives of this tradition, namely the Risalah-i Muniyya and its ""appendix,"" the Hall-i Mushkilat-i Muiniyya, both written by the Persian polymath Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201-1274 A.D.). They are particularly significant since in them Tusi first announced and presented his new devices (the Tusi couples) and non-Ptolemaic planetary models, which modern scholars had previously thought were associated with the later Maragha observatory of the Mongols. These treatises also provide insight into the Persian court culture that patronized Tusi at the time. Preliminary editions and translations of both texts, which are in medieval Persian, were completed some years ago by Professors Jamil Ragep of the University of Oklahoma and Wheeler Thackston of Harvard University. This grant provides the support required to allow the PI to collate the preliminary editions with eight additional manuscripts that he recently obtained from Middle Eastern and European libraries, and to enable him to continue to support three assistants (two of whom are native speakers of Persian) who have long contributed to his scholarship."
0.908,"In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose effect we can see only gravitationally, is unknown in its nature and is termed Dark Matter. Particle physics models suggest that dark matter is composed of relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are challenging due to the predicted small interaction probabilities and the existence of large backgrounds that mimic the expected signal. However, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions. The largest and most robust signature is the predicted dependence of the WIMP flux on the Sun-Earth velocity through the galaxy, yielding a day-night modulation of the nuclear recoil direction in the laboratory. Of current searches with directional detectors, the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment is a leader, having a decade of experience. The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFT's unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today. <br/><br/>These advances in background rejection, combined with the fact that further limit setting capabilities are hampered by the small volume of DRIFT-II, suggest that DRIFT should scale-up. This award will enable the collaboration to continue running DRIFT-II in the Boulby mine in England. In addition to running DRIFT-IId, these funds will provide hardware for a second detector, DRIFT-IIe.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students (including underrepresented minorities) in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of hardware and software experience. Finally, the DRIFT detector technology has promising applications to Homeland Security and double-beta decay experiments."
0.424634,"The proposer will study problems in scattering theory and several non-linear inverse problems that can be formulated as boundary and lens rigidity questions and related tensor tomography inverse problems. Boundary and lens rigidity for compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary are inverse problems where one wants to recover the manifold from the distance (travel times)between each two boundary points, or the scattering relation on the boundary. A linearization of these problems is the integral geometry problem of recovering of a tensor field from integrals along maximal geodesics. The proposer will study this type of questions for various systems: Riemannian manifolds, asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, Lorentzian manifolds, and non-metric Hamiltonians. The case of caustics will be studied carefully. The motivation to study those problems comes both from pure mathematics: rigidity questions in geometry, inverse scattering, inverse boundary value problems for hyperbolic equations, math theory of relativity, integral geometry of tensors; as well from applications to geophysics, medical imaging, oil exploration, non-destructive testing, cosmology and conformal field theory, etc. The proposer will study stable ways to recover the parameters of the system (the metric, the Hamiltonian, etc.). One of goals of this project in the scattering theory part is to study the asymptotic distribution of resonances and it relation to the classical mechanical behavior of the system.<br/><br/>The Inverse Problems that will be studied in this project serve as mathematical models in many practical situations: in medicine for imaging the internal structure of a human body (CT, ultrasound, thermoacoustic tomography); in non-destructive material testing; in geophysics for obtaining information about the inner structure of the earth from travel times of seismic waves, or from travel times of reflected acoustic waves; in oil exploration; in theory of relativity, theoretical physics, etc. Riemannian metrics model anisotropic media, where the speed of wave propagation may depend not only on the position but also on the direction and this project's emphasis is on the study of anisotropic media. Anisotropy naturally occurs in Earth, in the human body, etc. The proposed research will develop further the mathematical tools of travel time tomography, and will analyze the stability in various situations. The theory of resonances, as a part of scattering theory, is of fundamental importance for quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry. Resonances can be observed as certain peak frequencies and one of the objectives of this research is to relate them to the properties of the system."
0.153,"This proposal supports the research in algebraic geometry of Professor Uli Walther of Purdue University. The main focus of this proposal is the study of singularities. To a singularity (defined by the vanishing of a set of polynomials) one may attach several invariants; these may be of discrete type (such as the number of branches of a curve meeting in a point) or of continuous nature (such as the space of all vector fields tangent to the singularity). If one considers a family of singularities, such invariants behave in interesting ways: on one side, at special members of the family they ""jump"" (i.e., get larger in some sense), while on the other side, near typical members of the family, they deform according to so-called ""hypergeometric""<br/>differential equations. One component of this project investigates, using homological and combinatorial methods, jumps and solutions of the hypergeometric differential equations. The other part of the proposal is concerned with the study of specific invariants of singularities derived through either calculus (the Gauss--Manin connection and Bernstein--Sato polynomial), counting techniques (the Igusa zeta function), or deformations (cohomology of the Milnor fiber), and their interplay.<br/><br/>This research falls into the broad category of algebraic geometry, one of the most variegated areas of today's mathematics. Fundamentally, algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects described by algebraic data through artful manipulation of the input data using an incredibly wide array of mathematical tools. Because of its diversity, algebraic geometry permeates such different branches of science as robotics, cosmology, and computer encryption. The origins of algebraic geometry can be traced to the works of Euclid and Pythagoras. In its modern form, the focus of algebraic geometry is on singularities. These include cusps, foldings, and self-intersections, and are generally comprised of points that are unusual when compared to their neighbors."
0.448377,"Many stars form in large clusters containing anywhere from thousands to many millions of objects. Stars in these clusters are born with a broad range of masses. Furthermore, the most massive stars evolve quickly, ending their lives in just a few million years and leaving behind black holes as remnants. The star clusters themselves, however, can continue to live for many billions of years, and indeed the globular clusters seen in many galaxies are thought to contain some of the oldest stars in the Universe. Therefore, many of the star clusters we see today should contain large numbers of black holes formed a long time ago. This research will use state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations to study the formation and evolution of these black holes in a variety of star cluster environments. It will also leverage innovative hybrid computational techniques, including General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU).<br/><br/>The study of black hole formation and evolution is important in many areas of physics and&#8232;astronomy, including galaxy formation and cosmology, the study of quasars and other active&#8232;galactic nuclei, general relativity and gravitational wave astronomy. The stellar dynamics supercomputer codes to be developed for this project are general tools, which will be useful&#8232;for studying many other problems involving dense star clusters with or without massive black&#8232;holes. The planned research activities will involve the training of undergraduate students at Northwestern University, and will likely include students from under-represented minorities.

0.179904,"Almost every geophysical process leaves it signature in the terrestrial gravity field or its changes. If the process is ""big'' enough, it can be measured by GRACE, a twin satellite mission that is sensitive to the Earth's time-variable gravity field, which has been yielding data for about seven years now. Among its many other accomplishments, models based on GRACE have provided evidence that the Earth's polar regions are losing mass due to progressive melting of their ice cover, and GRACE modeling has also helped constrain crustal deformation resulting from large earthquakes, thereby inaugurating an era of a new class of earthquake observations. The GRACE data are noisy and require extensive processing, filtering, and statistical analysis to yield signals of this kind, which are buried deeply beneath the noise and contaminated by the geophysical signatures of ocean currents, the hydrological cycle, or post-glacial rebound. <br/><br/>Our methods development will enable us, and the scientific community, to make the most of today's available GRACE data. Well-constrained mass flux rates from Earth's polar regions, and their errors, and the robust detection, analysis and modeling of the coseismic deformation from large earthquakes will stand alone as scientific results, but they will also feed back into climate research, glaciology, seismology, and geodesy. Even more broadly than that, the problems we solve are relevant in providing new estimation methods for noisy and incomplete data distributed on a sphere, in the most general sense, e.g. as used in biomedical and statistical research, in physics, cosmology and computer science.<br/><br/>We develop a new mathematical technique for the inversion of GRACE data, which are noisy and incomplete. Central to this effort is the development of ""noise-cognizant Slepian functions'', a function basis, alternative to spherical harmonics, that is eminently suited to represent and analyze geographically localized, bandlimited, signals on the sphere. No longer producing only spatial averages of the signal, nor reprocessing global models based on spherical harmonics, we perform inversions on time series of the inter-satellite potential difference derived from GRACE, directly in this basis. From this we recover estimates of the entire spatial dependence of the mass gain/loss in ice-covered regions and hydrological basins, as well as estimates of the gravity perturbations accompanying large earthquakes. The former are important to science and society per se, the latter add information on a different temporal and spatial scale to that which can be had from GPS measurements or seismological data.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Geophysics, Arctic Natural Sciences, and Antarctic Earth Sciences Programs."
0.351747,"In this project scientists will search for new, very weak forces between atoms. The current understanding of physics and cosmology allows for the possibility that in addition to the four known fundamental forces there may be additional weak forces due to the existence of new particles. To search for such forces the group supported by the present grant will perform very sensitive experiments on atoms using a variant of the technique that underlies MRI medical scanners (nuclear magnetic resonance). In the proposed experiments the group will orient the nuclear spins of atoms using lasers and watch how the spin orientation changes with time. They expect to improve the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude compared with earlier experiments. In addition to allowing the scientists to search for new forces between atoms, the proposed experiments will also have practical applications for very sensitive measurements of magnetic fields and for precision navigation.<br/><br/>The proposal describes a program of precision measurements based on high-sensitivity nuclear spin magnetometers. In one part of the program an existing alkali-metal noble-gas co-magnetometer will be used to set new limits on several hypothetical spin interactions. A possible interaction between spin and mass can be mediated by axions or other light pseudo-scalar particles. However, existing laboratory experiments searching for this effect have not yet reached a sensitivity that is competitive with astrophysical limits. One of the proposed experiments will improve these limits by more than 3 orders of magnitude and reach, for the first time, an unexplored range of parameter space. Another type of interaction that can be mediated by hypothetical light particles is a non-magnetic spin-spin interaction. Recent limits on such electron spin interactions can be improved by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude using already existing experimental apparatus. Another part of the program is focused on development of a new type of spin co-magnetometer, using two noble gas nuclear spin species and an alkali-metal readout with a Ramsey pulse interrogation. It is designed to have a higher accuracy as well as better precision compared with existing approaches. The sensitivity of the new co-magnetometer is already sufficient to realize a search for spin-gravity interaction with energy sensitivity at the Planck scale. The group's efforts will focus on the control of systematic effects in this experiment."
0.12,"PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0801708<br/>INSTITUTION: University of Colorado Denver<br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Huber, Martin E.<br/><br/>TITLE: Superconducting Electronics Readout Systems for WIMP Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments (CDMS)<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Astronomical observations tell us that approximately 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If so, then the presence of WIMPs in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low-temperature phonon-mediated devices to search for the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from background interactions. <br/><br/>This award provides support for the UCD group that, in conjunction with the initial SuperCDMS project grants, will enable (a) the completion of the CDMSII experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the Soudan Mine, (b) the testing and underground operation at Soudan of two new ?SuperTowers,? each comprised of six next-generation detectors and (c) a modest effort of long-range research and development to develop and test new hardware and detectors for possible followup experiments. Specifically, this proposal will support the PI's activities in the CDMS projects as well as the group's long-term development and implementation of a two-stage superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) pre-amplifier phonon-readout system and development of a SQUID-based ionization-readout system for future detector technology. <br/><br/>As part of the Broader Impacts of this program, the technical development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, which have increasing utility in astrophysics, from optical astronomy to x-rays and cosmic microwave backgrounds studies, as well as other branches of physics such as quantum computing."
0.294,"Laser Pump Noise Effects on the Stability of Optical Clockworks<br/><br/>0622235<br/>Dr. Brian Kolner, UC Davis<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The recent invention of f-2f self-referencing modelocked laser clockworks has heralded a new era in precision time and frequency metrology. In spite of phenomenal advances, there are still unanswered questions about the fundamental performance limits which might be expected from these clocks. This project will investigate an important component of laser clock performance; that of laser amplitude and phase fluctuations induced by noise in the pump source. The coupling mechanisms to be studied include perturbations to the: 1) complex susceptibility through the energy level populations, 2) length of the gain medium (thermal), 3) index of refraction (direct thermal), 4) index due to thermally-induced stress, 5) photon number, and 6) nonlinear index (Kerr-effect). These mechanisms combine to degrade the performance of the laser when the pump contains random noise. By inducing small-signal modulations on the pump beam, the magnitude of these effects will be measured and compared with theory. They will then be used to predict the ultimate performance of modelocked laser clocks and provide guidance toward better clock designs. Finally, f-2f interferometer control loops will be installed on two separate lasers to compare the closed-loop performance against predictions from theory. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Precision time and frequency standards form the very foundation of navigation, commerce, telecommunications and many branches of science and technology. Improved clock precision will affect all aspects of human life. It will be especially significant in pushing the frontiers of fundamental science as we explore atoms and molecules with ever-higher precision, test whether or not the ``constants of nature'' are truly constant and improve our theories of cosmology. The results of this work will be incorporated into classroom lectures in the Optical Science and Engineering program at UC Davis and will also attract the attention of students outside of the program who are naturally fascinated by the fundamental limits of technology and how they advance basic science."

1.181707,"This project involves the study of nuclear reactions utilizing beams of short-lived radioactive nuclei, together with the development of instrumentation and techniques to facilitate these investigations. Specific experiments will emphasize the study of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability. Several of these weakly bound systems have been shown to develop an exotic ""nuclear halo"" structure, leading to an effective nuclear size that is much larger than expected based on the properties of more normal systems. Our interest is in the effect that this structure has on nuclear reactions induced by ""halo"" nuclei."" The development of deuterated-scintillator neutron detectors for this project may have applications to national-security programs. In addition, we plan to use specific nuclear reactions to probe the structure of nuclei that are important for the understanding of neutrinoless double beta decay. Several massive and expensive experiments are underway to search for this exotic decay mode, which would represent physics beyond the so-called standard model of particle interactions. If observed, this decay mode would also present a means to directly measure the mass of the neutrino, which is important for subjects such as high-energy physics, astronomy, and cosmology. However, this application requires much-improved knowledge of the structure of the nuclei involved in the beta-decay process. The experiments we are planning to carry out will contribute to the development of this understanding.<br/><br/>In addition to the already-mentioned contributions of instrumentation development to national-security issues, the broader impact of this project extends to the development of a scientifically-literate workforce via the involvement of students at the graduate, undergraduate, and high-school levels in world-class scientific research. These groups are afforded opportunities for hands-on training in nuclear accelerators, superconducting ion-optical systems, radiation detection, and other technologies. The undergraduate students come from Notre Dame and the University of Michigan, and also from several primarily-undergraduate universities and colleges in the Midwest. The high-school program includes public lectures and other outreach activities designed to highlight nuclear science and its applications to other fields such as archaeology and medicine. Finally, the program has an international component involving close collaborations with physicists in Mexico and Brazil, and new collaborations including the UK, France, and Italy are proposed."
0.093017,"Objectives. What religious goals did Charlemagne (ruled 768-814) hope to achieve by supporting<br/>a revival of scientific knowledge at the beginning of the ninth century? How were royal political<br/>legitimacy and science related in Charlemagne's striving for greater order in his kingdom and<br/>empire? In what ways did royal court culture and the education of clerics intersect and promote<br/>the sciences? Intellectual Merit In answering these questions the project will present Charlemagne's case for ordering a reform of Christian knowledge as part of a broad renewal of the religious culture in his<br/>realm. This religious renewal included the vision of Charlemagne and his dynasty as divinely<br/>chosen to direct the ordering of Christian Europe and improve Christian education within it. The<br/>king assembled from Italy, England, Ireland, and elsewhere scholars with extensive knowledge to<br/>his court. The court itself emerged as a source and a point of dissemination for revived or<br/>rediscovered literary texts and scientific knowledge along with fuller exploration of writings by<br/>the church Fathers and more recent Christian authors. Using the advice of various scholars, both<br/>secular and clerical, the king oversaw doctrinal reform, ordered attention to specific areas of<br/>study in the education of clerics, and stimulated the interest of ecclesiastical leaders in a renewal<br/>and expansion of the liberal arts as an essential foundation for biblical and doctrinal<br/>understanding. The project will show how certain of these leaders pursued a distinctive<br/>interpretation of Saint Augustine's view of secular scientific knowledge in order to justify an<br/>extensive revival and teaching of classical Roman texts (and some translated Greek texts) on<br/>astronomy, cosmology, medicine, agriculture, mathematics, and military science among others.<br/>The nature of these texts, illustrations from their pages, the ways they were studied in the<br/>Carolingian renaissance of the ninth century all these will be exposed. The search for and<br/>discovery of order in the heavens, the weather, human physiology, the structure of the cosmos,<br/>and the behaviors of animals contributed to a greater sense of confidence in the direction and<br/>order of the church and kingdom. At the same time, such confidence always required renewal<br/>through analyses of new phenomena and newly revealed knowledge. The project will show how a<br/>succession of clerics from Charlemagne forward interacted with the royal court and royal<br/>patronage to support increasingly more sophisticated scientific study and the teaching of natural<br/>science. These were seen to strengthen the church and Christian culture and thereby to benefit the<br/>king, acting in accord with the will of God.<br/>Methods. Historical methods, reading and translating medieval Latin manuscripts, engaging and<br/>applying current scholarship on the era of Charlemagne, will allow the PI to offer new<br/>understandings of the place of science in the vastly different world of ninth-century northern<br/>Europe. Description and analysis of the political and religious situations will use official<br/>documents, letter collections, religious treatises, and scientific texts to expose the particulars of<br/>scientific revival. These sources also reveal goals and strategies of ecclesiastical advisors and<br/>power figures, interacting with the royal court and with each other in regard to the sciences.<br/>Intellectual merit. The history of scientific knowledge in ninth-century Europe has moved from<br/>the study of computus (calendar-making and computation) to astronomy and to medicine and<br/>beyond. The present project will for the first time bring together a broad range of sciences and<br/>explore more deeply the religious background behind the Carolingian profusion of scientific<br/>studies, including the sense of connection between good kingship and the reform of religious and<br/>secular studies in schools. This picture of a Christian revival of science will show the reasons<br/>specific to ninth-century politics and religion for such a renewal and advancement.<br/>Broader impacts. The project will show the importance of historical conditions for different<br/>relationships among science, religion, and politics. The publication of an accessible historical<br/>narrative in book form will engage public interest. Both the limits and opportunities, historically<br/>conditioned, of political and religious involvement in science will be set out and discussed."

0.126,"The ultimate goal of this collaborative research is to measure the relative spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. A second, more remote goal is to measure the relative effects of gravity on hydrogen and antihydrogen. Positive results from either measurement would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. This proposal is focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding the trapping of antihydrogen. These issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: how to confine positrons, antiprotons in an octupole at sufficiently cold temperatures; how do leptons interact with the background radiation field; how do antiproton-antiproton collisions relax nonthermal distributions; how to mix positrons and antiprotons so that the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap; how do zerofrequency bounce resonances cause antiproton loss when the confining potentials are changed, and; how to predict the energy and state of the resultant antihydrogen under various mixing schemes. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics.<br/><br/>The long-term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The proposed research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups in the physical sciences."
0.0416,"This project is the organization of a major conference to inform, inspire, and motivate teachers of undergraduate physics to develop and use astronomy based materials for their teaching and thereby invigorate and enrich the undergraduate physics syllabus.

One of the aims is to inspire participants to produce high-quality materials for teaching in undergraduate physics courses.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>Achievement of the goals will bring before students the longstanding interrelationship of physics and astronomy. By developing the physics that underlies the discoveries and technologies of astronomy and astrophysics, physics professors will help students better understand the basic principles of physics. Students will also see how astronomy brings into view potentially new physics such as dark matter and dark energy. Second, there is now a grand generally accepted vision of the universe and its ongoing development. All students should know this vision, and physics students should know the physics that justifies it. This conference will suggest to physics professors new ways to convey the vision in their courses. Third, the discoveries of astronomy and space science depend on technologies that have grown out of basic research in physics. Such research synergies are not unique to astronomy, but astronomy provides a number of cases that clearly show how research discoveries lead to advances in science and also to applications useful to the broader society. Illustrating connections between basic research and practical consequences is an intellectually valuable part of science teaching. This conference will show the participants teachable examples of these connections. <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>There is potentially a broad impact from the formation of a cadre of physics educators -- a cadre that will include underrepresented minority faculty, women, post-docs, and graduate students -- who will seek to generate a wide range of new teaching materials and to bring new content into the undergraduate physics syllabus. Such a remarkable change can lead to the education of more people who understand the reasoning that supports our current view of the universe, and if these people become a source of information and rational argument for the larger part of the population who accept modern cosmology on authority, the result can be to give modern science a credibility with broad social impact."

0.079228,"Abstract - Gonthier AST 9876670<br/><br/>The recent observations of soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars furnish data for greater evidence of the existence of a class of neutron stars with surface magnetic fields exceeding the critical field of 4.4 ten thousand billion Gauss. This research effort seeks to understand the role of strong-field, quantum electrodynamic (QED) processes such as Compton scattering, pair production, photon splitting, and cyclotron and synchrotron radiation in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this study, an acceleration model of electrons and positrons will be developed to provide a self-consistent description of the input parameters to a Monte Carlo cascade model that simulates the emission of X-rays and gamma rays from the magnetosphere. The main effort will be to study the role of relativistic Compton scattering as it operates with other QED processes, to develop approximate expressions of the exact QED scattering cross section and incorporate them in a full acceleration-cascade model. Previous studies have assumed that Compton scattering can be adequately described by the non-relativistic Compton scattering cross section (Thomson limit) below resonance and at the resonance, or the Klein-Nishina cross section for scattering above the resonance. Consequently, these studies have not included the effects of the strong magnetic fields. Since these processes are highly dependent upon the polarization of the interacting photons, polarized differential rates for each QED process will be investigated. Pulse profiles as well as phase dependent spectra of the soft gamma-ray repeaters, anomalous X-ray pulsars, the high field gamma-ray pulsars, PSR 1509-58 and PSR 0656+14, along with the Crab, Vela and Geminga pulsars will be simulated and compared with those observed by the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO), the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA). The calculated thermal X-ray emission from polar cap heating by pair-created positrons returning to the surface will be compared with the observations of Roentgen Satellite (ROSAT) and upcoming measurements from the Chandra X-ray Observatory that is scheduled to be launched in 1999. The study of the strong field effects on the inverse Compton scattering process will provide insight into the particle-photon interactions associated with a variety of pulsar phenomena, including burst spectra of soft gamma-ray repeaters and the transport of thermal radiation through neutron star atmospheres."

The method of work will be to develop applications and environments locally on this machine, and perform production simulations and scalibility studies on larger machines at NSF supercomputer centers. Local, dedicated access to the equipment is clearly critical to all aspects of the research."
0.090291,"AST-0406713<br/>Gott<br/><br/>This project will make definitive measurements of the topology of large-scale structure in the Universe, using ground-based and space-based data to provide important tests of inflation and galaxy formation models. Results from smaller samples are consistent with the random phase distribution expected from inflation. However, small but measurable deviations are expected due to nonlinear galaxy formation processes, and a much larger sample should yield precise constraints on these effects. Topology statistics will be used to test models for galaxy biasing. The research team will use the powerful combination of new data, innovative statistical techniques, and high-resolution simulations to address fundamental questions about both cosmology and galaxy formation. This project will include the development of material for public education, and will foster research by women, international collaboration, and outreach to planetaria. The lead investigator is very committed to promoting teaching, training and education, and the maps from this work may provide the most exciting visualizations of important surveys."

0.300739,"High-energy gamma rays are used to study the most extreme objects in the Universe, such as pulsars, black holes at the center of active galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts. Cosmic gamma rays can also be signatures for new physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. Detection of gamma rays is difficult, however, because they are absorbed by the atmosphere. At the low end of the gamma-ray spectrum, the flux of gamma rays is sufficient to detect them with satellites in orbit above the atmosphere. Studies with very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays, above about 100 GeV, require detectors with thousands of square meters of collection area, which can only be built on the ground. These ground-based devices detect gamma rays indirectly, by detecting the shower of secondary particles produced when a gamma ray interacts in the atmosphere. <br/><br/>This research will use the VERITAS imaging Cherenkov telescope array, now being completed in southern Arizona to study gamma rays with energy greater than about 100 GeV. There are a few hundred known gamma-ray sources at energies of 100 MeV to 10 GeV and about thirty VHE gamma-ray sources. The most powerful of these are extragalactic sources, which are believed to have narrow jets of high energy particles beamed for the observed sources in the direction of the Earth. How the jets form and what processes occur in the jets are questions studied by this project. <br/><br/>This proposal focuses on learning to use VERITAS to explore the extreme behavior of the two most powerful known classes of gamma-ray source: gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The details of how GRBs work and the role they play in other high energy phenomena are still being explored. Similarly, measurements of the VHE gamma-ray emission from AGN probe properties of the AGN jet, such as the size of the emission region and strength of the magnetic field. <br/><br/>This work has wide-ranging impacts, particularly in the areas of education and technological infrastructure. The public's curiosity about the Universe creates many opportunities to engage their interest and, in the case of students, participation. The researchers will work with their VERITAS collaborators to develop exhibits on high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics for use at science museums and observatory visitors' centers, and to host visiting groups at the VERITAS site."
1.02,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>The Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory is now measuring every high energy cosmic ray that lands in an area equal to the State of Rhode Island, but located in Argentina (with a sister array of detectors proposed for deployment in Colorado). It has measured more than one million cosmic rays, but 27 of them have proved to be especially meaningful. They are protons or atomic nuclei, whose arrival directions are correlated with the directions to Active Galactic Nuclei within 250 million light years from Earth. Their arrival directions can show us which astrophysical objects are capable of producing these particles that are 10,000,000 times more energetic than the most energetic particles that can be produced on Earth at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Europe. This will lead to an understanding of how Nature endows these special cosmic rays with extraordinary amounts of energy. A primary feature of the Auger Observatory is its blend of two measurement techniques used by previous experiments. First, an array of detectors on the ground samples and detects the cascade of particles, or ""air shower,"" produced in the atmosphere by the interactions of the parent cosmic ray. On dark nights, special telescopes also image the pattern of nitrogen fluorescence, or sky glow, generated by the passage of the particle cascade through the atmosphere. These two detection methods are complementary, so that by combining them we have the best possible measurements of these rarest of particles. We will determine if they are protons or heavy atomic nuclei and whether or not there are also photons (particles of light) or even neutrinos in the mix. The Auger group at Penn State University has experimental and analytical expertise in both detection techniques, and one of us (Sommers) serves as Co-Spokesperson of the International Auger Collaboration. We will continue our varied studies, both experimental and analytical, which address some of the primary questions that must be resolved in minimizing the uncertainties in the combination of the two techniques. In addition, we will exploit the Auger measurements of the air showers produced by these particles to deduce properties of particle interactions at energies far beyond the reach of laboratory studies on Earth. <br/><br/>High-energy cosmic rays are important cosmic messengers that will produce new insights about extreme processes in the universe. Exciting news in cosmology and high-energy astrophysics will be the theme of a continuing series of popular week-long summer workshops that we are offering for high-school teachers, in each of the next 3 consecutive years. The concepts of basic college physics are interwoven into the curriculum, so teachers strengthen their working knowledge of their core curriculum while getting an inside look at what is happening at the forefront of astrophysics research. The participants travel from all over the country to attend these workshops, and teachers from underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply. The teachers are provided with knowledge and tools to bring back into their classroom, to inspire and engage their students, and inform their appreciation of the scientific method.

STACEE uses an array of 64 large heliostats in the National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) solar power station at Sandia National Laboratory; these heliostats focus Cherenkov light from air-showers onto secondary optics and camera systems deployed in the central tower of the solar array. The goals of STACEE are to make high-resolution observations of astrophysical gamma-rays of energies between 50 and 1000 GeV region, a part of the spectrum previously unexplored. High-energy gamma-rays can be produced in neutron stars, supernovae, active galaxies and gamma-ray bursts. They could also be signatures for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and cosmology. With the addition of new Flash ADC's, the construction of STACEE is now essentially complete and the experiment has been taking data for a couple of years. The collaboration has observed two sources, the Crab Nebula and the active galaxy Markarian 421, and has set limits on other sources. The UCLA group negotiates and maintains the user facility agreement with Sandia Labs and is responsible for all STACEE operations at the NSTTF site.<br/><br/>In the education/outreach area, this particle astrophysics experiment may impact society through various technological innovations and is also involved in outreach efforts to K-12 students and summer REU students."
0.08,"Results from several observational astronomy experiments show that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter would be of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, high-energy particle physics, and our understanding of gravity. A leading hypothesis is that dark matter is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, an elementary particle beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, but predicted in various extensions including Supersymmetry. <br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration, supported jointly by NSF and DOE, has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors based on superconducting thin-film sensors to distinguish the rare scattering of such WIMPs on nuclei from other background events. Using our powerful technology in the Soudan mine, CDMS is currently (July 05) the most sensitive WIMP search experiment in the world, by a factor of ten. <br/><br/>The two years of funding provided by this NSF award will help support the Santa Clara University (SCU) group continue its active participation in the operation of the CDMS experiment at Soudan. The funding will also partially support the group's continued work on superconducting sensor technologies for cryogenic detector applications. This work includes physics and technology-focused investigations of superconducting aluminum alloy sensors (potentially of interest for SuperCDMS and other experiments), as well as continued work with CDMS collaborators on feasible extensions of the current tungsten-based technology to larger substrates for SuperCDMS. The SCU group will continue to be responsible for using existing, fast turn-around, dilution-refrigerator facilities at Stanford University to provide the CDMS collaboration with rapid characterization of superconducting films. Evaluations of future sensor technologies based on both physics reach and promise for enhanced device fabrication yields will be ongoing throughout this two year funding period.<br/><br/>The SCU group includes the P.I. and typically two undergraduates. The group benefits tremendously from its strong ties to groups at nearby institutions, particularly Stanford and UC Berkeley. CDMS collaborators at these institutions generously provide the SCU group access to their extensive cryogenic and device fabrication facilities and their support has allowed the SCU group to perform a variety of physics experiments related to CDMS and beyond, that otherwise would have been cost-prohibitive for the SCU group alone."
0.06,"This RUI proposal requests support for a program of research in elementary particle theory and phenomenology. Three specific aspects will be studied: (1)flavor symmetry and models with Higgs flavor multiplets; (2) supersymmetric models in warped spacetime; and (3) models for dark matter based upon singlets with respect to gauge and flavor symmetries. The goal of (1) is to derive the observed masses and mixings of quarks and leptons from a more fundamental theory. In the case of (2), the PI hopes to develop the collider phenomenology of certain unified models which predict light exotic states. Item (3) is a real challenge because, apart from gravitation, the singlets hardly interact with normal matter and one needs to know the scattering rates from normal matter in order to detect them directly. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal include the involvement of undergraduates in particle physics research, and the exposure of larger numbers of undergraduates at a predominantly liberal arts college to modern particle physics and its intimate connection with cosmology."

When dark matter particles pair-annihilate, or if they decay, photons and other radiating particles are produced and can be detected with gamma-ray, X-ray, optical and radio telescopes. The PI will also study how the microscopic particle features of dark matter effect the evolution of structure in the Universe,. and show how this might solve some open questions in cosmology and astrophysics. The issue of the generation of baryonic matter (baryogenesis) will be analyzed in its relationship with particle physics setups beyond the Standard Model, such as Supersymmetry. Imprints of the baryogenesis mechanism can emerge in a wide variety of fields that will be explored in the proposed research, such as searches for new particles with colliders, gravitational waves from the Early Universe and exotic properties of elementary particles.

0.09,"In the inflation scenario of how the early universe evolved, the universe undergoes a period of accelerated expansion which ensures that the present universe is homogenous and isotropic on large scales, and lays down the primordial perturbation spectrum that sources the temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and the formation of galaxies (and their associated large scale structure in the universe). Eternal inflation arises when the inflationary growth does not end globally, but only in a sub-regions or pockets of the overall spacetime. In this case, one typically has an infinite number of pockets, each of which effectively comprises the entire 'visible universe' of any observer that live inside a pocket. Many well-known models of inflation predict that inflation is eternal, but this possibility has usually been regarded as on the fringe of philosophy, since any given observer is unable to see anything outside their own pocket, and the eternal nature of inflation thus does not seem to have an immediately observable consequences. This proposal challenges that view and gives arguments that one can find direct experimental consequences of eternal inflation. The key component of this proposal is that one should study the collisions between different pockets shortly after their formation, which would generically lead to anisotropies visible from inside a single pocket. Since they are not generically expected in inflationary scenarios, these anisotropies would allow one to define specific signatures of eternal inflation that could then be compared to observational data. Specifically The PI proposes to study the detailed outcome of a generic bubble collision using exact solutions to Einstein?s equations. The then intends to do a linear analysis of the effect of perturbations on the bubble wall, and finally he intends to perform numerical simulations of bubble collisions, initially in fixed Minkowski and de Sitter backgrounds, then in full general relativity. The PI will attempt to connect these results to, on the one hand, our observed CMB sky, and, on the other hand, the underlying picture of eternal inflation with many minima. The proposed research will greatly increase the understanding of open inflation and bubble collisions, which are of great current relevance in inflationary cosmology; further, it may well suggest other avenues of observationally testing both eternal inflation and the string landscape. The PI will be involved in several outreach efforts including public talks, presentations and programs as part of the SCIPP/UCSC Physics outreach program, and outreach online through blogging and other activities"

The intent of the experiment is to search for possible scale length variations in G that have been hypothesized in an effort to produce a unified field theory in modern physics. If a scale length variation exists it will verify the existence of a fifth force of nature (about which there has been much recent publicity) and will have a significant effect on many branches of modern physics including general relativity, unified field theory, astrophysics, and cosmology. The proposed experiment consists of measuring the difference in gravity between the top and bottom of the greenland continental ice sheet through a borehole at Dye 3 using a LaCoste & Romberg borehole gravity meter. By measuring the acceleration of gravity, the depth interval of the experiment, and the density of the ice, G can be calculated. Others have found anomalous variations in gravity with depth in mines that could be explained by allowing G to be greater than the laboratory value by almost 1%. Uncertainty in the density of rock near mines makes this result inconclusive, Because the density of ice is much better known, the experiment proposed here will be much more accurate than any previous geophysical measurement of G.

The potential scientific impact of obtaining this data for Quasar research is very high. There is a risk that this potentially very important data may not be obtainable with the HET. Extrapolating from the present performance of the telescope in the visual, it is clear that the proposed, modified spectrograph is expected to be useful for obtaining data on sources brighter than V=17 mag. However, the quasars at this redshift range lie in the magnitude range V=18 to 19 mag. Simulations show that the absorption lines in the quasars are detectable against the night sky background for 18th mag objects with an image disk of 1.5 arc seconds but the HET does not at present have the long-term, on-target stability necessary to maintain image sizes of 1.3 to 1.5 arc seconds.

These observations will be used to try and distinguish between dwarf galaxies which have been formed in the debris left behind when larger galaxies were tidally disrupted and those which were formed primordially.<br/><br/>Tidal dwarf galaxies have long been recognized as occasional interlopers in the debris of galaxy interactions. The proposers have recently conducted a census of the dwarf galaxy population in Hickson compact groups, and the results strongly suggest that tidal dwarf galaxy formation is quite common. Depending on the survivability of the population, this process may be <br/>quite significant, even as compared to primordial formation of dwarfs. The proposed project incorporates spectra obtained with the 8-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope images, and Very Large array radio maps of the neutral Hydrogen from which the dwarfs form. With these data, we will compare properties of tidal dwarf galaxies to the galaxies at large in the groups, look for HI bridges connecting departing dwarfs to their parents, and assess the survivability of the dwarfs in the compact group environment. If the results of this study are extrapolated to consider other environments, it will be possible to evaluate if tidal dwarf formation is merely one of the occasional curiosities of the universe, or if it is important to our overall understanding of galaxy formation.

0.18,"AST 0098416<br/>Meszaros<br/><br/>Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and the active nuclei of galaxies (AGNs) outshine every other gamma-ray source in the sky. GRB are stellar remnants thought to be powered by black holes with masses several times the mass of the sun, which, in a few seconds, emit as much energy as our entire Milky Way does in a hundred years. However, it is not understood what kinds of stars give rise to these events, nor what is the exact mechanism whereby they produce gamma-rays, neutrinos and charged cosmic rays, nor how frequently or how far back in time they occur. AGNs, on the other hand, are suspected of harboring giant black holes, more massive than millions of suns, and are known to accelerate jets of electrons, which produce radio waves, light and ultra-high energy gamma rays. However, it is unclear if these jets also contain protons and neutrons, like some giant neutron gun, which would also entail highly penetrating neutrinos. Both ultra-high energy protons and neutrinos are targets for giant cosmic ray and neutrino telescopes being built by NSF in Argentina and in the South Pole, which will probe energies millions of times higher than any ever achieved in Earth laboratories. This is uncharted territory, and we need to know the theoretical ranges of possible results. A comparison of theoretical models with these experiments is imperative, in order to test the validity of current ideas (or the need for new ones) about how our Universe functions. This project will identify key features distinguishing different conceptions, which will allow an optimization of the design of planned experiments, and the testing of the various competing theories. The results would have far-reaching consequences for a range of questions in astrophysics, including how far into the cosmic past can we peer, what is the total energy content of the Universe, and are the laws of physics different or not at these higher energies and earlier times in the age of the Universe Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***"
0.334645,"This award supports the renewal of an REU site in the Department of Physics of the University of California at Davis. The research mentors and potential projects come from all areas of the department: biophysics, condensed matter, computational physics, cosmology, nuclear, and high energy physics. Students are assigned to research labs based on their skills and stated interests. The program gives students views of physics not seen in typical coursework: first-hand experience of the joys and frustrations of research, and exposure to several types of physics careers. The students will benefit not only from their specific research projects but also from interactions with Davis faculty, graduate students, and other REU students; and from field trips showing physics-related work in diverse settings. At the end of the program, each participant gives a 15-minute research presentation and writes a short paper describing the work. There is a program of both formal and informal talks and discussions among the REU students and various faculty involved in the program. The REU site targets a mixed group of students, strongly encouraging applications from non-research institutions in northern California as well as selecting many participants from four-year colleges and universities across the nation."
0.02,"We are proposing a conference centered on the theme of evaluating future<br/>directions in the development of 3-dimensional geometry and topology.<br/>The purpose of the conference is to review significant recent developments<br/>in the theory of 3-manifolds and to discuss how they will affect the course<br/>of future research. The conference will be held at the University of<br/>Michigan at Ann Arbor. The planned dates for the conference are May 6 <br/>to May 9, 2005.<br/>We expect 50 to 80 participants, about one third of whom will be <br/>graduate students.Some talks will be tailored specifically for graduate students.<br/><br/>Several important recent developments that are likely to influence the<br/>future of 3-dimensional geometry and topology.<br/>1. The work of Grisha Pereleman on the evolution of a metric on a <br/>3-dimensional manifold under the Ricci flow is still being absorbed and reviewed by the mathematical community. It is clear however that it has the potential to radically <br/>change the directions and techniques used in the study of 3-dimensional topology and related fields. The aim for this conference is not to focus on the details of Pereleman's methods but rather on their implications. What other problems are amenable to study by Ricci flow techniques? Which <br/>of the traditional theorems and results of 3-manifold theory become subsumed in <br/>geometrization? What questions become important if Pereleman's geometrization results hold <br/>up. What are the implications to related areas such as geometric group theory and the <br/>differential geometry of surfaces in 3-manifolds? Will the entire field of 3-manifolds <br/>become less important with this major problem solved, or will go on to have even greater importance?<br/>2. What are the likely future developments in Geometric Group Theory, and in<br/>Topological Methods in Group Theory, areas largely based on ideas from 3-manifold<br/>theory. Stallings first, and more recently Rips and Sela have shown that 3-manifolds<br/>are prototypes in many ways for general finitely presented groups.<br/>3. Ozsvath and Szabo have developed a theory of holomorphic curves associated<br/>to Heegaard decompositions of closed 3-manifolds, leading to what they call<br/>""Heegaard Floer homology"". What impact will this have in understanding 3-manifolds<br/>and to other areas? Related to this is the work of Khovanov and Rasmussen defining<br/>and applying a Jones polynomial homology.<br/>4. Four dimensional techniques such as gauge theory and related topics have had<br/>some applications to problems in 3-manifolds. Thus Kronheimer and Mrowka<br/>give a proof of Property P (also implied by geometrization). What further<br/>impact on 3-manifold theory are such techniques likely to have?<br/>5. Many invariants of knots and 3-manifolds have been developed over <br/>the last two decades, including knot polynomials, finite type invariants etc. How useful <br/>are these in understanding 3-manifolds? What ties do they have to geometric properties of <br/>manifolds such as hyperbolic volume?<br/>6. Are there significant emerging opportunities to apply the methods of 3-manifold<br/>theory to areas such as Computational Geometry and Cosmology as well as fields<br/>such as Computer Aided Design and Computational Complexity. What ties are developing between the theory of 3-manifolds and such disciplines?"
0.869163,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>Dr. Jessica Rosenberg (George Mason University) will use two large overlapping surveys which probe the galaxy population at optical and 21-cm (HI) wavelengths to study the baryons in galaxies. The nature and distribution of the baryons in galaxies can test predictions of the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (Lambda-CDM) model while also providing a probe of the astrophysical processes that affect the state of the baryons in galaxies. Ultimately, this project will address two of the most important questions in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology today: (1) is the Lambda-CDM model correct? and (2) how do the astrophysical processes governing star formation and galactic feedback affect the evolution of galaxies? This can be done because there are now large area surveys in both optical and radio (21-cm) wavelengths, so that studying the stars and gas simultaneously in a statistically significant sample of galaxies in a single volume of space is finally possible.<br/><br/>This study will break new ground in our understanding of the fundamental components of galaxies in the local universe, and will have a legacy value to the entire astronomical community in the form of readily available catalogs containing the combined optical and HI data for more than 30,000 galaxies in the overlap region between the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

0.094467,"With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Spike Gildea and his colleague Desrey Fox will conduct three years of linguistic research on Akawaio, an indigenous language in Guyana that is a member of the Cariban language family. One goal of their research is to create the first comprehensive reference grammar of Akawaio. Another is to publish on the web the collection of transcribed, translated, and annotated Akawaio texts that Ms. Fox will prepare as part of her doctoral dissertation. Preliminary research indicates that certain aspects of Akawaio grammar are unlike anything ever documented before, so a careful grammatical description supplemented and illustrated by annotated texts will benefit linguistic theory. The grammatical description will expand Dr. Gildea's reconstruction of the grammar of Proto-Carib, the ancestor language for all modern Cariban languages. It is already clear that Akawaio forms a group with its closest neighbors (the Pemong Group), but relationships between this group and other languages and/or groups in the Cariban family are unclear, in large part because there is so little reliable information about many of the languages (including Akawaio). The grammar and associated wordlist will provide additional bases for connecting the Pemong Group to other Cariban languages/groups. The collection of texts will also be of great interest to anthropologists, as they address traditional ways of life, oral history, Akawaio cosmology, and shamanistic practices. They will be especially valuable because they were recorded by Ms. Fox, a native Akawaio with anthropological training.<br/><br/>Two important scientific debates motivate the documentation of little-known languages. First, each new language tests theories about the human capacity for language. Second, each comparative reconstruction provides information that can inform hypotheses about early connections among peoples, including their migration patterns. The indigenous languages of Guyana are virtually unknown, and thus have not contributed significantly to either debate until now. Such documentation is urgent because so many languages are in danger of disappearing in the near future. In addition, documentation of endangered languages like Akawaio is a prerequisite to the creation of educational materials that may help prevent language loss."

The electronic lexical database contains information on the language and endangered domains of cultural knowledge of interest to a wide range of scholars --linguists, particularly those interested in comparative studies; anthropologists, who will not only be interested in the documentation of the material culture but also on the extensive vocabulary concerning cosmology and philosophy; historians; botanists and zoologists; the Ecuadorian public in general and the Tsachila themselves. Because the lexical database and grammar will be based on a large corpus of already collected material, both works will be quite comprehensive. Finally, the project is highly collaborative. A trained team of members from the Tsachila organization PIKITSA will do much of the work themselves and all materials will be archived in the community as well as made available to the research community worldwide."
0.135,"This award supports research to understand the properties of ""negative energy."" One focus is on methods of indirectly detecting this unusual form of energy using, in part, techniques developed in the field of quantum optics. The PI and a collaborator will work with an experimentalist to determine if such detection is feasible. A second major focus will be to study the distribution of energy fluctuations in the vacuum. Contrary to our experience in everyday life, the laws of quantum physics tell us that ""empty"" space is not really empty but consists of ever-present fluctuations of energy. The average value of the energy in empty space is zero, as one would expect, but quantum mechanics says that there must be fluctuations around this mean value. In order to average out to zero, there must be both negative as well as positive fluctuations. What is the likelihood then of getting a negative value in a single measurement? Previous work yields a surprisingly high probability for one spatial dimension. Current efforts are geared toward trying to determine the form of this ""probability distribution"" in the three-spatial-dimensional world in which we live.<br/><br/>The laws of quantum mechanics allow the existence of states of energy that are lower than that of the vacuum. If there are no restrictions on negative energy, then bizarre macroscopic effects might become possible. These would include wormholes and warp drives for faster-than light travel, violations of the second law of thermodynamics (e.g., refrigerators with no power sources), and the destruction of black holes. However, the same laws of quantum mechanics which allow this form of energy to exist severely limit its behavior. Typically, the longer the negative energy lasts, the smaller its magnitude. This work lies at the juncture of the fields of quantum theory, Einstein's general relativity, and thermodynamics. The only direct probe of negative energy is gravity, but the amounts of negative energy obtainable in the laboratory are minute. Therefore, one has to resort to indirect detection, such as measuring the effect of negative energy on atomic decay rates. The issue of the form of the probability distribution for energy fluctuations is key to understanding the structure of the vacuum, and has implications for other fields such as cosmology. Undergraduates are being prepared to engage in this research through Mathematica-based courses developed by the PI."

0.0513,"The main purpose of this research project is to study the topology and geometry of low and higher dimensional manifolds. Particular attention will be paid to symmetries of manifolds. The problems which will be studied cover a large spectrum of questions, ranging from very specific problems concerning low- dimensional manifolds to general problems concerning the geometry of positively curved higher dimensional manifolds. The main techniques which will be employed in this research include: gauge theory, surgery, homotopy theory, transformation groups and differential geometry. Manifolds are very natural objects to study. They are the spaces which are locally like Euclidean spaces. For example, the space in which we live (ignoring time), has three dimensions, making it a three-dimensional manifold, locally, but not necessarily globally, like Euclidean three-space. Taking time into account, physical space becomes a four-dimensional manifold. Whether it is globally Euclidean four-space or some other, possibly bounded, four-dimensional manifold is a deep question of cosmology. Answering this question is not a matter for mathematics alone, but exploring the various possibilities is an important and properly mathematical matter."

Pulsars have many astrophysical applications, including strong-field gravity, condensed matter physics, particle physics, planetary astronomy, and even cosmology. While pulsars radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, there are over 1100 known radio pulsars and only 40 known X-ray and/or gamma-ray pulsars. Consequently, the relationship between low- and high-energy emission and the emission processes themselves are not well-understood. This research program will lead to a more complete census of the pulsar population, a better understanding of emission mechanisms, and the discovery of unique individual objects. Techniques for discovery will include radio searches for counterparts to high-energy sources and pulsars that are likely to be detectable at high energies, as well as high-energy searches, spectroscopy, and imaging.

0.385512,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br/><br/>Generalized geometries form a class of almost complex manifolds with reduced structure groups, which have become of central importance to the study of realistic string theory models. These are natural generalizations of Calabi-Yau manifolds and are of mathematical interest in their own right. In one class important for string theory, the canonical structure one seeks on a generalized Calabi-Yau manifold is governed by a ``warp factor equation'' that couples a balanced Hermitian metric to an anti self-dual connection of a vector bundle. When the manifold is Kahler Calabi-Yau and the vector bundle is the tangent bundle, this system reduces to the Calabi conjecture for Ricci-flat metrics. The mathematical understanding of generalized geometries is still in its nascent stage. The purpose of this proposal is to develop this field further, into a full-fledged extension of Kahler Calabi-Yau geometries. We will focus on the following tightly interconnected problems: constructing new solutions to string theory in this class; characterizing the deformations and specifically the moduli of these spaces; understanding ""worldsheet instantons"" and their enumerative geometry in these manifolds; and an understanding of ""generalized calibrations,"" the analog of calibrated submanifolds of special holonomy manifolds.<br/><br/>The proposed project is to study the mathematics of a new class of geometric objects called ""generalized geometries"", and the appearance of this class in string theory. Mathematically, these structures provide interesting and natural extensions of a well-known class of geometric constructions in Calabi-Yau geometry. Physically, these extensions are known to be required to capture essential features of particle physics and cosmology, and will push string theorists closer to the goal of making contact with observations.

Enormous amounts of energy are generated by stars and gas falling into a super-massive black hole that may weigh as much as a billion suns. Much of the energy is focused into jets of matter moving at nearly the speed of light. These jets radiate visible light, x-rays and radio waves, which can be observe. This work aims to determine what the jets are made of, and how they are focused. The ultimate goal is to understand better the physics of massive black holes, and how they generate energy.<br/><br/>The second part of this project is to use these same quasars and galaxies to measure how fast the universe is expanding. They are so bright that they can be seen almost to the edge of the observable universe, and back in time to when the universe was very young. This project will use a new and direct way of measuring the distances to these quasars and galaxies.

The X-ray binary star system Sco X-1 is the only known Galactic object to exhibit a radio morphology similar to the classical extragalactic double radio sources. It is also the only known double-lobed radio source with a neutron star as its energy source. It has been suggested that the process of forming the lobes in Sco X-1 is similar to that in the luminous extragalactic objects. Investigation of Sco X-1 can impact a number of fields of astrophysics and plasma physics. Understanding dual-beam extragalactic sources is important to cosmology, to active galactic nuclei, and to jets. Space and laboratory plasma physicists are interested in the mechanics of jet acceleration, stability of the beams during energy and momentum transport, and the interaction of the beams with targets. Dr. Geldzahler and his collaborators have designed observations to more clearly reveal the character of Sco X-1 and thus better understand the linkage between this source and extragalactic core-jet-lobe sources and to better understand the plasma physics of this phenomenon."

For the first time, a nearly complete census of soft and hard X-ray sources can now be made using images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and follow-up observations will be made from the ground at radio, submillimeter, infrared and optical wavelengths. Study of the supermassive black holes in the host galaxies should help to resolve one of the most important questions about the thermal history of the Universe, namely, whether the intergalactic medium was reionized by accreting black holes or by stars. The combination of very deep with wide area data will determine the luminosity function for active galactic nuclei and thus reconstruct the black hole accretion history of the Universe.<br/><br/>The significant discoveries that will be made in this very special era of observational cosmology will be presented to the public and to educators through various programs.<br/>***"
0.27,"AST 0098670<br/>McWilliams<br/><br/>Interstellar magnetic fields play a central role in a variety of important processes in galaxies, notably in star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds. Yet the origin of galactic magnetic fields is poorly understood. This project is conducting numerical studies of the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies in order to determine how their strength and geometry change over time in response to the combined effects of small-scale disturbances such as supernovae and star formation and large-scale disturbances such as galactic-scale accretion and differential rotation. The project's goals include understanding why the field in our Galaxy undergoes a transition from a relatively weak azimuthal field in the Galactic disk to a strong, dipole field at the Galactic center. The detailed nature of the transition zone will be explored, with particular focus on the stability of the transition and the interplay between the magnetic field and individual clouds.

In addition to its search mode, the signal processor can be used for pulse timing of known pulsars and as a flexible spectrum analyzer. Research into pulsars with millisecond periods and the related binary pulsars is evolving rapidly. These objects have established new constraints on the internal structure of neutron stars and on neutron star magnetospheres. Pulse time-of-arrival measurements of these pulsars have had a tremendous impact on a number of branches of science: on high density matter physics, on Solar System ephemeris development, and on general relativity and cosmology. Dr. Backer's research is at the forefront of discovering more members of this important class of pulsars."

0.755604,"AST-0905099<br/>Simon<br/><br/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the earliest possible image of the Universe, consisting of primordial photons last scattered only 400,000 years after the Big Bang. The statistics of the tiny anisotropies in the CMB temperature and polarization encode not only the parameters of cosmology, but also insights into fundamental physics at the highest energies. In addition CMB science has been very successful in engaging the public. Since its discovery, CMB experiments have sought to detect ever fainter signals at ever higher resolution, requiring ever increasing data volumes. For the last decade the analysis of CMB data sets has become a high performance computing challenge. This project will take the current state-of-the-art CMB simulation and analysis code suite and undertake the computer science research program needed to take it from the tera- to the peta-scale and beyond, informed by the actual requirements of some of the most computationally-challenging planned CMB polarization experiments, including the proposed CMBpol satellite mission.<br/><br/>The project will start by creating a stripped-down test code that retains all of the computational but none of the scientific complexity of the existing core code base, which will be used to implement a range of possible solutions to known current bottlenecks. The second phase will pass the lessons learned with the test code back into the full science code suite, and use it to perform previously intractable analyses as proof of performance. This includes implementing run-time self-tuning. The project will also use its proof of performance tests to undertake currently intractable analyses in support of next-generation experiments, to field a new tool for application-driven whole-system performance analysis, and to introduce a new generation of data analysts to ultra high performance computing.<br/><br/>The research team includes PI Simon, an authority on high performance computing systems and trends, as well as sparse matrix algorithms, and CoPI Borrill, who has led the efforts to deploy high performance computing for CMB data analysis, both on specific missions and for the international CMB community as a whole. Long-term collaborator Stompor works with the Planck HFI data analysis team in Paris, and faculty associates Yelick and Demmel add valuable expertise. Leading scientists associated with many of the current ground-based, balloon, and satellite CMB experiments have agreed to lend their expertise, as associates to this project."

0.268076,"The International Germanium Experiment (IGEX) is an intense search for an exotic nuclear decay mode, nutrionless double-beta decay, the existence of which would definitely prove that neutrinos are their own<br/>anti-particles, and have non-zero mass. Presently the experiment is being operated in the Canfranc Underground Laboratory operated by the University of Zaragoza in Spain, and includes three large germanium<br/>detectors fabricated with isotopically enriched germanium from the former Soviet Union. At present a forth detector is being fabricated with funding from the US Department of Energy. This experiment, and its competitor the Heidelburg-Moscow experiment, have produced the most sensitive search for this type of exotic process thus far. IGEX has recently developed very high quality pulse shape electronics techniques that allow the elimination of much of the interfering background which will further increase its sensitivity. This grant supports the technical leader and spokesman of the experiment and three graduate students. The spokesman's institute, the University of South Carolina, also supports travel and subsistence of Russian participants. The IGEX collaboration is composed of twenty-six researchers from the United States, Spain, and the former Soviet Union. The grant also provides partial support for the Principle Investigator to participate in the development of next generation, significantly enlarged double-beta decay experiments using newly development cryogenic techniques. Since these techniques have not yet demonstrated their ability to reduce interfering background to the necessary levels, the germanium-76 experiments still represent the most sensitive technique for searching for this important exotic nuclear decay mode and its implications for the existence of neutrino mass. These experiments represent very sensitive tests of the standard model of elementary particle physics, and have the potential for a significant impact in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology."
0.07874,"Although tremendous progress has been made towards understanding relationships between curvature and topology, the classical topic of positive/nonnegative sectional curvature still suffers from an insufficient supply of examples. The PI proposes two different methods for exploring rigidity and constructing new examples of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative and positive sectional curvature. The first method begins with the question: classify the left-invariant metrics with nonnegative curvature on each compact Lie group. Almost all known constructions of nonnegative curvature begin with a bi-invariant metric, so answering this question would help us measure the rigidity of the known constructions, and could lead to new examples of nonnegatively curved manifolds with (at least points of) positive curvature. The second method is related to past research in which the PI developed conditions under which vector bundles admit nonnegative curvature. More precisely, if a vector bundle admits nonnegative curvature, then a fundamental differential inequality relates the three curvatures which are visible at points of its soul: the curvature of the soul, the curvature of the connection in the normal bundle of the soul, and the curvature of planes orthogonal to the soul. Conversely, if a vector bundle admits structure which strictly satisfy this inequality, then the unit sphere bundle admits positive sectional curvature. The PI proposes to use this theorem to find new examples, obstructions, and rigidity theorems for metrics with nonnegative (respectively positive) curvature on vector bundles (respectively sphere bundles).<br/><br/>Differential Geometry provides the mathematical language for precisely describing Einstein's theory of relativity, particle physics, and high dimensional curved shapes (called manifolds). The PI's proposed work within this field involves the study of manifolds with positive curvature, which is a visually natural restriction on the way in which a manifold curves about in space. Past examples come from Lie groups, which are indispensable tools in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, computer animation, and other disciplines in which simplification is achieved through symmetry. <br/>The search for new examples of manifolds with positive curvature has a long history, yet frustratingly few examples have been found. The PI proposes substantially new methods for constructing more examples, which could thereby lead to a better general understanding of the relationship between curvature and global shape."

Berkeley <br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Sadoulet, Bernard<br/><br/>TITLE: DUSEL Research and Development on subKelvin germanium for ton scale dark matter search<br/><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Deciphering the nature of dark matter in the universe is one of the most urgent tasks in cosmology and particle physics today, and a successful program to detect Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) critically depends on the performance of the instrumentation available. This proposal requests support to enable improved future experiments for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL). This effort is directed at improving the position resolution and rejection capability of the phonon-mediated plus ionization detector technology, which currently reaches the best WIMP sensitivity, and therefore is likely to open new scientific opportunities for a ton scale dark matter experiment. <br/><br/>The UC Berkeley group is a member of the SuperCDMS collaboration which will operate 25 kg of germanium sub-Kelvin detectors at the SNOLAB underground laboratory, aiming to reach a sensitivity approaching 10^(&#8722;45) cm^2 for spin independent cross sections and WIMP masses near 60 GeV. Such a sensitivity reach is scientifically very important and explores much of the same parameter space as the Large Hadron Collider for supersymmetric dark matter in the form of the lightest supersymmetric particle. <br/><br/>The DUSEL facility may be ready for experiments as early as 2012 or 2013 and it will be scientifically important to build at least one ton-scale dark matter experiment to improve further the sensitivity for WIMPs. It is natural to select the best one or two technologies around 2009-2010, most likely the sub-Kelvin and noble liquid strategies. For the sub-Kelvin technology, there is a need to improve background rejection and to develop mass production techniques to reduce costs and increase fabrication yields. In this three-year proposal, support is requested for one postdoctoral fellow and one undergraduate. This modest level of support will allow the group to fabricate and test several detector designs. <br/><br/>The CDMS team has been at the forefront of phonon-mediated and superconductor detector development, which already has broad impacts, in particular in the fields of Cosmic Microwave Background and of X-ray astrophysics. The proposed effort is likely to broaden this impact."

A current aim is to<br/>construct examples of minimal submanifolds with singular sets which<br/>include ``gaps'' and other phenomena, the possibility of which is left<br/>open by his previous general work on the structure of the singular<br/>set. He is also proposing to complete work on the singular set of<br/>mod-2 currents to show that, in all dimensions, the top-dimensional<br/>part of the singular set locally lies in a finite union of<br/>continuously differentiable submanifolds. Simon also proposes to<br/>pursue several questions related to asymptotics on approach to<br/>singularities. Brian White plans to study how regularity properties<br/>and singular structure for minimizing chains with coefficients in a<br/>metric group depend on the group and its metric. This includes study<br/>of immiscible fluid interfaces as a special case. He also plans to<br/>investigate singularities in the mean-curvature flow. He will<br/>continue his investigations of 2-dimensional minimal surfaces, in<br/>particular concerning branch points and concerning total boundary<br/>curvature.<br/><br/>An understanding of singularities, and how singularities are formed,<br/>is a fundamental element in our overall understanding of many physical<br/>and geometric phenomena. For example, in cosmology singularities of<br/>space-time (e.g. ``black holes'') play a fundamental role. Likewise<br/>in the study of the ``canonical'' objects which arise naturally in<br/>topology and geometry, singularities arise in a very natural and<br/>unavoidable manner, and the understanding of these singularities is an<br/>absolutely fundamental problem. As with most non-linear phenomena,<br/>there is not a single general theory which applies in a wide range of<br/>different contexts. Rather, each different context has its own<br/>collection of effective techniques, and it is the development and<br/>application of such techniques in the context of the geometric<br/>calculus of variations which is the focus of the present research<br/>proposal. Specifically, Simon and White propose to continue their<br/>efforts toward a complete understanding of singularities, and how they<br/>are formed, in the context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy<br/>minimizing maps. Such techniques are likely to be applicable to the<br/>study of other objects of geometric and physical significance---for<br/>example to the study of immiscible fluid interfaces, soap-films, and<br/>the equilibrium free surfaces of fluids."

Many-body and many-particle systems are encountered, for example, in studies of the dynamics of biological macromolecules, in drug design, in the simulation of plasmas, in vehicle and space-structure simulation, and in cosmology. Related problems arise through spatial semidiscretization of time-dependent partial differential equations. By looking beyond the application-specific features of the various codes and numerical techniques, this project will seek new, broadly applicable mathematical and computational tools for dynamical simulations. The focus of the mathematical study will be on preserving and exploiting Hamiltonian structure in the equations of motion, e.g. by using new symplectic discretization schemes. The project will broaden the current research dialogue among numerical analysts by considering constrained Hamiltonian systems and nearly Hamiltonian systems. Methods suited to implementation on parallel computers will be sought. At all stages, computational efficiency and practicality will be emphasized over mere mathematical novelty, and an experimental approach consistent with the tradition of the physical sciences will be adopted."

0.024065,"9318671 Dehmelt This proposal, ""Single Atomic Particle at Rest in Free Space 4 (SEPARIS 4)"", is for the continuation of efforts to approach the fundamental limits of resolution and accuracy in optical spectroscopy for an individual atomic ion elastically bound in a purely electric rf trap. The aim is an accuracy of; one part in 1018. The best ""accuracy"" and 1000-day stability realized in the past is 1013 or 105 less. The new ""accuracy"" would mean that independent frequency measurements on the same atomic line by two different groups in the same laboratory agree to better than 1018 and long term (108 sec or 1000 days) stability is as good. This would have numerous implications for measurements in fundamental physics and cosmology. The precision of current atomic clocks is already being strained by the extraordinarily high timing stability of the millisecond pulsars and the needs of space missions. The mass loss of other pulsars due to gravitational radiation could not have been observed without precise atomic clocks. Closer to home the Global Positioning System relies crucially on precise atomic clocks. There seems to be an unlimited field of new applications in metrology as more and more measuring tasks are reduced to precise frequency measurement."
0.05745,"9420088 Buck The investigator and his colleague undertake an extensive computational and analytical study of the energy surfaces given by the energy functions on finite-dimensional conformation spaces of knots. The focus is on two conformation spaces: polygonal knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic knots are those given by finite Fourier series parametrizations. Recent theorems relate the invariants given by these energy functions to classical invariants such as crossing number. So this project should lead to a better understanding of knots realizable with relatively low degrees of freedom. Knot theory is the mathematical study of the everyday objects called knots. Once thought the purview of theoretical mathematicians, knot theory has recently found a wide range of applications, in fields as diverse as molecular biology and cosmology. For example, DNA molecules are usually knotted, and in the replication process must somehow become untangled. In this project the investigators apply sophisticated computing techniques to the study of knots. In particular, they continue the development of a new approach to knots: physical knot theory. The mathematical knot is given physical properties, and knot types are distinguished by computations involving these properties. For example, knot conformations can be assigned an energy, and then knot types can be distinguished by considering minimum energy conformations. The conceptual basis of the approach is familiar to researchers in biology, chemistry, and physics as well as mathematics. The project produces both theoretical results and software."

This unexpected observation could be explained if the Universe is pervaded by dark energy, which could be in the form of a cosmological constant. Although particle theories, including string theory, can accommodate a cosmological constant, they generally require a much larger value than is compatible with the nature of the Universe revealed by cosmological observations. As a result, the ultimate cause of the acceleration of the Universe remains obscure, and other theoretical possibilities exist. The research of Wasserman, Flanagan, and Bean will examine these important issues in various different studies. One study will examine how accurately it can be established that the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant.

Radiative transfer models based on these measurements can determine the internal thermodynamic properties of molecular clouds, providing insights about the star formation process and the dynamics of cloud formation and destruction in the Galactic environment. For example, the Galactic Center key project data show that the smooth ring of molecular material 150 parsecs from the Galactic Center is on the verge of coagulating into a single, massive molecular cloud like the one surrounding Sgr B2, and will undergo a burst of star formation.

The scientific effort will focus on understanding: 1) the formation of galactic disks in a cosmological context and the impact of feedback on galaxy morphology and kinematics; 2) the nature of gas inflows into galaxy halos and the accretion of gas by disks; 3) the interaction between accreted gas and galactic outflows of chemically enriched material and consequences for the circumgalactic medium; and 4) the co-evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. The simulation results, including snapshots of the full simulations, galaxy catalogs, images, and videos, will be made available to the research community through a web-based interface. The project will support the work of a postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student; in addition, a series of lectures will be developed to be given to high school students in Cambridge, MA on topics covering the evolution of the Universe and its constituents."
0.354448,"This project will further the development of a new computer code for cosmological N-body simulations. Abacus implements a novel method for computing gravitational forces that is a hundred times faster and substantially more accurate than current methods. It can be run on commodity graphics processing units and offers a vast improvement in price-performance. Observational surveys of large scale structure rely on cosmological simulations to calibrate their statistical estimators and compute accurate error bars, making it essential to run large grids of highly accurate simulations in order to realize the potential of current and future cosmological surveys. Abacus relies on a mathematical breakthrough that accomplishes a clean split between the near-field and far-field force on particles. The present work will add essential support for individual particle time steps, on-the-fly group finding and merger tree building, and light-cone outputs. The study will also extend Abacus to a parallel implementation, and allow release of a public version of the code.<br/><br/>The research team will use Abacus for a first suite of large simulations, whose resulting halo catalogs, merger trees, and light-cone outputs will be made public as a direct benefit to current and future survey projects. Abacus is a game-changer, opening up the ability to do large simulations to many more astrophysicists at exactly the time that the need for large sets of large simulations will intensify. The mathematical approach of Abacus opens up substantial new possibilities in the solution of elliptic equations, one of the most common computational tasks across a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Along the way, the project will train a post-doctoral researcher and a graduate student."
2.242341,"Dr. Donald Lamb of the University of Chicago will undertake a theoretical program to comprehensively and systematically validate current models of Type Ia supernovae, which are the explosions of white dwarf stars experiencing mass transfer from a nearby red giant. He and his group will carry out hundreds of high-fidelity, three-dimensional, whole-star simulations that include a wide variety of input model parameters. They will also use an integrated simulation pipeline to construct high-quality model light curves and spectra. The proposed effort will leverage the emergence of the Flash Center as a leader in this field and the extensive experience of personnel in the Center in conducting large and complex simulations of Type Ia supernovae. The FLASH code, developed by this group, is a highly capable, fully modular, extensible, community code that scales to 100K processors and has been used for a variety of problems by more than 300 scientists around the world. Their Phoenix, SEDONA, and LANL radiation transport codes and accompanying data management software, which has also been developed by the Flash Center, monitors the execution of the simulations, automatically transfers the data generated by the simulations to mass storage, incorporates a scientific data analysis pipeline, and provides an interface that allows astrophysicists doing the simulations to keep track of and manipulate all the data generated by the simulations.<br/><br/>Observations using Type Ia supernovae as ""standard candles"" revealed that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating and led to the discovery of dark energy. Understanding dark energy ranks among the most compelling problems in physical science. The goals of several large future projects, including the Dark Energy Survey the Joint Dark Energy Mission and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope are, in part, to determine the properties of dark energy. Most scientists in the field believe this goal will require a better understanding of the explosion mechanism, more accurate simulations of the explosions, and quantification of the uncertainties in the predictions made by these simulations. This group will also engage in several activities in education and public outreach. They will collaborate with staff at Chicago's Adler Planetarium to create museum exhibits that help foster public education about supernova science, and will continue their cooperation with broadcast media production companies."
0.5,"The University of Delaware has been selected as one of ten recipients of the National Science Foundation's Recognition Awards for the Integration of Research and Education. The university has implemented a systemic and realistic approach to integrating research into the undergraduate curriculum. The university engages as many undergraduates as feasible in meaningful research projects with faculty, and an office of undergraduate research promotes broad participation. More than 60% of the total faculty and 90% of the science and mathematics faculty participate. Special efforts are made to engage students from underrepresented minorities in this program. Some students begin their research activities in their first year at the university, and most begin in the sophomore year. Opportunities for summer research internships in industry and national laboratories are offered following the junior year. All senior honors research theses are read and evaluated by a Faculty Board and are presented at a university-wide research symposium. Recognizing that not all students will have access to true research experiences, the university provides discovery-based courses for all students. These courses take varied forms, including research apprenticeships, group research projects, engineering design courses, and a set of new interdisciplinary courses that use Problem-Based Learning. The University of Delaware's efforts to integrate research and education were designed with specific outcomes in mind: enhancing the skills, understanding, and personal characteristics gained by students through a research experience; increasing the numbers of students engaged in faculty research; increasing the proportion of undergraduate research participants who go on to graduate study; maintaining high levels of faculty participation; and expanding the number of PBL-based courses. The university is being awarded $500,000 with the goal of expanding, documenting, and disseminating its exemplary practices over the coming three years. Plans for the use of the award funds include: creating a challenge grant to increase support for summer research projects; increasing staff support for the undergraduate research coordinating office; conducting a longitudinal study of a sample of students during their undergraduate research experiences; surveying undergraduate research alumni; producing a video on PBL methods for pre-service teachers; and disseminating information through conferences and Web-based resources."

We integrate the pre-service courses for elementary teachers with each other and with mathematics. We progress towards our goals through specific initiatives targeted to the needs of each campus, course, and faculty member. Big Projects, where students design and conduct their own investigations over a period of weeks, are becoming self-sustaining and are exported to other courses and other campuses. One pair of physical science and biology courses is being thoroughly integrated in content and pedagogy, with instructors in one course teaching in the other, and with joint staff meetings. A summer retreat and some cross-disciplinary teaching will facilitate integration of mathematics and science at all three campuses. Our research on the successful treatment of the Nature of Science in one of our courses will support curriculum development in other courses. A laboratory manual is under contract with a commercial publisher, and we are seriously negotiating with another for a full textbook package.

Differences in fundamental physics lead to changes in the clustering patterns in the galaxy distribution. These patterns are measured by surveys that catalog vast numbers of galaxies, thus the universe as a particle physics laboratory. However, the complicated physics of galaxy formation impacts the clustering patterns as well, leading to systematic uncertainties in measuring the properties of dark energy and neutrinos. This project focuses on developing a detailed understanding of these uncertainties. <br/><br/>The approach being used consists of three main steps: First, build theoretical models that encode the galaxy formation physics and test them by comparing to data from current galaxy surveys and from simulations. Next, use these models to compute the precision and systematic uncertainties for dark energy and neutrino properties expected from future galaxy surveys. Finally, develop analysis methods that can be applied to future survey data that will optimize the results for these science goals. The expected outcome of this project is an analytical framework that can be used to account for galaxy formation physics when extracting information about dark energy and neutrinos from survey data.<br/><br/>Additionally, the PI will be actively involved in UCL Astrophysics public outreach activities: giving talks at local schools, assisting with tours and special events for the general public at the University of London Mill Hill Observatory, and developing materials for classroom observational projects."

Quilombo communities, towns and villages first settled by African slaves escaping bondage, represent a particularly burgeoning field. With few exceptions, however, research on Afro-Brazilians has been restricted to the Northeast and Southern regions of Brazil. Despite the presence of Afro-Brazilians in Amazonia for over 400 years, virtually no research on Afro- Brazilians has been conducted in this area. Moreover, almost no research on the African diaspora in Brazil has emerged from the human-environment sciences. While patterns of resource management practices by other cultural groups in Amazonia, such as Amerindians and the mixed peasantry (caboclos) have been widely documented, almost few studies have been conducted in Afro-Amazonian societies. Working in two quilombo communities in the Amazonian state of Amapá, Brazil this research seeks to document local perceptions of nature, environmental knowledge systems, and patterns of natural resource management. The project employs an interdisciplinary approach to determine if residents in the study area maintain a natural resource management system distinct from other cultural groups in the region. Through qualitative and quantitative methods, the project further documents changes in land-use throughout history and the shifting role of rural activities to local economies and to residents? sense of personal identity. <br/><br/>This project enhances research in the human-environment sciences by examining the role of African descended peoples to natural resource management practices, patterns of biodiversity, and landscape formations in Brazil."

0.27,"Some properties (e.g., rest masses) of the mysterious neutrinos remain elusive. Discovery of these properties may well represent new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and could give us insights into the evolution of the universe. In part, little is known about these particles because they interact so weakly that conventional laboratory experiments are rarely definitive. Serendipidously, however, neutrinos and neutrino interactions with matter may play a dominant role in the synthesis of the light nuclei in the early universe and in the synthesis of the heavy nuclei in supernova explosions. To the extent that we can understand the nuclear physics of these astrophysical environments, we may be able to employ them (that is, their observed nucleosynthesis products) as neutrino physics ""laboratories."" Conversely, new experimental insights into the properties of the neutrinos may allow us a better understanding of how nuclei were made in our universe.

0.753604,"While the Internet has far exceeded expectations, it has also stretched initial assumptions, often creating tussles that challenge its underlying communication model. Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP's requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today's focus on where ? addresses and hosts ? to what ? the content that users and applications care about.<br/>This project investigates a potential new Internet architecture called Named Data Networking (NDN). NDN capitalizes on strengths ? and addresses weaknesses ? of the Internet's current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their location, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth. The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture: routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory.

0.049774,"This archaeological project will examine how indigenous elites constituted their power in Xaltocan, Mexico when faced with changes in the conditions of political domination. Xaltocan, located approximately 50 km north of Mexico City, was once an independent regional capital. It was conquered by the Aztec, and it was later incorporated into the Spanish Empire. How did elites in Xaltocan, from the period of the site's independence, through domination by the Aztec Empire, and then under Spanish control, constitute their power? Are there clear distinctions between the patterns of consumption of elites and those of commoners during these three periods of political change in Xaltocan? This project will examine whether elites based their claims of social status upon local or upon regional sources of power, as reflected in their use of local or regional material culture and symbols. <br/>Due to a rare combination of circumstances, for the first time in 18 years of fieldwork it will be possible to excavate in the core area of Xaltocan to examine these questions. Activities will include excavation of a 5 x 10m unit in the center of Xaltocan, and analysis of all the materials and architecture recovered during excavation. The three main goals of the analysis will be: 1) to formulate a chronology for the excavated contexts, 2) to determine which materials were made locally, and which were imported to the site, and 3) to compare the different materials to other areas excavated within the site to determine whether there were significant differences in patterns of consumption between the site's core and peripheral areas. <br/><br/>This long-term archaeology of elite strategies will be relevant to scholarship on Aztec imperialism, and to work on empires and elites beyond Mesoamerica. Historical chronicles can provide a view of Aztec elites in urban centers, but they provide little information on rural sites. Furthermore, historical chronicles provide an ahistorical view of elite strategies. This project will provide a long-term view of elite strategies in a rural site, which will help move beyond the static view of elite strategies captured in historical chronicles. This study will contribute to recent comparative and regional studies on empires, states, and strategies of legitimation. By comparison with similar work in different world regions, the study will help clarify how states and empires change over time, and how elites within those empires transform their basis of power.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include the integration of students in different aspects of fieldwork and analysis, the dissemination of knowledge to a broad non-academic audience, and the participation of ethnic minorities (specifically Hispanic) and women in the project, both of which are underrepresented in academic archaeology.

The project aims to fulfill that objective by partnering with communities to explore local perceptions, responses, and ways to effectively address the local issues of GCC. The project is a four-village, three-year collaborative effort involving participation of village residents, native specialists and field assistants, an in-country research community and international collaborators. The project PI Crate has worked with the targeted communities for sixteen years and is fluent in both the native Sakha and Russian languages. Crate's 2003-2006 community sustainability project revealed that Viliui Sakha inhabitants consider the local effects of GCC to be their most substantial barrier to continued subsistence and residency. The proposed project represents a continuation of that research by assessing knowledge about the local impacts of GCC on the community, regional and Republic levels in order to decipher what is known and what needs to be known to fill knowledge gaps and positively inform community life. <br/>The project objectives are to: 1) Develop community-levels rosters of past and present knowledge of and adaptation to climate change; 2) Operationalize those roster data to develop measures and gauge the resilience and adaptive capacity of households and communities facing GCC; 3) Document local elders' knowledge about climate change that is both applicable and pragmatic for use in contemporary village-level adaptive schemes; 4) Survey the relevant western science on GCC (beginning in-country and moving to international) in order to fill the gaps in local knowledge to facilitate community-level adaptation and understanding; 5) Appraise policy efforts at the local, regional, Republic and national levels for their utility and make recommendations accordingly. Methods to be employed include: focus groups, semi-structured interviews, surveys and secondary data analysis.<br/>This study integrates research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while at the same time promoting teaching, training, and learning in at least four substantial ways: 1) by conducting our field research with the active participation of four village communities and village-level research assistants; 2) by collaborating with an in-country research team; 3) by working with a research assistant and two graduate students for the project's duration; and 4) by collaborating with an international research partner. <br/>By working at the local, regional and Republic levels and through collaborating with the in-country research institute and other partners on climate issues, the project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education networks and partnerships. The project team will disseminate the results of the project widely to enhance scientific and technological understanding via academic and non-academic publications, a project website, and by generating a set of resource materials available to others interested in community based climate change projects. The proposed activity is designed to benefit society on several levels, by increasing the understanding of the local effects of GCC for the targeted communities, by producing resource materials to share that knowledge with other populations, to inform policy decisions, and to enhance research collaborations and exchanges."

0.363329,"AST 0205960<br/>West<br/><br/>Understanding the origin and evolution of galaxies is one of the major goals of modern <br/>astrophysics. It is generally believed that galaxies arose from small density fluctuations in the <br/>primordial matter distribution that were amplified over time by gravity. However, our <br/>knowledge of the details of the galaxy formation process is still far from complete, and many <br/>important questions remain unanswered. How and when did galaxies form? How have they <br/>evolved over time? How do their environs influence galaxy properties? <br/><br/>Over the past few years, Dr. Michael West has been pursuing a number of original lines of research, both observational and theoretical, to address these questions. With this award he will build upon previous successes and explore new avenues that may lead to further insights about the <br/>genesis of galaxies. Specific goals of this project include the following: <br/> o One of the most promising ways to learn the secrets of galaxy formation is by studying their globular cluster populations. Globular clusters are dense aggregates of up to a million stars that are held together by their mutual gravitational attraction. Most galaxies are surrounded by systems of tens, hundreds, or thousands of globular clusters that swarm around them like bees around a hive. The present-day globular populations of galaxies reflect the cumulative effects of billions of years of ongoing galaxy formation and evolution via mergers and collisions, accretion, generations of star formation, and other processes. Careful analysis of a galaxy's globular cluster population can thus <br/>allow astronomers to reconstruct its history. A major goal of Dr. West's project is to undertake the most comprehensive study yet of the globular cluster systems of hundreds of galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters. <br/> o Dr. West and collaborators recently found evidence of the existence of a sizeable population of intergalactic globular clusters that are not gravitationally bound to individual galaxies but instead roam freely throughout the cores of galaxy clusters. The discovery of this new class of objects is an exciting result that invites further study, and searches for intergalactic globulars in several nearby galaxy clusters are currently underway. The colors, luminosity function, and spatial and velocity distributions of these intergalactic globulars will place strong constraints on their origin. <br/> o A growing body of evidence suggests that galaxy destruction might be a much more common occurrence than previously thought, and that the births and deaths of galaxies are intertwined. Rich galaxy clusters are especially harsh environments, where small galaxies can be cannibalized by larger ones, collisions between galaxies can strip material from their halos, ablation removes their interstellar gas, and galaxies may be partially or even completely torn apart by tidal fields as they travel through the cluster core. Yet the demise of some galaxies may also give rise to new ones, as material spilled into intergalactic space is eventually recycled into other galaxies. A goal of this research project is to conduct the first systematic survey to look for the faint remains of disrupted galaxies in galaxy clusters, in order to place quantitative constraints on the current rate of galaxy destruction in dense environments. <br/>This award is made under the auspices of the Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at the NSF. <br/>***"

Additional physical processes will also be included, including magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) and a simplified treatment of radiative transfer. <br/><br/>Dr. Bryan's educational effort will include: (1) the involvement of astronomy and physics undergraduates in the generation of scientific visualizations, and the creation of short movies that incorporate these visualizations; (2) the construction of a stereoscopic visualization system (the ""AstroWall"") in the Astronomy Department at Columbia University, to facilitate visualization of multi-dimensional datasets; and (3) bringing local New York high-school students and teachers into the Astrophysics Lab to do short-term research projects involving the analysis of large-dimensional datasets"
0.36,"This project focuses on the study of the transverse dynamics of a nearly-confocal nonlinear Fabry-Perot ring resonator, using a rubidium vapor cell placed in the resonator as a Kerr medium. Coupling by four-wave mixing of the transverse modes is predicted to produce a transverse cavity mode spectrum consisting of a central spike corresponding to the lowest on-axis TEM-00 mode, on top of a low pedestal of higher modes. The similarity of this transverse mode spectrum to the central spike formed by bosons in the momentum space distribution when they undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) suggests that these phenomena can also be understood by an analogy to BEC. Extending this analogy, the group will attempt to observe a BEC-like phase transition in which the well-collimated output beam corresponding to the central-spike momentum spectrum suddenly becomes uncollimated as a random modulation of the input laser light by crossed AOMs is increased beyond a certain critical amplitude."
0.152452,"Abstract AST-9420080 Peterson, Bradley M. . The variability of the broad emission lines in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveals fundamental information about the structure and kinematics of the line-emitting region and about the nature of the central source. Broad emission lines arise in clouds that are photoionized by a central continuum source and respond to variations in the continuum flux with a delay due to light-travel time; the structure and velocity field of the broad-line region can be determined by closely monitoring the response of the emission lines as the region reverberates in response to the continuum variations, making repeated observations of a limited number of sources. This is an ongoing project, as part of the International AGN Watch."

Such simulations try to approximate the continuous distribution function (DF) that fully characterizes the system at hand, with a discrete sample of particles. This work will provide solid foundations for evaluation of theoretical models, by constructing efficient algorithms to evolve a cosmologically relevant DF in the full six-dimensional phase space, a rather daunting task made tractable by the growth in available computational power. The 6D problem will be approached via 1D and 4D. The research will create efficient computational tools of use in theoretical astrophysics, plasma physics and computational fluid dynamics. It will provide benchmark simulations of cosmological structure formation, and lead to innovations in geometrical algorithms for the study of certain types of surfaces.<br/><br/>The project will engage students at the American University of Beirut and neighboring universities in fundamental research work. This involvement will help to make scientific computing a mainstay of research and education at the University. The broad collaborative dimension of the research will qualify the students' otherwise rather narrow exposure to current scientific practice."
0.145199,"A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes. Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. Nearly all galaxies appear to have massive central black holes (BHs)---many with ones much, much larger than our Milky Way's. Observations reveal close connections between galaxies and massive BHs. However, the formation of massive BHs, how they grow, and how they affect the galaxy life cycle via feedback remain poorly understood. Fundamental advances in our understanding of gas transport from galactic scales into galactic nuclei by gravitational torques and in observations of galaxy-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are transforming our understanding of BH growth and feedback and are enabling definitive progress in answering these questions. This project is a multi-scale simulation program that builds on these breakthroughs and on the investigators' previous analytic modeling. The project will begin with ultra-high resolution simulations (down to about 0.01 pc) of BH growth and feedback in galaxies and galactic nuclei.<br/><br/>The group will also produce visualizations from their simulations specifically designed to support their education and outreach efforts. The visualizations, which will include both time-dependent animations and 3-D interactive exploration modules, will be displayed at the Space Visualization Laboratory at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The PI, the postdoc funded by this award, and graduate students in the group will volunteer once a month for ""astronomy conversations"" at Adler, which attract up to 300 visitors per hour of all ages. Through these astronomy conversations, the team will explain the fascinating roles of black holes in galaxy evolution to the public. They will also integrate educational materials into a year long computational astrophysics course for high school students offered through Northwestern's Center for Talent Development. In the course, students learn to code in Python and apply these skills to pursuing an independent research project using a large astronomical data set of their choosing. Videos (which will include explanations of the science behind the simulations and of how they were created) will introduce the students to a new kind of simulated data set that they can work on for their projects. The investigators will also continue to actively involve undergraduate students in their research.<br/><br/>The project's simulations will include an explicit model for stellar feedback that self-consistently produces a multiphase interstellar medium and star-formation driven outflows. These simulations will be used to study the physics of BH accretion and the interaction of wide-angle AGN-driven outflows in a representative set of model galaxies, including the effects of AGN on gas and star formation, and to calibrate AGN fueling and feedback models for use in cosmological simulations. BHs will then be implemented in cosmological simulations (about 1 to 100 pc resolution) that will allow the PI to investigate the origin of massive BHs (seed models and the need for super-Eddington accretion), the emergence of galaxy-BH scaling relations, the role of AGN feedback in quenching star formation in massive galaxies, and the effects of AGN outflows on halo gas. A systematic approach, building up from small to larger scales, will enable the PI to resolve the main uncertainties of previous simulations of BHs on galaxy and cosmological scales. To maximize the impact of the simulations, radiative transfer calculations, which will allow a direct test of the results with a wealth of current and future observations, will be tightly incorporated in the project. The goal of this multi-scale BH study is to achieve for BHs a level of predictive power comparable to what has become possible for star formation. The sub-resolution BH models that will be developed will enable substantially more predictive BH modeling in galaxy-scale and cosmological simulations---thus alleviating arguably the largest uncertainty in current galaxy formation theories."
0.624088,"AST-1108700<br/>Cen<br/><br/>Observations indicate that the cosmological reionization history may be quite complex, and to understand at a fundamental level how the universe was reionized and what reionized it, requires a satisfactory understanding of the formation of galaxies during the reionization epoch. Current and future observations are, and will be, detecting many galaxies in the reionization epoch above redshift six, and interpreting this rich dataset will require a comprehensive theoretical framework for galaxies in halos of tens of millions to ten billion solar masses, constructed as much as possible ab initio and from first principles in the standard cold dark matter model. This research program will establish such a framework by carrying out ultra-high-resolution, cosmological, adaptive mesh refinement radiation-hydrodynamic simulations focusing on galaxies in the right mass range, combining a detailed physical treatment with sophisticated post-simulation analysis. The work will significantly advance the fields both of galaxy formation at high redshift and of cosmological reionization.<br/><br/>These research activities will be integrated into the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and will feed into an effective outreach program that improves the scientific understanding of the general public about cosmological research.

First, the transient boosting of a cluster's SZE signature due to cluster mergers may significantly complicate comparison of observed clusters to cosmological models. Second, measurement of cluster masses may introduce both systematic errors and bias. Finally, internal flows act as a contaminant to measurements of cluster peculiar velocities through the kinetic SZE, but are themselves an interesting observable. To maximize the impact of this research, all simulation results, in their entirety, will be available for use by the scientific community through the Simulated Cluster Archive. Research projects will be generated to involve undergraduate astrophysics majors, and the investigators will partner with an area high school via a university initiative that targets under-represented groups."
0.388477,"Cosmological phase transitions can be a copious source of topological defects. The same happens in condensed matter systems, and experiments on these systems can help in determining the mechanism for defect formation. The similarities between the superfluid transitions in liquid helium and cosmological models containing topological defects is especially strong. As a result, in recent years there has been considerable activity to simulate phase transitions of the early universe using liquid He-3 and <br/>He-4.<br/><br/>Previous experiments in both He-3 and He-4 have shown that defects, in this case vortices, are indeed created, and that the vortex line density is consistent with estimates based on the mechanism proposed by Zurek, now known as the Kibble-Zurek (K-Z) mechanism. This mechanism makes specific predictions about the scaling of the vortex line density with a) the rate at which the transition takes place and b) the amplitude of the correlation length of the order parameter. In earlier experiments there was little control over the former, while the latter, determined solely by the fluid, could not be changed appreciably either. Prof. Mulder's group will carry out a new experiment, operating close to the tricritical point in He-3 and He-4 mixtures, will have the ability to change both over a wide range. This should result in a definitive test of the K-Z mechanism.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities."

Galaxy disks are believed to form over an extended period of time, growing from the inside out. Star formation in the disk will convert gas to stars, perhaps also forming a bulge. However, this simple picture will not be non- axisymmetric instabilities.

0.392194,"ABSTRACT<br/><br/>AST-1108885<br/>Governato<br/><br/>Understanding the physical processes that shape the formation and evolution of galaxies is a fundamental question in modern astrophysics. This project will run simulations with high resolution and physical detail in a full Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological context, studying this problem with a strong emphasis on galaxy centers. The work focuses on three closely interconnected discrepancies between predictions of the CDM model and the observed evidence for i) dark matter cores at the centers of small galaxies, ii) the large fraction of bulgeless dwarfs, and iii) the existence of massive disk galaxies with very small (pseudo) bulges. The simulations share three common features: i) a simple yet physically motivated description of star formation, ii) gas outflows driven by energy feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes, and iii) star formation quenching by ultraviolet photons. These simulations will resolve the inner structure of galaxies down to fifty parsecs over the entire Hubble time. This approach will relate directly the spatial distribution and physical properties of the particles in the N-Body simulations to the quantities actually measured for real galaxies, using software to ""observe"" the models, including physical effects as well as the known properties of instruments, to create realistic artificial datasets.<br/><br/>This team has already used this approach to obtain seminal results on the formation of bulgeless galaxies with dark matter cores, and to simulate a cosmological set of galaxies that simultaneously reproduce the luminosity-size relation, the abundance of damped Lyman alpha systems, and the HI Tully-Fisher relation. Specific goals of this new work include understanding how gas outflows create dark matter cores at the centers of galaxies and predicting their size over a range of galaxy masses and merging and star formation histories, understanding the role of gas outflows, mergers and various dynamical instabilities in the central region of galaxies on the creation or suppression of stellar bulges and pseudo bulges, and predicting the observable photometric and kinematic properties of the baryonic mass distribution in galaxies.<br/><br/>The PI will collaborate with his institution's funded Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP), which helps underrepresented students in their transition to college and possibly to an astronomy major, providing them with academic advising and one to one mentorship while guiding them through research projects.

0.00584,"A program of research will be initiated to study plasmas in the early Universe, when general-relativistic effects due to the expansion of the background are significant. Plasma dynamics during this epoch could have important ramifications for the theory of galaxy formation and of the origin of intergalactic, and possibly also galactic, magnetic fields. The synthesis of general relativity and plasma physics is a field that is largely untouched, and the cosmological implications in particular are mostly unexplored. The simple linear theory of cosmological plasmas has been studied in the single-particle approximation and in the magnetohydrodynamic limit. A kinetic approach, based on the general-relativistic Boltzmann equation, will be carried out. In addition, some nonlinear analysis will be performed. However, for most nonlinear phenomena to be studied adequately, numerical simulation is necessary. Because the nonlinear, collective effects are among the most interesting, computer codes are being developed to investigate such effects. Many applications of these codes are underway or planned, including, but not limited to, the study of fluctuations in plasmas in the early Universe, the modeling of shock formation and heating due to mode interactions or to Alfven waves, and the investigation of the effect of dynamo and reconnection mechanisms on the origin of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields."

0.24,"Among the key predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the Universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for the goal of direct detection of gravitational waves, as the second generation of gravitational-wave detectors is commissioned at the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO). The sensitivity of the new aLIGO detectors will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. The aLIGO data will be used to search for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological gravitational wave sources. This specific award will support research that searches the aLIGO data to look for the background signals that arise from gravitational-wave signals from many independent sources. <br/><br/>The first observation data from aLIGO is expected in 2015, with the sensitivity and duty-cycle of the detectors steadily increasing over the following three years. This project focuses on the searches for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which arises from an incoherent superposition of gravitational-wave signals generated by many independent sources. The SGWB could be of cosmological origin: for example, in inflationary models the SGWB is generated just moments after the Big Bang, implying that the SGWB may contain unique information about the first moments in the evolution of the universe and about the physics of energy scales not accessible in laboratories. Similarly, the SGWB could be of astrophysical origin: for example, summing up contributions from all magnetars or from coalescences of all binary neutron stars and/or black holes in the universe leads to a stochastic gravitational-wave ""foreground"" that contains information about these most violent objects and events in the universe. <br/><br/>The SGWB searches with aLIGO data will be conducted using cross-correlation techniques that were developed and successfully used in the SGWB searches with initial LIGO data. The searches for isotropic SGWB are expected to result in a measurement about 1000x more sensitive than the current best upper limits. Similarly, the searches for anisotropic SGWB will result in about 100x more sensitive measurement than the current best upper limits. Such substantial advances will result in a series of interesting cosmological and astrophysical implications, including detection or new constraints on parity violation in the early universe, evolution of the universe during the first minute after the Big Bang, equation of state in neutron stars, rate of compact binary coalescences and its evolution with redshift."

0.25,"Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe and, therefore, are potent cosmological probes. Perhaps surprisingly, their baryonic (and observable) matter is principally in the hot, diffuse plasma located between the galaxies, i.e., the intracluster medium, not in luminous matter like stars. This intracluster medium is composed of thermal and nonthermal components. The thermal gas undergoes both cooling and heating (via feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei) in the central regions. The nonthermal component consists of cosmic rays, generated via shocks and active galactic nuclei, and magnetic fields.<br/><br/>Despite their importance, the nonthermal constituents have received relatively little study in part because of the challenges in the numerical modeling needed to follow the relevant physics. In an effort to begin to close this gap in our understanding of galaxy cluster environments, Dr. Burns and collaborators will apply their recently developed adaptive mesh refinement magnetohydrodynamic N-body code to the problem. Most notably, this new tool is capable of evolving both cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the large-scale cosmological environment. Here it will be employed to simulate both thermal and nonthermal processes within galaxy clusters. These simulations will iterated upon until convergence is achieved with a combination of thermal and nonthermal physics that best reproduces available observations. <br/><br/>Postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will be trained through active participation in all aspects of this work. The data from these simulations and the tools for converting the outputs into standard observational formats will be made available to the astronomical and broader community through an on-line archive.

In order to understand this discrepancy, it is necessary to understand whether the Milky Way and its dwarf galaxy populations are typical of large spiral galaxies, or if the Milky Way is itself an unusual galaxy. The investigators will identify dwarf galaxies around 50 spiral galaxies similar to the Milky Way. These systems will be compared to predictions to determine whether the Milky Way's dwarf population is typical, and will provide new insight into the nature of dark matter and into the formation of our own Galaxy.<br/><br/>The investigators work focuses on a key question of interest to the public: What is our place in the Universe?

0.222655,"AST 0205738<br/>Madau<br/><br/>In currently popular cosmological scenarios at very early times, the gas within protogalactic halos with masses comparable to those of present-day dwarf ellipticals experienced rapid cooling and fragmentation. These fragments formed massive stars , which in turn synthesized heavy elements, and exploded as Type II supernovae, enriching the surrounding medium. These subgalactic stellar systems then generated the ultraviolet radiation and mechanical energy that reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the cosmos. The history of the Universe during and soon after these crucial formative stages is recorded in the thermal state, ionization degree, and chemical composition of the all-pervading intergalactic medium (IGM). Throughout the epoch of structure formation, the IGM becomes clumpy under the influence of gravity, and acts as a source for the gas that accretes, cools, and forms stars within subgalactic fragments, and as a sink for the metal enriched material, energy, and radiation which they eject. The study of the gaseous and stellar content of the high-redshift Universe thus provides invaluable insight into this era and the basic processes that govern the collapse, cooling, and evolution of some of the earliest formed cosmological structures. This theoretical project will study the epoch of .first light, the astrophysics of protogalactic systems, the intergalactic medium and quasar absorbers in the context of current theories of galaxy formation. It will focus on a series of critical questions in each of these interrelated areas: (1) cosmological reionization, (2) the epoch of first light, and (3) protogalaxy halos, SN-driven winds, and the metal enrichment of the IGM. A coordinated approach will be pursued involving theoretical studies of the controlling physical processes, and direct numerical simulation of their effects within the current paradigm for structure formation.

0.018,"Zabludoff - Abstract Two of the fundamental questions in astronomy today are how structures form in the galaxy distribution and to what extent environment affects galaxy evolution. Surprising results from an on-going survey of five nearby galaxy clusters (Zabludoff et al. 1995) underscore the power of observing clusters of galaxies for data to understand these issues. The research will consist of observations of three unique, carefully chosen samples of clusters of galaxies and smaller groups of galaxies. The results from the observations will be used to, 1) to place stringent constraints on how clusters of galaxies form and on the cosmological mean mass density parameter Omega zero, 2) to isolate the contribution of the cluster environment to galaxy evolution, 3) to determine whether ""E+A"" galaxies, those strange objects with strong Balmer absorption lines but no line emission, are a link in the chain that connects blue spirals to ""SO"" galaxies, and 4) to uncover the shape of the faint-end galaxy luminosity function in clusters. Additional results from the reduction and interpretation of the data will include a better understanding of the causes of the Butcher-Oemler effect and of the evolution of the intracluster medium. The results of the observations of the three samples will be used to unravel the detailed evolutionary history of clusters and their galaxies. The results will provide invaluable baselines for future research, when compared with similarly extensive surveys of higher redshift systems underway with the new generation of large ground-based telescopes and NASA satellites . The results from the projects will not only yield answers to the important questions discussed above, but will also be the first and necessary step in the planning of the most extensive survey of nearby clusters and their galaxies ever conceived. Warrick Couch (Ang lo-Australian Observatory and Australia National University), Ian Smail (Carnegie Observatories), and Ann Zabludoff (Carnegie Observatories) are planning to use the Anglo- Australian Telescope's (AAT) 2DF multi-fiber spectrograph, with its 400 fibers, to observe 10,000-20,000 galaxies in approximately 50 rich clusters in a well defined, volume-limited sample. The completion of the 2DF project in the next five years is timed to match the completion of other major redshift surveys of galaxies (Las Campanas, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and AAT redshift surveys). To understand how all types of galaxies evolve, large statistical surveys like these, which sample comple mentary environments, are needed. The 2DF cluster survey will sample the far tail of the distribution of dense environments, regions which are strongly dependent on the conditions in the early universe and are thus powerful tests of cosmological models. The timing of the 2DF project will also coincide with promising new N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of large-scale structure formation (Evrard, Steinmetz, Lake, and others), with enough dynamic range to include tens of clusters per universe, while maintaining sufficient resolution to monitor the evolution of individual galaxies. For the first time, it will be possible to compare the details of cluster dynamics and cluster galaxy evolution directly with the predictions of theoretical cosmological models. ***"

Detailed analysis of the central few kiloparsecs of galaxies is the only way to settle the small-scale disagreement between observations and theoretical predictions in the standard cosmological model. The project will study complex gas and star motions in the central regions of galaxies using full-scale cosmological simulations with a zoom-in technique for resolving a few individual galaxies, plus separate evolution of 'disk plus bulge plus dark matter halo' systems. The researchers will also work to improve the analytical treatment of different effects relevant for modeling these central regions. This includes non-circular motions, triaxiality and asymmetry, changes in eccentricity, asymmetric drift corrections, and a multi-phase gas medium. Finally, this research includes observations to measure the different effects which complicate the modeling of galaxies, such as the magnitude and structure of non-circular motions, the contribution of the stellar component, and the rotation and velocity dispersion of the old stellar component.<br/><br/>Results of the work will be made available to the media, who have in the past made use of this team's images, and will be disseminated through public lectures.

This work therefore gives information about how mass is distributed on the largest cosmic scales. The team will explore better techniques for measuring the shapes of galaxy images. They will improve the performance of pipeline software for determining the point spread function (PSF, which measures the distorting effect of the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope optics on the images), and for measuring galaxy colors, and the distances inferred from those colors, even when the PSF differs between images in different colors. They will develop a method to find the combination of cosmological parameters that best fits a given set of such observations, while taking account of important systematic errors, and making use of all the available information in the survey images, but remaining computationally feasible. Finally, the team will explore the best combination of lensing measurements to test theories of modified gravity, which have been proposed as alternatives to dark energy in explaining the observed cosmic acceleration.

Combined with optical and near-infrared surface photometry, these data will be the basis for measurement of the total mass distribution within each galaxy. Stellar population synthesis estimates and detailed hydrodynamical modeling will determine the separation into baryonic and dark matter components. Extensive N-body simulations will test the stability of the models, sharpening the determination of the separate contributions of luminous and dark matter. After correction for the gravitational compression by the baryonic disk, the density, concentration, and circular speed of these halo models will be compared to the expected values derived from cosmological simulations. Discrepancies may suggest ways to improve and extend the physics in the galaxy formation simulations. A new analysis tool will measure non-axisymmetric patterns of motion in the two-dimensional kinematic maps of the galaxies, leading to a determination of the shapes of the dark halos. The investigators will also use Fabry-Perot observations of stellar absorption lines in early-type barred disk galaxies to determine the bar's rotation speed. As dynamical friction with the halo slows the bar's motion, this measurement will yield another constraint on the halo density in these galaxies. Sharpened by dynamical constraints, estimates for the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies aim to refine the poorly-known relation between mass-to-light and broad-band colors of disk galaxies.<br/><br/>Educationally, the proposing team will disseminate their results to the broader community through public lectures and in New Jersey schools.

0.093802,"Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is surrounded by dozens of smaller galaxies. These smaller galaxies are called dwarf galaxies. The properties of these dwarf galaxies provide clues to how galaxies form and can test the nature of dark matter. However, the number of Milky Way dwarf galaxies and their properties do not fully agree with well-established cosmological models. In order to understand this discrepancy, it is necessary to understand whether the Milky Way and its dwarf galaxy populations are typical of large spiral galaxies, or if the Milky Way is itself an unusual galaxy. The investigators will identify dwarf galaxies around 50 spiral galaxies similar to the Milky Way. These systems will be compared to predictions to determine whether the Milky Way's dwarf population is typical, and will provide new insight into the nature of dark matter and into the formation of our own Galaxy.<br/><br/>The investigators work focuses on a key question of interest to the public: What is our place in the Universe? They will integrate results into their array of education and outreach activities, bringing the excitement of this rapidly-advancing field to a wider audience. They will create a wiki to collect and disseminate teaching resources, with the goal of lowering the bar to introducing new practices into the undergraduate astronomy classroom. While development of innovative and interactive undergraduate material has accelerated, a survey of university-level science faculty suggests that only a small fraction of this makes it into the classroom. A single well-designed wiki which gathers innovative undergraduate astrophysics teaching resources from the professors who use them is lacking and will significantly increase the use of such material.<br/><br/>The investigators will constrain the distribution of dwarfs around Milky Way-mass galaxies (of which the Milky Way itself is a single example) by observationally identifying dwarf galaxy populations around at least 50 systems down to the luminosity of the Milky Way's Fornax dwarf galaxy (eight magnitudes fainter than the Milky Way). In parallel, they will construct a comprehensive theoretical framework based on cosmological dark matter simulations that fully utilizes the results of the observational program to provide insight into and place new constraints on models of galaxy formation and dark matter physics. Their goals are to: (1) provide the data and theoretical framework necessary to distinguish between the multiple proposed solutions to the ""missing dwarf"" and ""too big to fail"" problems and (2) provide an improved understanding of the Milky Way itself in a cosmological context."
0.434815,"The epoch before and during reionization is about to become accessible observationally through a combination of infrared and radio instruments and fine scale microwave background experiments. Understanding the nature of sources that reheated and reionized the intergalactic medium at the end of the dark ages is therefore crucial. This project will investigate the role of quasars in the high redshift Universe, combining ab initio cosmological simulations of quasar and galaxy formation and growth with high resolution radiative transfer to perform the first fully self consistent modeling of this epoch. The contribution of quasars through both thermal feedback and ionizing radiation, so far largely missing in theoretical predictions, is likely to dominate the early stages and substantially modify the large scale structure seen in neutral hydrogen. The simulations will reveal the complex interplay of pre-ionization by hard X-ray sources and the contribution of stellar sources, study the physical state of intergalactic gas, and make detailed physically motivated predictions of the number and character of radio sources.<br/><br/>These results have major implications for what is seen later, from quasars and supermassive black holes to the large-scale structure traced by dwarf galaxies. As the first observational studies of the dark ages are just on the horizon, being part of a new, emerging field will benefit the graduate student and undergraduates involved in the research. The results will be incorporated in an existing outreach program working with middle school students from underrepresented groups, and included in undergraduate coursework projects."
0.152797,"The current cosmological paradigm includes two significant and unknown physical entities called ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy,"" which are used to model the Universe as we know it. Understanding the distribution of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental problems in astronomy and is the focus of this project. There are many discrepancies between dark matter sub-structure in the existing computer simulations and in observations. There are too few massive satellites relative to simulations, and at low Galactic latitudes there are hardly any Milky Way satellites. This project aims to extract essential information on the dark matter distribution in spiral galaxies by building on the investigator's ongoing work in characterizing galactic satellites from analysis of disturbances in extended disks of hydrogen gas.<br/><br/>Communicating scientific results to a broad audience and promoting diversity benefits the astronomy community and our society at large. This project will be carried out at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), which has historically been primarily an undergraduate institution:<br/>(1) Women in Science: The PI will organize regular meetings with visiting women colloquium speakers, with the goal of gathering advice on professional development. Dr. Chakrabarti will also continue participating in the Expanding Your Horizons program, which is geared towards engaging middle school girls in science.<br/>(2) Computational Bootcamp: Every summer, the PI will provide a two-week, intensive computational bootcamp geared towards entering graduate students. The goal of this bootcamp is to serve as a bridge---providing an introduction to computational astrophysics, with hands-on lectures that illustrate the basics of computing and applications to astronomy. The PI will work through simple examples in IDL and Python, and she will encourage women and minority students to attend the bootcamp, and assign mentors for entering students.<br/>(3) Visualization Laboratory: The PI will continue producing 3-D animations of galaxy collisions, which will be showcased in the Viz-Lab at RIT. Three-D movies are becoming an increasingly popular tool to engage the public and are effective in widely disseminating research on galaxy evolution.<br/><br/>The PI will carry out the following technical tasks:<br/>(1) The Milky Way: By matching simulated orbits of the Milky Way satellites with HST proper motions and tidal debris, the PI will derive constraints on the orbital parameters, as well as the initial stellar (and dark matter) distribution of the Milky Way satellites. The PI will produce models that are consistent with both the HI and stellar data of our galaxy, which displays large ripples in the outskirts, a prominent warp, and vertical waves in the galactic disk.<br/>(2) Probing The Dark Matter Halo: Dark matter halos evolve as a function of time, and they may have complex shapes. The PI will determine if the inference of the halo potential from stellar streams is viable for time-varying potentials. By deconstructing the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation ERIS, the PI will study if the distribution of satellites and the morphology of the gas and stellar disk is representative of the Milky Way or local spirals.<br/>(3) Shaking and Rattling The Local Spirals: By simulating a wide range of encounters with sub-halos from cosmological simulations, and mapping to multiple observational constraints in a statistically robust manner using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis, the PI will produce realistic mock catalogs and evolutionary histories of HI disks and their satellite populations.<br/>(4) Strong Spiral Lenses in HI: As the SWELLS sample is a sufficiently low redshift sample of strong spiral lenses (z_avg ~ 0.1) showing visible signs of interaction, the PI will compare and contrast the team's HI analysis and gravitational lensing to derive two independent constraints on the dark matter distribution."
0.289966,"AST-0709498<br/>Knox<br/><br/>This project will develop, and apply to available data, the analysis algorithms necessary to reach confident conclusions about dark energy and cosmological parameters, from optical imaging surveys. Such surveys have great potential for addressing what may be the most intriguing question in fundamental physics, the origin of the observed acceleration of the cosmological expansion rate. Focusing initially on the Deep Lens Survey will ground the algorithm development in practical needs. The analysis will start with the two-point function of the shear and then extend to the highly significant information in higher-order correlations. Sources of uncertainty in inferences from imaging data are complex and can only be taken fully into account with numerical simulation. This challenge will be met by developing a Monte Carlo analysis framework, using cosmological simulations from collaboration with the Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br/><br/>The developed analysis framework will be directly useful for future ground- and space-based surveys, both underway and being planned, and may be applicable to a diversity of other experiments where numerical simulation plays a key role in the interpretation of data. In addition the training of junior researchers, the research will inform work with K-12 teachers through the Sacramento-based 'Science in the River City' program."
0.1548,"In a sufficiently small multiconnected universe one expects unusually weak broad-scale fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and that is exactly what the WMAP satellite has observed, at a confidence level of roughly 1-in-300 to 1-in-500. However, the mystery has deepened with the discovery of anomalies in the CMB. Specifically, the broadest fluctuations (the ell=2 and ell=3 modes) align in the direction of the cosmological dipole. Stranger still, radio and optical astronomers have independently observed unexplained anisotropies pointing in the same direction. While it would be premature to draw conclusions, dark matter is high on the list of candidates. Whatever the ultimate explanation, if the broad-scale CMB fluctuations turn out to be weaker than they seem, this will strengthen the case for a finite universe. The current project continues to develop the mathematics of the eigenmodes of finite universe candidates for better comparison with observations, while simultaneously trying to make sense of the anomalies in the data and to gauge their impact on topological conclusions. The educational half of the project is developing and expanding a suite of geometry and topology software, spanning the gamut from specialized research software (SnapPea) to widely used topology games for middle school students.<br/><br/>Speculation on the shape of the universe goes back to ancient times, but serious mathematical study of cosmic topology began in 1854 when Riemann proposed the hypersphere as a cosmological model. Topology blossomed in the late 19th century, leading to a variety of possible 3-dimensional spaces. The astronomer Karl Schwarzschild presented these models to the German Astronomical Society in 1900 as candidates for the topology of space, but given the limited observational data available at the time, he could conclude only that the universe must be much larger than our Milky Way galaxy. Indeed cosmic topology made little headway as an observational science until the 1990's when the COBE and WMAP satellites found hints of a finite universe in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The past decade has been a turbulent one, though, with intense work on hyperbolic models giving way to flat and spherical models to accommodate the 1998 discovery of dark energy. More recently the plot has taken a new twist, with features of the cosmic microwave background -- as well as some optical and radio anomalies -- all aligning in the direction of Virgo. This suggests some new physical effect -- perhaps dark matter -- which has not been previously accounted for. The research component of the present project applies geometrical and topological knowledge to the ongoing efforts to understand the shape and nature of our universe, while the educational component makes these breathtakingly beautiful ideas accessible to middle school, high school and college students (www.geometrygames.org)."

Detailed analysis of the central few kiloparsecs of galaxies is the only way to settle the small-scale disagreement between observations and theoretical predictions in the standard cosmological model. The project will study complex gas and star motions in the central regions of galaxies using full-scale cosmological simulations with a zoom-in technique for resolving a few individual galaxies, plus separate evolution of 'disk plus bulge plus dark matter halo' systems. The researchers will also work to improve the analytical treatment of different effects relevant for modeling these central regions. This includes non-circular motions, triaxiality and asymmetry, changes in eccentricity, asymmetric drift corrections, and a multi-phase gas medium. Finally, this research includes observations to measure the different effects which complicate the modeling of galaxies, such as the magnitude and structure of non-circular motions, the contribution of the stellar component, and the rotation and velocity dispersion of the old stellar component.<br/><br/>Results of the work will be made available to the media, who have in the past made use of this team's images, and will be disseminated through public lectures. The studies will train graduate students in the skills required to become independent researchers, and involve them in undergraduate teaching.

200.11,"The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is not just another telescope, but a new approach to survey science and data-based astronomy. Existing 6-meter to 10-meter ground-based telescopes all have relatively small fields of view and are operated in the traditional mode where a given project is pursued for a few nights at a time, after which different astronomers pursue data addressing a different scientific goal, possibly with a different instrument. Although this approach can make great advances, there are some crucial scientific problems that need to be tackled more like a physics experiment, whereby a dedicated instrument is used for a finite period of time to address well-defined objectives. This is the LSST: a large survey telescope using a wide field camera to image the accessible sky repeatedly to very faint limits over a ten-year period. The LSST data products will change every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to the large scale structure of the Universe.<br/><br/>LSST will map the inner and outer Solar System, study stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, reveal the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other local objects, find transient and variable objects at both low and high redshift, and survey the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. Turning to far-field cosmological topics, LSST will explore the properties of supernovae to redshifts around one, uncover strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and show how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.<br/><br/>LSST will be built on the El Peñón peak on Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. LSST will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view 9.6 square degrees, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 square degrees south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands at wavelengths from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r~27.5 magnitudes. LSST's three large mirrors are actively controlled to minimize distortion, and the telescope structure is especially compact and stiff to reduce image motion and to enable rapid travel across the sky, maximizing the observing duty cycle. The project is an interagency public-private partnership, with the Department of Energy accepting responsibility for the world-leading camera, while NSF as overall lead agency will support the site facility, the telescope, and the extensive and sophisticated data management. Private donations have supported initial construction work that significantly reduces project risk, including the innovative primary-tertiary mirror, early site work, and development of sensors for the camera. LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of raw data per night and an uncompressed data set for the full ten-year survey of some 200 petabytes. Dedicated facilities will process the image data in near real time.<br/><br/>The image archive and resulting catalogs will be widely and freely available. A sophisticated data management system will enable work ranging from simple queries from individual users to computationally intensive scientific investigations that could use the entire data set. The LSST Project is at the forefront of the information technology revolution and includes investments in technology, cyber-infrastructure, education, and outreach. With one of the largest scientific databases in existence, the LSST project presents challenging opportunities for research into database architecture and data mining. Education and public outreach programs are fully integrated with the research program and include engaging experiences for non-specialists, partnerships with museums, schools, and industry, and opportunities to challenge and encourage tomorrow's innovators."
0.24,"The nature of dark energy is one of the fundamental astrophysical questions of our time. This project will address the computing challenges of current and upcoming cosmological surveys which will seek to answer this question. The research activities will focus on weak gravitational lensing, in which the signal is the distortion of images of distant galaxies, caused by gravitational perturbations of photon paths as they travel through space. The interpretation of these data is a computationally intensive process: the shapes of the raw galaxy images must be accurately determined, taking into account correlated systematic effects such as distortions due to the atmosphere and telescope optics. For the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project, this process must be performed on-line on around one billion separate objects per night. Once these results are in hand, there is the further challenge of processing them: comparing theory to various statistics derived from the observations can give quantitative insight into fundamental aspects of the universe: its expansion history, the growth of structure, and the nature of the dark matter and dark energy which together make up 95% of the energy-content of the universe.<br/><br/>Great strides have been made in addressing the computational aspects of weak lensing measurement and analysis. Unfortunately, many current methods will have difficulty scaling to the size of future surveys. LSST will image the entire southern sky every three nights over the course of ten years, producing an astronomical database of unprecedented size. Analysis of these data will require the use of new database architectures with new, purpose-built parallel algorithms. The current project will address those issues by fostering a close link between computer science and the ""domain sciences"" like astronomy. The work will take place within the Database Research Group in the Computer Science& Engineering department at University of Washington (UW), with close ties to the Survey Science Group in the Astronomy Department at UW. This project will contribute fundamental results both in computational and astronomical science, mainly through the development of techniques within the new SciDB parallel data processing engine to address specific computational hurdles for cosmological research with LSST. This research is vital to the science goals of LSST: current methods will not scale to the size of the survey.<br/><br/>The impact of this research will reach beyond astronomy to other domain sciences. Many domain sciences are currently producing data at an increasing rate. Scientists in a variety of fields are beginning to see the need for close collaboration with computer scientists who have experience in the methods required to store, access, and process their data. At the same time, computer scientists who are pushing the limits of computation often lack access to datasets on which to test their methods. The PI will foster interdisciplinary connections by developing a seminar in data-intensive computing, geared toward graduate students in a broad array of disciplines. In addition the PI will build on his volunteer experience with Seattle's Pacific Science Center Science Communication Fellow program, which seeks forums for scientists to share their research with the broader public. Through ongoing involvement in this program, he will continue to share the exciting results of data-intensive astronomy with members of the community."

Unfortunately we are limited to directly measuring black hole masses in nearby galaxies. In order to fully understand the energetic impact of black holes at cosmological distances, we must instead use secondary indicators to estimate their masses. These so-called scaling relationships are fundamental to our knowledge of galaxies and black holes at high redshifts, but they remain poorly determined. The PI will perform a multiwavelength observational program that is targeted at removing many known sources of uncertainty and scatter among a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei with direct black hole mass measurements. The PI will (1) carry out a new reverberation mapping survey to measure black hole masses in 20 galaxies; (2) use integral field unit observations of the nuclear region to measure stellar dynamics; and (3) derive distances to the host galaxies using 21 cm spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This program will solidify the scaling relationships that are heavily used by the community for estimating black hole masses at cosmological distances and will pave the way for a significant leap forward in our understanding of galaxies and black holes throughout cosmic history.

Using redshift data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the proposing team will measure the projected two-point correlation function, the angular correlation function, and the surface density profile of galaxies in groups and clusters. They will model these statistics to constrain the density profile of galaxies in dark halos, using both analytic models and numerical models constructed from cosmological N-body simulations. (2) Extend the above analysis to higher redshift by using data from the new Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Modeling the correlation functions will reveal the recent evolution in the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos. (3) Refine the proposers' semi-analytic model for the evolution of dark matter subhalos under the influence of merging, improving the analytic prescription for mass loss and including the role of baryonic matter. (4) By comparing the improved halo model to the clustering statistics, constrain the star formation and star stripping efficiencies for galaxies merging with larger halos.

SNe Ia are crucial for identifying the nature of dark energy, one of the most important problems facing modern science, because they serve as one of the most direct and precise distance indicators in the Universe. The results of this study will improve the cosmological calibration of these critical tools, by trying to understand what affects their status as standard candles, notably the different types of progenitor systems, deviations from spherical symmetry, and interaction with circumstellar matter. One important outcome will be a comprehensive set of observationally verified first-principles multidimensional explosion models of SNe Ia. Identifying physical correlations among predicted and observed signatures of SNe Ia will be crucial for improving the accuracy of their calibration.<br/><br/>This work is an exceptional platform for introducing students to cross-disciplinary and multi-field science, through the many areas involved in studying SNe Ia, such as numerical methods, large-scale hydrodynamics and radiation transport simulations, observations, and cosmological applications.

We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estiimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications. In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of this project should have a substantial application to many other equations of this general type which play important roles in other parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>Einstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open questions in this area."

Measurements of these faint signals will determine key parts of the cosmological puzzle, among which are the energy scale of inflation and the masses of the neutrinos. Detecting these small signal levels is extremely challenging, and this program will help determine the best ways to accomplish such measurements.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this program include training of undergraduate students in research, and public release of simulations which will be useful to future CMB experiments."

0.199395,"This group will investigate how the light of newly-forming galaxies and the active nuclei of galaxies propagates through the intergalactic gas. They focus attention on a period that ended about a billion years into cosmic history, when the neutral intergalactic gas was ionized by the ultraviolet light of galaxies. To calculate how gas and dark matter came together to make the galaxies, the group will use hydrodynamic simulations. They will develop and refine their calculations to predict when a galaxy should form stars, or develop an active nucleus. Then, the photons emerging from the galaxy will be tracked using Dr. Li's 3-dimensional radiative-transfer code. That code will be improved to handle Lyman-alpha photons, ionization, and the effect of very small dust grains. The group will produce large mock catalogs of high-redshift galaxies and quasars that describe their emission from X-ray to millimeter wavelengths, and include the hydrogen lines at 21cm and Lyman alpha. <br/><br/>Two graduate students will be trained by participating in the research. The new radiative-transfer code, and the mock catalogs, will be made available to the astronomical community. Those catalogs summarize the predictions of our theories about how galaxies grow. This group and others will test those theories by comparing the catalogs with what is seen in current and planned deep surveys of distant galaxies. Both Dr. Li and Dr. Abel work at institutions with strong records in public outreach, and this project will yield attractive still images and movies to illustrate current ideas about galaxy formation."
0.565216,"The Principal Investigator and collaborators in this project will combine three sophisticated computer codes in order to simulate the properties of galaxies at redshifts around 2 (approximately 10 billion years ago). These codes are (1) Arepo, an unstructured-adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code based on Voronoi tessellations; (2) Sunrise, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that calculates spectral energy distributions from ultraviolet to millimeter wavelengths for galaxies with stellar and nonthermal sources modulated by scattering and absorption; and (3) Turtlebeach, a similar radiative transfer code that calculates molecular spectral line emission. The team will use these coupled codes to create a library of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated, evolving, and merging galaxies. They will then fold the resulting models through estimates of cosmological merger rates and merging histories obtained through semi-analytic and numerical methods. This strategy will make it possible to connect physical mechanisms operating on scales of tens of parsecs to observations from large-scale galaxy surveys. The goals of the project are (1) to construct a physically motivated unified model for the diverse ""zoo"" of high redshift galaxies, including galaxy populations expected to be discovered in deep surveys by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Herschel Space Telescope; (2) to assess the cosmological significance of the various high redshift galaxy populations, and determine the dominant contributors to cosmic stellar mass assembly and the far infrared background; and (3) to develop tools for observers based on a physical understanding of high-redshift galaxies and a critical assessment of the applicability of locally-calibrated diagnostics. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, who will be mentored and trained by the Principal Investigator. The proposers will make public for the community expected luminosity functions for ALMA, JWST and Herschel deep fields in advance of these surveys.

0.297577,"AST 0709191<br/>Quinn<br/><br/>Since the Oort comet cloud extends to 1/3 the distance to the nearest stars, there is a strong connection between the galactic environment and the evolution of this cloud. Indeed the spike in semi-major axis distribution of observed new comets is due to the more significant torquing of more distant comets by passing stars and the Galactic tide as a whole. Given this connection, changes in the Galactic environment due to the orbit of the Sun in the Galaxy and drifting of the Sun from its formation environment will have significant effect on the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud and the subsequent delivery of those comets to the inner Solar System.<br/><br/>In this research program, Dr. Thomas Quinn and colleagues will first study the formation and evolution of the Oort Cloud over the 4.5 billion years of the Solar System's history assuming a number of different star forming environments. It is quite likely that the Sun formed in a dense stellar cluster, but the actual densities and timescale for leaving the cluster are uncertain. The work will consider a number of stellar densities and cluster dissipation timescales and compare the resulting Oort Cloud and subsequent comet shower strength with a control case with no cluster environment. The Solar System, however, does not occupy a static place within the Galaxy. The research will therefore go on to incorporate changes in Galactic perturbations as the orbit of the Sun in the Galaxy evolves. This will be accomplished in the context of a cosmologically motivated model of the Galaxy formed via hierarchical merging in a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) Universe. This model has been calculated using the research group's massively parallel cosmological code, GASOLINE, and the model has been shown to produce many observed characteristics of spiral galaxies. The evolution of the Oort Cloud will be calculated as it feels the perturbations of the gas, stars, and dark matter from the disk, spiral arms and other substructure that exists in the galaxy model. The study will pay particular attention to the subsequent changes to the comet flux into the inner Solar System and possible consequences for impact rates on the Earth.<br/><br/>Ever since the connection was made between the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous and a comet impact, a strong connection has been made between comets and the disciplines of Paleontology and Geology. Both Dr. Quinn and the graduate student supported on this award are part of the University of Washington's Astrobiology program and therefore, will be connecting their research to work done by biologists and geologists in that program. The connection between orbital dynamics and comets also engages the public at large. The issues of the origin of our planetary system, how it fits into the galaxy as a whole and the implications for life are issues that draw the public into the results of dynamical research.

1.0,"This project will develop novel theoretical methods and algorithms for clustering massive datasets with applications to astronomy, neuroscience and natural language processing. Clustering is the process of creating groups of data based on similarities between individual data points. The developed theoretical methods will be used in applications where clustering algorithms are critical and the input data is extremely large. First, new clustering algorithms will be designed to scale and will allow for better cosmological simulations. The simulations involve billions of particles in each snapshot, and existing clustering algorithms based upon a simple friends-of-friends approach do not scale to these cardinalities. Second, this project will advance the computational capabilities in statistical neuroscience by employing clustering algorithms to discover both regular patterns and anomalies in normal and abnormal brain graphs. Finally, this research will explore the important topic of finding anomalies in massive text streams, such as Twitter. In this setting, one is concerned with detecting anomalous bursts in traffic content that share a similar pattern. These bursts might signal an important political event or a natural disaster. This project will support undergraduate and graduate research aimed at developing skills needed for algorithmic work on massive data sets.<br/><br/>There exist numerous heuristics and approximation algorithms for many variants of the clustering problem. However, these methods are often slow or infeasible for applications with massive datasets. This research will improve space and time upper bounds for clustering algorithms in the streaming model. This project will address the k-mean and k-median problems in the dynamic streaming model, extend the results on separable data when the input comes from Euclidian space, improve the bounds in the sliding window model, combine the coresets technique with novel sampling approaches and the method of smooth histograms. The PIs' previous work has already been applied to natural language processing and this project will expand this direction further and explore the important topic of ""First Story Detection."" Furthermore, this research will explore the similarities and differences between various sampling and sketching techniques, and how they could be used in large multidimensional astronomical databases, like SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) SkyServer. These novel approaches will provide major speedups for the execution of large statistical aggregate queries. The new streaming algorithms will be used to find substructure in very large cosmological N-body simulations. <br/><br/>For further information see the project web site at: http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vova"

But CDM theory is still at odds with the observed properties of galaxies on scales where the baryonic physics of gas cooling, star formation and feedback are important. Modeling these processes in the cosmological context is extremely difficult owing to the immense dynamic range and resolution needed, and requires the most advanced computational hardware available as well as new computing techniques and algorithms. The proposing team has developed smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes addressing these processes at the galaxy scale, and plans to adapt their algorithms to new architectures in order extend them to cosmological volumes. In addition to moving their star formation and feedback algorithms from legacy message-passing interface (MPI) codes to a parallel language (CHARM++), they intend to implement faster algorithms that can achieve the needed dynamic range and take full advantage of the hundreds of thousands of processing cores on the Blue Waters system. The results will be processed by a parallel pipeline that creates simulated observations.

A full determination of many aspects of the history of the universe requires a comprehensive understanding of this dust-enshrouded galaxy population, and although enormous progress has been made, there are still many areas of uncertainty. One difficulty arises with galaxies with no known radio or X-ray counterpart, whose distance (redshift) cannot be measured because their location on the sky is only poorly known. The new Sub-millimeter Array telescope will be able to provide accurate positions and thus to fix this problem. In addition, the paucity of information about faint sources will be addressed with deep sub-millimeter observations in a region of the sky that has both current and planned data in various other wavelength regions.

SNe Ia are crucial for identifying the nature of dark energy, one of the most important problems facing modern science, because they serve as one of the most direct and precise distance indicators in the Universe. The results of this study will improve the cosmological calibration of these critical tools, by trying to understand what affects their status as standard candles, notably the different types of progenitor systems, deviations from spherical symmetry, and interaction with circumstellar matter. One important outcome will be a comprehensive set of observationally verified first-principles multidimensional explosion models of SNe Ia. Identifying physical correlations among predicted and observed signatures of SNe Ia will be crucial for improving the accuracy of their calibration.<br/><br/>This work is an exceptional platform for introducing students to cross-disciplinary and multi-field science, through the many areas involved in studying SNe Ia, such as numerical methods, large-scale hydrodynamics and radiation transport simulations, observations, and cosmological applications.

0.02,"The standard model of particle physics has been very successful in predicting how weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions behave up to energies so far accessible at present accelerators (1 TeV at the Tevatron at Fermilab in Chicago). However many fundamental questions are not addressed in the standard model and the standard model does not incorporate the fact that the neutrino, the lightest particle of spin 1/2, has a small mass. Two candidates for explaining some of the puzzles that exist are extending the standard model by doubling the number of particles via using a Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, which adds a particle of integer spin to every particle of 1/2 integer spin. Thus associated with the electron, which has spin 1/2, would be a scalar particle (0 spin) called the selectron. (This particle has not yet been found). Another approach is to assume our world is a lower dimensional surface (or membrane) in a higher dimensional space. This proposal by two groups, one at the Bartol Research Institute led by Qaisir Shafi and one at the Center for Theoretical Physics at the British University in Cairo, Dr. S. Khalil is to enable four Scientists from each institution to visit the other institution each year in order to foster their collaborative research on Large Hadron Collider related physics. As further ""glue"" for the collaboration the proposal is for a Post-doc to be hired at the Center for Theoretical Physics to work full time on the proposed project. The two teams will investigate both types of extensions of the standard model. This investigation is very important because next year at CERN in Geneva Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will start operation and will hopefully find new phenomena that will suggest what the extensions of the Standard Model should be. Other ways of accessing the highest energies come from astrophysical observation of the cosmic background radiation, and by understanding the cosmological implications of extensions of the standard model. More specifically, this group of scientists intends to investigate supersymmetric extensions of the SM and their potential signatures at colliders, in Astrophysical observations and cosmological implications. In particular they intend to study the question of whether Supersymmetry can significantly modify the CP asymmetry in B-decays compared to the SM picture. They also plan to perform a complete analysis for the minimal extension of the SM gauge symmetry that can accommodate the phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations, which has been confirmed by many experiments. The broader implications of this are many. The exchange of students will be an excellent cross-cultural experience for the students. Scientists trained in different cultures often have different ways of approaching solving a problem. The training of a young post-doc in Egypt who will interact strongly with the American scientists involved will enhance the training of this person and strengthen High Energy Physics research in Egypt. The partnership between the Physicists at Bartol and the Center for theoretical physics has been very fruitful in the past and its continuation would be very fruitful for advances in the field.

Improvements will include an approximation to follow the formation and destruction of dust and hydrogen molecules, and thus determine the gas cooling as the gas temperature drops below 10,000 K. This approximation will be tested and adjusted by comparing simulations with isolated Milky-Way-like galaxies and dwarf systems. The code will then be used to examine when star formation is quenched in the lowest-mass dark halos, leaving them without any stars to form a visible galaxy.

Some of these events have rather shallow light curves resembling other events like SN 1993J with rather different spectral evolution and some have steeper light curves. This may give clues to the nature of the collapse, clumping, mixing, and explosion of these events. Also to be continued is the program of supernova polarimetry, which promises critical information concerning the nature of the ejecta and of the circumstellar environment. Preliminary results are that Type Ia supernovae are unpolarized, implying a nearly spherical ejecta and very little circumstellar scattering, but that Type II, and perhaps all collapse events, have finite polarization, implying substantial asymmetries in the ejecta or circumstellar matter. Finally, the observational program includes three supernova search programs, one a visual search for nearby bright supernovae with the newly dedicated Supernova Search Telescope, one at redshifts of Z about 0.1 to determine possible galaxy evolution effects, and one deep survey at Z about 1 to constrain cosmological models. The observing program will be complemented with coordinated theoretical investigations. These will include multi-dimensional models of thermonuclear explosions, including deflagration flames and detonation structure and stability and gravitational collapse with multi-dimensional and multi-energy group neutrino transport. Also computed will be the spectral evolution of models to compare with observations.

0.286882,"AST 0507713<br/>Rickett<br/><br/>The objectives of this project, led by Dr. Barney Rickett, are: (1) to determine the angular structure of some very compact radio sources; (2) to measure the small-scale turbulence in the interstellar plasma; and (3) to study the propagation of waves through turbulent media. These objectives<br/>are quite disparate areas of science, related by the radio scattering methods that will be employed in the work. As the radio signals from quasars and pulsars travel toward the Earth, they suffer scattering analogous to the twinkling of starlight in the Earth's atmosphere, except that the cause is fluctuations in the density of the interstellar plasma. Though this scattering hampers the direct study of the quasar or pulsar, it provides a probe of the interstellar plasma and a method of measuring very small structure in the source. In its simplest form it is based on the familiar observation that stars twinkle and planets don't - because planets have a larger angular size than stars and this smoothes out the twinkling. The sources that will be studied with these techniques are particularly interesting for different reasons. One is the recently discovered double pulsar binary system J0737-3039. This system is a remarkable laboratory for studies of gravitational physics and pulsar magneto-spheres. Dr. Rickett's studies will help realize the potential for gravitational and magnetospheric studies. Another class of source is the so-called ""intra-day variable."" These are active galactic nuclei which are so compact that they must be incredibly bright, in fact so bright<br/>that they come very close to the ""inverse Compton limit."" Dr. Rickett's studies will help determine if indeed the inverse Compton limit is violated. Some of the scattering techniques are mature and need only refinement, whereas others, such as the ""parabolic arcs"" recently discovered in pulsar spectra, have great promise but are still in their infancy. The development of these techniques is an important part of this work. This includes the development of digital simulation tools to study cases which are analytically intractable. The microstructure of the interstellar plasma is not well understood and measurements have been for the most part restricted to one dimension, but new techniques have already started to provide a two dimensional view and this will be pursued vigorously.<br/><br/>The work impacts several areas of astronomy: pulsars; gravitation; extra-galactic sources; and interstellar medium. The development of techniques, particularly digital simulations, will also have a broad impact outside astronomy, including the solar wind plasma, and wave propagation in the atmosphere and in the ocean.

Einstein's field equations, besides providing the best current description of the behavior of gravitational physics on the astrophysical and cosmological scales, is also the source of a rich collection of mathematically interesting questions. This project seeks support for a program of research which focuses on some of these. Part of the aim of this proposed work is to increase the interaction of ideas and tools in mathematics and theoretical physics."
0.281775,"Dr. Bolte is measuring the luminosity function of galaxies (GLF) in the nearby Universe; in other words, determine the distribution of galaxies by luminosity. He is using very wide field CCDs to image individual member galaxies in two nearby galaxy groups: Leo and Coma I. Once we can define the current GLF we can better interpret various cosmologies. All cosmologies that forma galaxies from post-recombination density fluctuations in the early Universe predict an initial GLF. Knowledge of the distribution of galaxies by luminosity and mass in the current day Universe is required to interpret the data at different epochs in the evolution of the Universe. He is imaging the GLF to luminosities near those of the lowest dwarf spheroidal galaxies (with absolute magnitudes in the R-band of -9.5) in the Local Group.

This large problematic has been narrowed by three limits, each with its own particular logic: (1) Eight disciplines, chosen for their centrality to traditional scientific culture or for their uncommon popularity during the period in question, are targeted for study: language philosophy, logic-epistemology, hermeneutics, literary theory, law, astronomy, medicine, and ritual science; (2) In order to gain a better understanding of the variety of social<br/>and political contexts for precolonial science, knowledge production in the eight disciplines are to be examined in four distinct regional centers: Delhi/Varanasi; Navadvip (Bengal)/Mithila; Thanjavur/Madurai; Maharashtra; (3) The science that found expression in Sanskrit, the premier language of learning outside the Persianate order, is considered. <br/><br/>After conducting a systematic census of manuscripts and published works in the disciplines, team members select manuscripts preserved in South Asia (and to a lesser degree Europe and the U.S.) for collection and archival preservation. Prosopographical data from unpublished sources as well as from published editions and all relevant secondary scholarship is sifted and entered into a database. This is a version of FileMaker Pro modified for networked data entry and for specific project needs. A small number of major texts are chosen for study according to a uniform analytic matrix. These address, among other things: key problematics; principal disciplinary positions; tenets of the author or school in question; dominant modes of argument, evidence, and method. On the basis of the census of texts, the bio-biographical database, and text-analyses, team members plan a book of essays on the character of Indian scientific and scholarly knowledge and its social<br/>setting. Both the database and the manuscript archives (with links to the database) are to be available to the public on the IKS Website, in hopes that the database can be enriched even beyond the limits of the IKS project, to become a key tool of Indian studies. Comparative histories of Indo-Persian and eventually European science are initiatives built into the logic and structure of the IKS project."
0.328505,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>Dr. Wechsler and her team will explore how hydrogen gas is re-ionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the earliest stars and active galactic nuclei, and how that affects star formation in small galaxies. The standard Cold Dark Matter cosmologies predict many more low-mass dark halos, clumped around much larger dark halos, than we observe as satellites of larger galaxies. But ultraviolet radiation from the larger galaxy may prevent gas in the smallest satellite dark halos from collapsing to form stars, so that no galaxy is born there. Dr. Wechsler's work will improve on current studies, which assume that the entire cosmos reionizes at a single time. She and her team would first run large cosmological N-body simulations including only the dark matter. They will then examine how changing the level of ultraviolet radiation alters the number of infalling subhalos that could host faint satellite galaxies. The team will then use the large-scale simulations, together with models for reionization, to estimate the range of possible ultraviolet radiation levels around a galaxy like our Milky Way. The calculations will predict how patchy reionization affects the expected satellite population of Milky-Way-sized galaxies, and examine what relations exist between a galaxy's reionization history and its satellite population, formation process, and environment.<br/><br/>A Hispanic postdoc and a graduate student will be trained as they participate in the research. Students from under-represented groups in a program at Dr. Wechsler's institution will also be involved.

0.362384,"The object of this proposal is the analysis of existing methods, and the development of new ones, for the task of multi-manifold learning, where the data is assumed to be comprised of low-dimensional structures. The main focus will be in studying the potential of spectral methods for clustering and modeling of low-dimensional surfaces embedded in high dimensions; in designing new spectral-based approached to the task of detection of low-dimensional objects in point clouds; and the analysis of popular manifold learning algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers. A number of applications will be specifically addressed, for example, motion segmentation, structure from motion, classification of face images, segmentation of diffusion tensor images and the characterization of cosmological models in astrophysics. <br/><br/>Modern high-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional structures. Such situations arise in image processing; e.g., in target tracking, where a typical trajectory defines a curve through successive frames; and also in medical imaging, e.g., in the examination of vascular networks. The study of the galaxy distribution, which contains filamentary and sheet-like structures, is another example. Traditional methods are known to be ineffective in this context and the last decade has seen a massive amount of research aiming at improving on these classical tools. A number of approaches for multi-manifold modeling have been suggested, mostly by computer scientists and engineers. Applied mathematicians and statisticians have different perspectives to <br/>offer and their contribution is needed, not only in designing new algorithms but also (and perhaps especially) in providing theoretical foundations, which researchers in the field have been asking for. The research in this proposal will address both issues, developing rigorous mathematical theory combined with carefully designed numerical strategies addressing specific applications, such as motion segmentation, structure from motion, classification of face images, medical imaging and the characterization of cosmological models in astrophysics.

0.074295,"Abstract - Ma AST 9973461<br/><br/>A concerted observational and theoretical effort to investigate the distribution of luminous and dark matter in superclusters of galaxies will be carried out. The studies of superclusters are of fundamental importance because they provide information about how light traces mass and how the mass-to-light ratio varies on the little explored distance scales of 10 Megaparsec and greater. Robust measurements of the mass-to-light ratio on such large scales are also more likely to give a representative value for the fundamental parameter, Omega, that is important in deducing the matter density of the universe. The technique of observing gravitational lensing effects may be used to study the distribution of matter in the Universe, and this research project will be one of the first attempts to apply the gravitational lensing method on supercluster scales.<br/><br/>The research has three components: (1) Data acquisition via optical wavelength observations. In order to maximize the feasibility of detecting gravitational lensing signals, the 10-meter Keck telescope in Hawaii will be used to obtain high-quality images and spectra of two carefully chosen superclustering fields; (2) Data analysis of the observations in both the strong lensing (gravitational arcs) and weak lensing (correlated distortion in images of background galaxies) regimes will be used to construct the mass density maps; (3) A theoretical study of systematic effects and the dependence of lensing signatures on cosmological parameters will be carried out. Numerical simulations, on supercomputers, of various plausible cosmological models will be performed to quantify the level of contamination due to intervening mass fluctuations in the lower-density intra-cluster regions of superclusters. These numerical simulation results will be used to allow the statistically significance of the observational results to be assessed."
0.1386,"9803362 Adams Hyperbolic 3-manifold theory has had a tremendous impact on the field of low-dimensional topology. Outstanding conjectures have fallen, one after the other, with the application of hyperbolic techniques. There has been a shift in the entire approach to low-dimensional topology, as researchers now use rigid geometric arguments to prove topological theorems. The two principal investigators intend to continue their research, both individually and jointly, on the theory and computation of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Through a set of projects, many relying heavily on their ability to compute explicit examples on a computer, the researchers plan to further the understanding of the connections between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the invariants that come out of hyperbolic 3-manifold theory, and the traditional topological invariants in 3-manifold theory. They will also consider applications of 3-manifold theory to cosmological models of the spatial universe, working in conjunction with cosmologists. Undergraduates will be involved in original research projects related to this research. A 2-dimensional surface may have positive curvature like a sphere, zero curvature like a flat Euclidean plane, or negative curvature like a saddle. Almost all surfaces can be given negative curvature, meaning that locally, they behave like the hyperbolic plane discovered by Lobachevsky, Gauss, and Bolyai in the last century. An analogous understanding of finite 3-dimensional spaces eluded researchers for decades, but in the mid-1970's W. P. Thurston conjectured that 3-manifolds, the analog of 2-dimensional surfaces one dimension up, can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of eight geometries. He proved the conjecture for vast quantities of 3-manifolds. By far the most commonly occurring geometry for 3-manifolds is hyperbolic geometry. The resulting ""hyperbolic structures"" are rich and have been used to solve a great many topological and geometrical questions. T he present project continues this work both theoretically and computationally. The theoretical advances make the computations possible, and the explicitly computed examples guide the further development of the theory. In the past year the project has found a new and very exciting application. The spatial universe within which we live is an example of a 3-manifold. Data from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) may, in the year 2001, reveal the spatial universe to be finite in extent. If so, algorithms from the present project will be used to determine the exact shape of the universe. The investigators are currently extending their software to tolerate the high levels of noise that will be present in the MAP data, and to handle the spherical and Euclidean cases as well as the hyperbolic one. Preliminary data suggests the real universe is hyperbolic, but the other possibilities cannot yet be ruled out. ***"

We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estiimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications. In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of this project should have a substantial application to many other equations of this general type which play important roles in other parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>Einstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open questions in this area."
0.135,"This project will use computer simulations to explore the consequences of gravitational collapse and the formation of black holes and spacetime singularities. The small scale structure of general singularities will be studied in detail. In particular the suitability of such singularities as precursors for the initial singularity of the big bang will be explored. Simulations will also be done of the interior of a black hole to see whether the inner horizon of the black hole is replaced by a null singularity. Simulations will also be done of critical gravitational collapse and of gravitational collapse with a negative cosmological constant.<br/><br/>The simulations of gravitational collapse as a possible precursor of the Big Bang are a promising approach to the question of ""where did the universe come from?"" Critical gravitational collapse is analogous to phase transitions in condensed matter physics and thus points to deep connections between two very different areas of physics. Gravitational collapse with a negative cosmological constant is connected through the so called AdS/CFT correspondence to such diverse physical systems as colliding heavy ion beams and high temperature superconductors."
0.13666,"Phenomena relating to microscopic (quantum) effects which occur during and after the formation of a black hole will be studied. The results will test predictions made using simple models in which the black hole exists in one space dimension and may provide insight into the important question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms. If a system of very cold atoms called a Bose-Einstein condensate has its properties configured correctly, then quantum effects will occur which are in some important ways similar to those which occur for black holes. The difference is that Bose-Einstein condensates can be studied in the laboratory. An investigation of such systems will be made with the goal of making predictions for effects that could be observed in the laboratory. The validity of an important approximation called the semiclassical approximation that is used as a bridge between macroscopic (classical) and microscopic (quantum) phenomena will be studied in two cases. One is the effect of particle production on the dynamics of the universe for an important model in which the universe begins by contracting and later expands. The other is for the effect of particle production on a strong electric field. One or more graduate students and probably some undergraduates will participate in some aspects of the research, continuing a long history of their training in numerical and analytical research techniques and co-authorship on publications. <br/><br/>The research proposed will investigate questions related to the information about how a black hole forms; the existence of quantum effects in analog black hole systems related to the existence of a horizon, which can be observed in laboratory studies; and the validity of the semi-classical approximation in certain cases where quantum effects are significant. In the case of black hole evaporation the objectives include determining the importance of quantum effects in the interior of a black hole and investigating the details of particle production in the exterior region during gravitational collapse to form a black hole, in order to gain insight into the question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms and to check the accuracy of similar calculations in two dimensional dilaton theories of gravity. For Bose-Einstein condensates, which can serve as analogs for black holes, the goal is to determine whether undulations or other new observable effects that require the existence of a horizon are predicted to occur. The validity of the semiclassical approximation will be studied for one important model (de Sitter space) in which the contraction is to a minimum size and is followed by an expansion. Numerical computations of the stress-energy of quantum fields will be made in the black hole and cosmological investigations and in the cosmological case the backreaction on the spacetime geometry will be computed."

In this project the fellow will continue his study of the formation and evolution of massive elliptical galaxies. Specifically, this project has the following aims: (1) The fellow will use 2D stellar kinematics from VIRUS-P and orbit-based, axisymmetric dynamical modeling to constrain the DM halo mass, the DM central density, the stellar orbital anisotropy and stellar abundance gradients. From this he will be able to place direct constraints on the timescales and possible mechanisms of galaxy formation.

(3) The fellow will bring his experience with the commissioning of the VIRUS-P spectrograph, and his detailed study of the instrument's fiber optics, in order to successfully install a duplicate instrument on the DuPont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. He will then use this instrument to expand his current galaxy sample into the Southern Hemisphere.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.

0.299338,"The objective of this program is to advance understanding in algebra, group theory, representation theory and combinatorics, with particular emphasis on the mathematics underlying physics and geometry. Almost all finite dimensional semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras occur in space-time symmetries and the development of the Standard Model of particle physics, which could not have progressed without an understanding of symmetries and group transformations. Infinite dimensional generalizations, known as Kac-Moody algebras and their associated groups, naturally form two distinct classes, namely affine and hyperbolic. By the 1980's the class of affine Kac-Moody algebras was shown to have wide applications in physical theories such as elementary particle theory, quantum field theory, gauge theory, conformal field theory, gravity and string theory. Recently many properties of hyperbolic Kac-Moody groups and algebras have been discovered in high-energy physics, though the full mathematical structure of these objects and certain aspects of the physical settings are not well understood. Moreover, mathematical proofs of the correspondences with physical theories are lacking or incomplete, and fundamental questions about the structure of hyperbolic algebras and groups remain open. This in part serves as motivation for our current and proposed work. Fundamental questions about the structure of hyperbolic Kac-Moody groups and algebras remain unanswered. The proposal addresses these questions directly using all available mathematical techniques. Our work also involves a number of mathematical questions about hyperbolic Kac-Moody groups and algebras that are motivated by the discovery of Kac-Moody symmetry in M-theory, supergravity and dimensional reduction, solutions of multidimensional gravity and cosmological billiards. The research proposed is in line with the following long term goals: to draw parallels between Kac-Moody groups, automorphism groups of discrete and continuous buildings, Lie theory, representation theory and automorphic forms, to find a classical interpretation of hyperbolic Kac-Moody groups, to use the geometry of Lorentz space and the methods of C*-algebras and noncommutative geometry to study Kac-Moody groups, to build a mathematical framework for studying recent discoveries of Kac-Moody symmetries in physics. Our recent work and proposal incorporates a range of mathematical techniques including group theory, algebra, representation theory, analysis, geometry, arithmetic and combinatorial methods, as well as the interactions between these subjects.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The objective of this program is to advance understanding in algebra, group theory, representation theory and combinatorics, with particular emphasis on the mathematics underlying physics and geometry. We are studying infinite dimensional generalizations of the finite dimensional symmetries, known as Lie groups and Lie algebras, which occur in space-time symmetries and the development of the Standard Model of particle physics, and are widespread in their roles in diverse areas of mathematics. Infinite dimensional generalizations, known as Kac-Moody structures, naturally form two distinct classes, namely affine and hyperbolic. By the 1980's affine Kac-Moody symmetries were shown to have wide applications in physical theories such as elementary particle theory, quantum field theory, gauge theory, conformal field theory, gravity and string theory. Recently many properties of hyperbolic Kac-Moody symmetries have been discovered in high-energy physics, though the full mathematical structure of these objects and certain aspects of the physical settings are not well understood. Moreover, mathematical proofs of the correspondences with physical theories are lacking or incomplete, and fundamental questions about the structure of hyperbolic Kac-Moody symmetry structures remain open. The proposal addresses these questions directly using all available mathematical techniques. Our work also involves a number of mathematical questions about hyperbolic Kac-Moody structures that are motivated by the discovery of Kac-Moody symmetry in M-theory, (the proposed unification of 5 string theories), supergravity and dimensional reduction, solutions of multidimensional gravity and cosmological billiards. Our objective is to strengthen the mathematical framework for studying these physical applications, and to identify and explore problems in algebra and geometry that are of relevance to the development of high-energy contemporary physics."

0.176226,"AST 98-70151 Matthias Steinmetz The PI is studying galaxy interactions and galaxy mergers. Galaxy interactions and mergers can induce radical changes in the appearance of galaxies, and also may be the defining events for the star formation history in those galaxies. The PI is using the hardware tool called GRAPE to run n-body simulations of interactions and mergers. These simulations address (1) What is the most likely dynamical pre-history for ellipticals? In particular, which fraction of them have formed from major mergers? And (2) What are the cumulative effects of tidal interactions and minor mergers for a typical disk galaxy? That is, what are the observable consequences of 'field harassment'? Several factors have come together that promise significant progress in answering these questions. There are numerical, high-resolution simulations of large scale structure that provide sensible initial conditions for galaxy merger. There are definite predictions for the mass profile of the dark and the luminous matter. Ultra-high resolutions simulations using GRAPE hardware make merger simulation surveys now feasible that involve a million particles each. With new modeling techniques the PI is attempting to constrain the orbital anisotropies in elliptical galaxies. The result of the project will be a set of simulated interaction histories for an ensemble of elliptical and spiral galaxies suitable for comparing with observations. ***"

A variety of cosmological processes have imprinted the CMB radiation with faint polarization signals, including Thomson scattering, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves released during inflation. Measurements of these faint signals will determine key parts of the cosmological puzzle, among which are the energy scale of inflation and the masses of the neutrinos.

However, their use in constraining cosmological parameters in future surveys is currently limited by large systematics errors. Errors in weak lensing shear measurements need to improve by an order of magnitude, and masses determinations of clusters of galaxies need reliable corrections for non-virialized structures. This project intends to combine observational measurements of weak lensing in galaxy clusters with realistic simulations of weakly lensed images with the goal of gaining sufficient understanding of the above systematic errors to allow weak lensing and cluster mass studies to lead to precise and reliable measurements of cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>Specifically, the investigators plan the following: (1) Building on previous success from the Bullet Cluster study, to use known cluster mergers and search for unknown ones to determine whether gravity at large distances really does follow an inverse square force law. The intent is to rule out models of gravity ""mixed"" with part classical and part alternative. (2) To use four different techniques on a sample of clusters, chosen to be close to virial equilibrium, to determine clusters masses and determine their consistency. This intent is to provide correction factors and/or statistics to identify any biased or problematic techniques and to identify and eliminate problem clusters from existing catalogues for the entire scientific community. (3) To combine observational measurements with simulations to what precision a point spread function (PSF) can be determined in all parts of an image.

The polarization of the CMB results from bulk motions of material at the time of the plasma-neutral transition, and the polarization measurements are the next frontier of CMB research, offering both the opportunity to make crucial tests of the standard cosmological model, and fresh insights which will lead beyond it. The instrument will make polarization measurements that are complementary to another existing experiment (BICEP = Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization), and will potentially allow the defining of inflationary gravity waves, an important signature of fundamental physics and of the early evolving universe."

0.541076,"The Principal Investigator and collaborators in this project will combine three sophisticated computer codes in order to simulate the properties of galaxies at redshifts around 2 (approximately 10 billion years ago). These codes are (1) Arepo, an unstructured-adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code based on Voronoi tessellations; (2) Sunrise, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that calculates spectral energy distributions from ultraviolet to millimeter wavelengths for galaxies with stellar and nonthermal sources modulated by scattering and absorption; and (3) Turtlebeach, a similar radiative transfer code that calculates molecular spectral line emission. The team will use these coupled codes to create a library of hydrodynamic simulations of isolated, evolving, and merging galaxies. They will then fold the resulting models through estimates of cosmological merger rates and merging histories obtained through semi-analytic and numerical methods. This strategy will make it possible to connect physical mechanisms operating on scales of tens of parsecs to observations from large-scale galaxy surveys. The goals of the project are (1) to construct a physically motivated unified model for the diverse ""zoo"" of high redshift galaxies, including galaxy populations expected to be discovered in deep surveys by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Herschel Space Telescope; (2) to assess the cosmological significance of the various high redshift galaxy populations, and determine the dominant contributors to cosmic stellar mass assembly and the far infrared background; and (3) to develop tools for observers based on a physical understanding of high-redshift galaxies and a critical assessment of the applicability of locally-calibrated diagnostics. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, who will be mentored and trained by the Principal Investigator.

They will develop and refine their calculations to predict when a galaxy should form stars, or develop an active nucleus. Then, the photons emerging from the galaxy will be tracked using Dr. Li's 3-dimensional radiative-transfer code. That code will be improved to handle Lyman-alpha photons, ionization, and the effect of very small dust grains. The group will produce large mock catalogs of high-redshift galaxies and quasars that describe their emission from X-ray to millimeter wavelengths, and include the hydrogen lines at 21cm and Lyman alpha. <br/><br/>Two graduate students will be trained by participating in the research. The new radiative-transfer code, and the mock catalogs, will be made available to the astronomical community. Those catalogs summarize the predictions of our theories about how galaxies grow.

From the moment the first star ended its life in a catastrophic supernova explosion, elements heavier than hydrogen and helium have been ""polluting"" the once pristine gas left over from the Big Bang. Understanding the nature of this evolution from a simple universe containing only hydrogen and helium to the one we know today, rich with the elements that have become the building blocks of life, is of great interest to the astrophysics community. However, accurately modeling and understanding this process has proven difficult. The research program to be carried out by Dr. Silvia is aimed at solving one particular mystery: why does some of the matter in the Universe appear to go missing as a function of cosmic time? While observational astronomers have endeavored to locate this matter using the powerful Hubble Space Telescope (HST), much of it continues to elude detection. Dr. Silvia will employ state-of-art cosmological simulations capable of accurately tracking the matter contained in the Universe and calculating its physical properties. By using the results of these simulations to produce synthetic observations that mimic those captured by the HST, Dr. Silvia will be able to answer the question: where is the missing matter is hiding? Alongside this research program, Dr. Silvia is driven to address the apparent lack of diversity within STEM disciplines by developing and teaching a new astronomy course that will leverage innovative educational practices shown to increase learners' identification as members of the STEM community. The course will also serve to provide learners with an enduring understanding of scientific topics and the ability to think critically about observed phenomena.<br/><br/>A significant obstacle in understanding the chemical evolution of the intergalactic medium is turning observations of quasar absorption lines into reliable estimates of metal content. In an effort to address this obstacle, the primary objectives of this work will be to characterize the mass content and ionization properties of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media and use the results to interpret current observations and inform future ones. The PI will meet these objectives by carrying out a suite of state-of-the art cosmological simulations that employ a newly-developed chemical network solver, enabling non-equilibrium calculations of the ionization structure of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media. Using completed simulations, the PI will leverage a novel technique for generating synthetic quasar absorption line spectra and compare the results to observations from the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.

0.119625,"This project will measure the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) at several wavelengths and angular scales using radio telescopes placed at South Pole Station, Antarctica. The wavelengths measured will be 3 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm, wavelengths that are absorbed by water vapor in the atmosphere, and because South Pole is one of the driest inhabited places on Earth, it is an excellent observing site. The CMBR is radiation that was produced very early in the formation of the universe, and its distribution provides the best information that can be obtained at the present time about how the universe was created. To date, all CMBR observations have shown the radiation to be isotropic, that is, the waves arrive at Earth with equal intensity from all directions. It is certain that at some level the radiation is anisotropic, and the level and angular scale at which the radiation loses its isotropy is very important for differentiating between various cosmological theories. This investigator has already made measurements from South Pole that are the most sensitive ever made anywhere, and the results are very close to ruling out one of the standard cosmologies, the so-called ""cold dark matter"" model."
1.09,"The purpose of this project is to develop highly sensitive torsion-balance instruments to search for the ultra-weak forces predicted by several modern theoretical attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of physics. This unification is faced with two deep problems: the extreme weakness of gravity compared to the other known forces, and the enormous observed disparity between the cosmological constant and the quantum-mechanical predictions of the vacuum-energy density. Theoretical ideas for overcoming these problems often predict new gravitational phenomena that can be tested with improved instruments. <br/><br/>In particular, Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation will be tested down to length scales substantially smaller than the diameter of a human hair to probe for large extra dimensions and to test a possible explanation for the observed smallness of the cosmological constant. The sensitivity of tests of Einstein's Equivalence Principle for a variety of materials will be increased by a factor of 30 to test speculations about the source of the mysterious dark energy that appears to comprise two thirds of the total mass-energy of the Universe. A special torsion pendulum that contains almost a mole of polarized electrons will be used to search, with great sensitivity, for vector fields frozen into the universe that could cause macroscopic violation of charge-parity-time reversal (CPT) symmetry.

0.261437,"Dr. Weinberg and his team develop and apply modeling methods to interpret measurements of radial velocities and multi-element chemical abundances from large spectroscopic surveys of tens or hundreds of thousands of stars. Such studies are necessary to improve our understanding of the physical processes in galaxy formation and galactic chemical evolution. The primary focus for near-term applications is to use data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey, which is a follow-up survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III). This survey will measure precise radial velocities and multi-element chemistry (about 15 elements per star) for about 100,000 red giant stars in all regions of the Milky Way. Other target data sets include the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration survey (SEGUE, another follow up survey to SDSS), and the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey of the solar neighborhood, but also data from other large surveys planned in the future .The research employs three complementary modeling approaches: Analytic chemical evolution models that incorporate radial mixing and dynamical processes, N-body/hydrodynamic simulations that model growth of a galaxy disk either in isolation or in the presence of accreting satellite galaxies, and simulations of galactic disk formation from fully cosmological initial conditions. The growing disk simulations use the Gasoline code, which is also used in the cosmological runs, but gas is added to the disk as a prescribed function of radius and time. This approach provides controlled simulations that can isolate the effects of specific physical processes, and realize distinct scenarios that can be used to distinguish processes such as galactic bulge formation by secular evolution versus formation through minor mergers. The investigators will develop and apply the technique of Principal Component Abundance Analysis (PCAA) to characterize any correlated variations of elemental abundances in large stellar data sets. The PCAA tool will be a valuable tool for understanding systematic effects and statistical errors in the APOGEE chemical abundance data and for characterizing its multi-dimensional measurements in compact form. This and other tools are likely to increase the impact of the SDSS-III data sets. For example, by applying these tools to the interpretation of APOGEE and other data sets, the investigators can address questions about the origin of the Galactic thick disk, bulge, and stellar halo, and the history of chemical enrichment and migration of stars within the thin disk. The PCAA and data-model comparisons are used to analyze the distribution of stellar chemical compositions as a function of metallicity and spatial location, and to characterize the level of chemo-dynamical substructure in different components of the Galaxy. This can constrain the importance of satellite perturbations and mergers, and by identifying the principal patterns of enrichment and rare outliers from these patterns, one can gain insights insight into the key pathways of stellar nucleosynthesis.

Recent observations have shown that the structures that we see at that time originated even before the hot big bang phase in the history of our Universe, a tiny fraction of a second after the Bang. These structures are the earliest fossils we have from our Universe's history. A wide array of new observations are underway to better characterize these structures to try to learn more about the earliest history of our Universe. This proposal will explore theoretical models for the period during which the structures originates as well as for the later history of our Universe. Both studies are needed to interpret these upcoming observations. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.

We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estiimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications. In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of this project should have a substantial application to many other equations of this general type which play important roles in other parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>Einstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open questions in this area."

Three central questions that are to be addressed concern the progenitor systems of each type of supernova, the consistency between stellar evolution hydrodynamical models for supernovae and observations of them, the values of the cosmological parameters when they are calculated using the detailed spectral models of the Spectral-fitting Expanding Atmosphere Method applied to high redshift Type II supernovae, and finally, the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with these values.<br/>***"

The methods and techniques will be combined into the remote-access SNe Ia computational pipeline, which comprises sophisticated 3D simulation algorithms for fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, as well as tools for the 3D analysis of SNe Ia data. SNe Ia are crucial for identifying the nature of dark energy, one of the most important problems facing modern science, because they serve as one of the most direct and precise distance indicators in the Universe. The results of this study will improve the cosmological calibration of these critical tools, by trying to understand what affects their status as standard candles, notably the different types of progenitor systems, deviations from spherical symmetry, and interaction with circumstellar matter. One important outcome will be a comprehensive set of observationally verified first-principles multidimensional explosion models of SNe Ia. Identifying physical correlations among predicted and observed signatures of SNe Ia will be crucial for improving the accuracy of their calibration.<br/><br/>This work is an exceptional platform for introducing students to cross-disciplinary and multi-field science, through the many areas involved in studying SNe Ia, such as numerical methods, large-scale hydrodynamics and radiation transport simulations, observations, and cosmological applications. Research results will be made available to the broad scientific community via the developed computational pipeline, and will be disseminated to the wider non-technical audience.

The study of large scale structure of the Universe is one of the most dynamically evolving areas of astrophysics today. Various cosmologies provide estimates of the fluctuation spectrum (deviation from smoothness). This work by the PI helps to distinguish and constrain various cosmologies. In particular, the PI is measuring the fluctuation spectrum of the galaxy distribution on very large (> 100Mpc) scales, overlapping with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. This work will clarify the nature of the power spectrum on very large scales, lock the small and large scale normalization of the power spectrum together. The analysis techniques may result in major new developments in understanding the nature of the fluctuations on scales over 100 Mpc. The least know, and at the same time the most interesting part of the fluctuation spectrum is on scales between 100 - 300 Mpc, close to the horizon scale at equality and recombination, where we have the most reasons to believe that something may have left a detectable imprint, like the Doppler peaks in the CMB fluctuations. ***"

These equations restrict the choice of initial data one can make for an evolving gravitational system. We are interested in parametrizing the set of solutions of the constraints (i.e., finding the degrees of freedom), developing algorithms for constructing solutions, and studying the behavior of solutions of the constraints. We hope to apply the technique of ?gluing? to implement the Einstein constraints. The idea of gluing is that, given a pair of solutions of the constraints, one attempts to connect the two solutions smoothly via a bridge joining a point in each of them. We have applied the gluing technique to the Einstein constraints, and have used it to construct multi-black hole initial data sets, to add wormholes to given solutions, to construct initial data for black holes in cosmological solutions, and to show that any given closed manifold (minus a point) admits an asymptotically flat solution of the constraints. Our work in gluing so far has assumed that the given solutions have a region of constant mean curvature, and are vacuum solutions.

Isenberg, University of Oregon <br/>PI: David Maxell, University of Alaska<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the extent to which one can parametrize and construct initial data sets for the Einstein evolution equations. We plan to capitalize on the recent progress using the conformal method to obtain new existence results in the nonconstant mean curvature (non-CMC) setting, to understand the limits of these methods, and then to develop alternate techniques toward these same goals, including degree theory, a priori estimates, and gluing methods. The Lichnerowicz equation, central to the conformal method, is a semilinear elliptic equation. Due to the mixed sign of its nonlinear exponents, it is of a type not yet fully understood. The full Lichnerowicz-Choquet-Bruhat-York set of equations is a more difficult coupled system which incorporates features presenting new analytic subtleties. The ultimate aim is to provide a complete parametrization of initial data sets, particularly in the non-CMC setting, not only on compact backgrounds but also for manifolds with asymptotically Euclidean, hyperbolic or cylindrical ends, all of which are highly relevant for physical applications. In exploring new methods, we plan to use new and advanced analytical tools, as well as increasingly accurate and flexible numerical simulation techniques. Technical advances made in the course of this project should have a substantial application to many other equations of this general type which play important roles in other parts of pure and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>Einstein's gravitational field theory is a remarkably accurate mathematical model of gravitational physics, which does an excellent job of predicting and modeling gravitational phenomena at both the astrophysical and cosmological scales. It is consistent with every known gravitational observation and experiment. From the point of view of underlying mathematics, Einstein's theory involves two very distinct types of equations. The study of dynamics of gravitational fields involves the analysis of the Einstein equations as a nonlinear system of time-dependent evolution partial differential equations (PDE), while the study of initial data sets representing gravitational states involves Riemannian geometry and the study of the Einstein constraint equations as a nonlinear system of time-independent PDE.The last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in under- standing both equations. This project focuses on developing a more complete understanding of the constraint equations. The study of the Einstein equations presents a very important point of contact between mathematics and physics, one which has motivated many advances in differential geometry and PDE on the one side, and which also has provided a compelling and accurate model of the physical world, both on the astrophysical and on the cosmological scales. This project has the potential for settling significant open questions in this area."

0.064,"Gravitational instability theories usually assume that the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations follows a power law with amplitudes drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and the existence of some form of dark matter. Alternative theories depend upon topological defects, such as monopoles, cosmic strings, textures, or other dynamical effects to generate present day structures. Various theories predict different angular spectra for CMB fluctuations. Topological defect models generally predict non-Gaussian statistics for the fluctuation amplitude distribution. We will develop methodology and software to find confidence intervals for moments of the CMB temperature distribution, multipole coefficients, and spectral parameters of ``power laws'' predicted by some theories. These estimates also test the gaussianity of the initial fluctuations. Our new methodology will include minimax estimation and ``strict bounds,'' and will rely heavily on large-scale nonlinear optimization. We will employ a network of 35 Sun SPARCStations to perform distributed simulations and solve large optimization problems in parallel. Both the minimax and strict bounds approaches require a priori constraints on the CMB, which we will derive from physical theory and by incorporating the results from other experiments on different spatial scales. The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) team recently announced the detection of fluctuations in the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). CMB fluctuations trace the primordial variations in the density of matter and energy as they were about 300,000 years after the Big Bang. These density variations are required by cosmological theories to account for observed present-day large-scale structure, e.g., galaxies, clusters of galaxies, superclusters and voids. Different theories require different structure in the primordial density, and a principal goal is to use COBE data to discriminate among these theories. The statistical tools currently used in the astrophysics comm unity do not permit rigorous discrimination among these theories: the tools are subject to known biases whose magnitudes are largely unknown. We will develop and apply new tools that use constraints derived from the cosmological theories and from other experiments to limit the possible bias and reduce the uncertainty."

0.422277,"AST-0307502<br/>Begelman, Mitchell C.<br/><br/>Not all of the matter which comes under a black hole's influence ends up inside, because accretion of just a small amount releases enough energy to expel a much larger amount. These outflows carry a lot of energy and profoundly affect the black hole's environment, as demonstrated by recent X-ray and radio observations showing that cooling flows - gas thought to be cooling and slumping into the centers of clusters - can be stopped completely by the outpouring energy.<br/><br/>This project will study the details of this influence, exerted not by outbursts but through a milder process called ""effervescent heating"", on the X-ray-emitting atmospheres of galaxy clusters, and on the growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift. The investigators will study the physical basis of effervescent heating and its implications through analytic modeling and state-of-the-art numerical simulations. They will research whether the tight coupling between galaxies and the formation of their central black holes arises from feedback via the released energy, and achieve new understanding of how the formation and evolution of super-massive black holes is linked to the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.<br/><br/>The research will promote undergraduate science education and help with the general public's understanding of scientific research, because black holes have a widespread fascination which makes them an excellent ""hook"". The PI will also maintain his contacts with science journalists and popular magazines, continue with his own writings, and use his research results in his generally available courses."

0.209571,"The Principal Investigator and his collaborators will carry out a combined program aimed at modeling the first generation of baryonic objects. The first step is adaptive-mesh refinement simulations, a popular method that adjusts the simulation box sizes to reflect the density of matter. The work self-consistently includes essential physical effects, such as the ultra-violet background radiation field and the production of metals and energy via supernovae. The results will enable us to gain a physical understanding of how these processes will affect the next generation, and to calibrate simple analytic prescriptions. In the second step, they will combine this quantitative and qualitative understanding with semi-analytic models of structure formation and reionization in order to make a wide range of observational predictions for the next generation of ground and space-based observatories.<br/><br/>A graduate student will carry out the proposed work in the form of PhD thesis research. The simulations will serve as the basis for high-quality visualizations in conjunction with personnel at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the American Museum of Natural History with whom both members of the team have worked previously. Another initiative will involve New York high school teachers and students with the Science Research Training Program."
0.114,"This project concerns quantum gravity---the unification of quantum theory and general relativity. The Principal Investigator's approach to this problem is based on the causal set hypothesis, which asserts that the deep structure of spacetime is granular or ``atomic'' with the atoms (``causal set elements'') organized into an extended ``family tree'', known technically as a locally finite partial order. The project will develop this approach further by advancing the underlying theory, while at the same time applying it to questions like that of the cosmological constant, which recently has been shown to contribute roughly two thirds of the effective energy density of the universe. A primary focus of the project will be on the development of a generalization of the classical sequential growth dynamics, found previously, to the case of a quantum causal set.<br/><br/>A solution of this problem is generally expected to tell us about the structure of spacetime on the smallest length scales and, at the same time, to help answer questions about why the cosmos is as it is on the largest scales. The project also leads to a new way of understanding time as the continual birth of new elements of the causal set. The algorithms to be developed and the codes to implement them are not only useful in connection with discrete spacetime processes but also have a more general applicability for combinatorial purposes including uses in information technology. Knowledge obtained in fundamental physics such as that studied in this project also appeals to members of the public at large and contributes towards an educated and technically skilled labor force."
0.06,"The General Theory of Relativity discovered by Einstein tells us that the familiar, everyday force of gravity is a manifestation of something much stranger: the bending of the geometry of space-time by matter. Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. This award supports research that helps aLIGO to achieve design sensitivity in the coming years by contributing to a more complete accounting of sources of noise and characterization of the detectors. This will eventually lead to the publishing of GW data to the public with robust data quality flags. Supporting scientific discoveries by empowering the community at large is a primary goal of this project. Additionally, the researchers will continue to engage the faculty of the WSU campuses in Pullman and Tri-Cities to teach undergraduate students about GW science both through lectures and lab exercises. The latter campus caters to a large percentage of Hispanic and Native-American populations, both of which are under-represented, and offers a rare setting for integrating university education with cutting-edge research in gravitation being carried out at a nearby lab.<br/><br/>The aLIGO detectors are being commissioned as we speak. These broadband detectors will also target the detection of GWs from multiple sources, such as binary black holes, spinning non-axisymmetric neutron stars, core collapse supernovae, and stochastic GW background of astrophysical or cosmological origins. They will accomplish this by resolving changes in the 4-km separations of its interferometric test mass optics that are a billionth the size of an atom. The WSU team will integrate the multiple new sensors that have been installed in aLIGO into the model of the interferometer noise budget and work on reducing any gap between its prediction and the observed noise floor."
0.12,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Adrienne Erickcek at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. <br/><br/>The evolution of the Universe during its first second is unknown. While there is strong evidence that the Universe's first second included a period of accelerated expansion called inflation, we do know why inflation happened or why it ended. We also do not know how the Universe transitioned to a hot, radiation-dominated state after inflation. Furthermore, our ignorance of the dynamics of the early Universe severely limits our understanding of the origins of dark matter, which is a poorly understood source of mass that currently makes up about 25% of the Universe's energy density. Many proposed explanations for dark matter postulate that dark matter originated from the hot plasma that filled the Universe during its first second. Consequently, the evolution of the Universe during that time affects the relationship between the properties of the dark matter particle and amount of dark matter in the Universe. This project will enhance our understanding of inflation, the onset of radiation domination, and the origins of dark matter by using gamma-ray observations to constrain the abundance of the smallest gravitationally bound structures of dark matter. <br/><br/>The PI will engage undergraduate students, high school students, and the general public in the proposed investigation of dark matter microhalos. Undergraduate students will analyze simulations of microhalo formation, thereby learning data analysis techniques and scientific programming. They will also gain first-hand research experience, which will expose them to the excitement of STEM careers. A module on dark matter will be developed for high school students to give them the opportunity to analyze publically available kinematic data for dwarf spheroidal and spiral galaxies. The PI will then lead four professional development workshops at teacher conferences to train high school teachers to use this module in their physics courses. Finally, the PI will present her research at Morehead?s monthly Carolina Science Cafe, which provides the general public the opportunity to interact with a scientific researcher in an informal setting.<br/><br/>These small dark matter structures, called microhalos, grow from density perturbations that were generated during inflation on scales that are inaccessible by other cosmological observations. They also began to evolve during the Universe's first second, prior to the onset of nucleosynthesis. This project will extend the PI's earlier analyses of microhalos' capacity to probe the evolution of the early Universe to a wider range of dark matter particles and will use N-body simulations of small volumes at high redshifts to test these analytical predictions for the microhalo abundance. These simulations will also determine how the properties of the small-scale density perturbations affect the microhalos' internal structures. The PI will then calculate the expected gamma-ray emission from dark matter annihilation within these microhalos. The resulting constraints on the small-scale primordial density fluctuations and the onset of radiation domination will determine which inflationary models are compatible with thermal-relic dark matter and may break the degeneracy between the relic density of dark matter and the evolution of the early Universe."
0.027508,"This EAGER project under the direction of PI Gary Holton takes advantage of a unique opportunity to assess the feasibility of documenting indigenous astronomy in Alaska and Canada. Although astronomy is a fundamental component of all Alaska Native cultures, there has so far been no systematic effort to document indigenous knowledge of the Alaskan sky. Rapid change in traditional land use has led to this astronomical knowledge being even more endangered than the indigenous languages themselves. In this pilot project we focus on Gwich?in, the most viable of Alaska?s Dene (Athabaskan) languages. Extrapolating on more than a year of archival research, the project will work with culture bearers in the Alaska Gwich?in region to document Gwich?in terminology for starts, constellations, and astronomical events. The project will coordinate closely with work in progress with Canadian Gwich?in being conducted under the auspices of the Gwich?in Social and Cultural Institute. Finally, the project will seek to corroborate the existence of several major cosmological themes, which permeate Northern Dene languages. The primary project deliverable will be a report describing Gwich?in knowledge of the sky, along with star charts localized to the Gwich?in region. These materials will be made available through the Alaska Native Language Archive to be used by both scholars and educators. In addition to linguist Holton, project participants include Leslie McCarthy, Curator of Oral History at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Chris Cannon, graduate student and astronomy educator."
0.223022,"This award supports an experimental search for spin-dependent forces below 1 millimeter. Present experimental limits allow for undiscovered forces in nature several million times stronger than gravity acting over distances resolvable by the unaided eye. Theoretical models developed over the past few decades that attempt to explain why interactions involving the strong nuclear force always conserve certain spacetime symmetries make specific predictions of spin-dependent forces in the sub-millimeter range. The proposed experiment thus represents an excellent opportunity for discoveries in this range. The experiment uses 1-kilohertz planar oscillators as test masses with a thin shield between them to suppress backgrounds, a technique that has demonstrated the capability to probe micron-scale distances using relatively large (square-centimeter) masses, and to operate at the limit of instrumental thermal noise at room temperature. Spin-polarized materials with high spin density but low intrinsic magnetism, including ferrimagnets that exhibit orbital compensation of the magnetism associated with the aligned electron spins, will be investigated as test masses. With modest aligned-spin densities but good control of magnetic backgrounds, the projected sensitivity of the experiment is several orders of magnitude greater than the current best limits at ranges below 1 millimeter.<br/><br/>Spin is a fundamental property of elementary particles and a crucial aspect of quantum physics. The discovery of a macroscopic force that depends on spin would have enormous implications for physics from subatomic to cosmological scales. A variety of extensions to the Standard Model (the most successful theory particle physics to date, but widely believed to be incomplete) predict short-range spin-dependent forces. These forces are mediated by particles that could contribute to the ""dark matter"" hypothesized to pervade all of space in order to explain the apparent mass distributions of galaxies. The mysterious ""dark energy"" postulated to explain the observed expansion of the universe also seems to point to a length scale on the order of tens of microns as a special range at which previously undetected phenomena might appear. During its execution, this fundamental project will also provide all participants (including several undergraduates who have contributed to this proposal) with experience in mechanical design, vacuum technology, low-noise electronics, semiconductor and magnetic materials processing, and other practical techniques useful in a wide range of science and engineering fields. The experiment will also be a key focus of the Indiana University Center for Spacetime Symmetries (IUCSS), which was founded by the PI and his colleagues to strengthen and publicize IU's growing expertise in the investigation of the structure of spacetime. Success of the proposed experiment will support the IUCSS goal to establish a long-term program of coordinated experimental and theoretical investigation of new physics at sub-millimeter length scales."

Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCS), the theory describing the forces acting within atomic nuclei, predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP). According to our cosmological models, this transition took place in the early universe at about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang. The scientific scope of this field has broadened significantly with new measurements and theoretical developments. The discussions in this workshop will include an interdisciplinary combination of concepts from elementary-particle physics, nuclear physics, QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and non-equilibrium transport theory. Attendance at the workshop will enhance the scientific communication among the junior members, particularly graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, both from experiment and theory."
0.449406,"The Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) is a unique study of the distant universe with intensive focus on the peak era of galaxy growth that occurred 10-12 billion years ago, over the cosmological redshift range from 2 to 3. KBSS measures the masess, star formation rates, stellar populations, chemistry, and gas flows in forming galaxies and the intergalactic gas surrounding them. The interface between the two, the circumgalactic medium (CGM), is the region where feedback processes will produce measureable response due to injected energy, momentum, gas, and metals. The Principal Investigator and collaborators have previously obtained extensive optical spectroscopic data on approximately 2300 galaxies in the survey fields, each of which is centered on a hyperluminous quasar. They now propose to observe these same fields with the new, NSF-funded, Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE), which their team designed and built for the Keck I telescope. With the new data, the team plans to obtain vastly improved measurements of redshift and gas kinematics for a wider range of galaxy types than previously probed, measurements of star formation rates and dust attenuation (extinction), and elemental abundances and physical conditions in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. The PI, as Project Scientist for MOSFIRE, and graduate students supported by this project will work to assist the broader astronomical community in using the instrument. The graduate students will also lead an astronomy outreach program, working with the Pasadena Unified School District to bring their enthusiasm and knowledge into 5th-8th grade classrooms."
0.653929,"The PI will reconstruct the origin of the Milky Way's stellar halo by studying the chemical compositions of its constituents: extremely metal-poor stars in the halo itself and metal-poor stars in the least luminous dwarf galaxies orbiting about the Galaxy. She will leverage her access to the Australian SkyMapper Telescope to identify large numbers of stars in the Galactic halo, and combine these data with high spectral resolution observations using the Magellan telescope. She will therefore assemble a legacy data set of the most metal-poor stars in the galaxy, which will substantially advance our understanding of the early universe and the build-up of the old stellar halo of the Milky Way. In concert, the PI will produce accompanying theoretical frameworks that allow for a cosmologically informed interpretation of stellar abundance measurements. The program has three specific goals: (1) to perform stellar archaeology, giving us new constraints on the major physical processes that drove early star formation; (2) to perform dwarf-galaxy archaeology, allowing us to better understand galaxy formation; and (3) to determine the role of metal-poor stars as tracers of the accretion history of the Milky Way halo.<br/><br/>The PI will disseminate her research to a broad audience by publicly releasing her new measurements on the chemical abundances of stars. She will also collaborate closely with the MIT Online Science, Technology, and Engineering Community (MOSTEC), which is a free online education and enrichment program for high school seniors from underserved and underrepresented communities. Finally, the PI will also create a series of short videos designed to show students how to observe with the Magellan telescopes, thereby encouraging them to be informed participants in how astronomical data are gathered."
0.070251,"The major objectives of this proposal are concerned with the study of nonlinear parabolic equations related to degenerate and singular diffusion, in connection with more complex problems of differential geometry, including the Gauss curvature flow and the Ricci flow<br/>and with physical applications such as diffusion in porous media and thin liquid film dynamics.<br/>One specific area which will be investigated concerns with the regularity and geometry of interfaces in degenerate diffusion: this long term project which was initiated in 1997, has the objective of determining the connection between the geometry and regularity of the interfaces in degenerate diffusion. Another specific area of the main objectives concerns the study fast and super-diffusive nonlinear parabolic problems: this project has the objective of studying several new important phenomena related to the well-posedness and vanishing profile of solutions to singular diffusion equations arising in physical applications and differential geometry. In particular,<br/>it involves the study of the vanishing profile of the maximal solutions to the Ricci flow and the geometric implications of these results.<br/><br/><br/>The non-linear equations to be studied under this proposal form the basic concepts of many applications which deem to be important to technology and the society at large. The purification of materials, from chemicals to petroleum and even water, is often achieved by diffusion through filters. The purification filters are the porous media described in the proposal. Thin film dynamics and the Van der Waals forces operating between thin layers are described by singular quasilinear equations of super-fast diffusion. The dynamics of population growth, polymer chain growth, including cross linking and high rate growth of biomolecules, are also non-linear phenomena amiable to our basic studies. The interesting problem of the expanding universe and other cosmological phenomena seem to be governed by nonlinear dynamics, which in certain cases are applications of the more complex problems described here."
0.450233,"The PI and co-PI of this project will combine observational and theoretical efforts to understand how ordinary (baryonic) matter flows into and out of galaxies in different environments. The observational side of the project will focus on galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with known star-forming properties that have quasars behind them. By obtaining spectra of the quasars and analyzing absorption lines due to once-ionized magnesium (Mg II) and neutral sodium (Na I) in the galaxies, they will determine the spatial extent of inflow or outflow signatures and whether they are correlated with star formation rate or environment. They will also analyze the Na I D line in lower luminosity galaxies, using spectra from the SDSS and DEEP2 surveys. The theoretical side of the project will use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to calculate model profiles of the Mg and Na lines, in order to interpret the observations and identify signatures of ""cold flow"" accretion. The results from this study will inform the science justifications for, and implicitly the design of, next-generation ground-based telescopes. Also, the PI and co-PI, as instructors in the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, will develop a laboratory project using elements of their research for high-school students."
0.288186,"A great mystery of the Universe is how the first stars and galaxies formed. Astrophysicists can virtually look back in time by examining some of the most distant galaxies in the Universe, whose light has taken billions of years to reach Earth. Detailed, careful study of these very distant galaxies is critical to understanding how the first stars and galaxies formed. Unfortunately, it is very challenging to identify these galaxies. This project aims to use a new technique that exploits gravitational lensing by foreground clusters of galaxies that magnify these distant galaxies, making them easier to detect.<br/><br/>The principal investigators' (PIs') new theoretical framework for analyzing multiple-lensing planes reveals that there are mass distributions consisting of multiple structures along the line-of-sight and large integrated masses that produce a many-fold increase in the number of lensed z > ~7 sources, particularly at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. These beams are effective because they create significant magnification over a large area, or high etendue. Cosmological simulations suggest that they are rare but identifiable by choosing lines-of-sight with the highest integrated luminosities of galaxies that trace the densest structures, i.e., luminous red galaxies. The PIs have now identified 40 such lines-of-sight in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Spectroscopy of the first seven confirms that they are likely the most powerful gravitational lens telescopes in the sky. This project will use a comprehensive observational and theoretical program to enable highly efficient ground- and space-based follow-up surveys for lensed z ~ 7 to 10 sources. Using galaxy spectroscopy and lensed arc imaging to constrain each line-of-sight mass distribution, coupled with theoretical modeling to generate a precise lensing magnification map, the PIs will place the first limits on the faint end luminosity evolution of the most distant galaxies.<br/><br/>This work will advance the training of graduate students at The University of Arizona and Rutgers University by allowing them to work with senior personnel on forefront observational analyses and theoretical modeling. Co-PI Zabludoff is involved in The University of Arizona's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) chapter, where she discusses her research in their workshops for teenage girls. She will also talk about astronomy research and careers with members of the Tohono O'odham Nation and with students in local schools. Co-PI Keeton is the Faculty Director of the Aresty Research Center for Undergraduates at Rutgers, a privately-endowed center that supports approximately 200 student research projects each year. This project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education via the co-PI's partnership, advance the teaching of faculty and the training and learning of students, broaden the dissemination of knowledge through the public release of the lens modeling software, and may increase the participation of underrepresented women and Native Americans through outreach."
0.332036,"All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the Universe, but a dark matter particle has yet to be directly detected. A well-motivated possible candidate is a light axion. Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may be detected through their conversion into a narrow microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. Using this concept the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has performed a search for such axions within the mass range of a few micro-eV. Recently a smaller microwave cavity experiment was constructed called ADMX-HF (High Frequency), specifically to explore higher ranges of axion masses. ADMX-HF also serves as a test-bed for innovations in microwave cavity and amplifier technologies that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform. ADMX-HF and ADMX operate as ""one experiment, two sites"", sharing expertise, technology, and data. This award will expand the collaboration to accelerate the construction of ADMX-HF as well as dramatically expand its initial capability.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: ADMX has proven to be a technology driver as components such as the SQUID amplifiers developed for ADMX are already being used for other purposes. Innovations to be developed by ADMX-HF have similarly broad potential. Both PI and Co-PI are committed educators with long experience in involving undergraduate students in their research and engaging the public. The research funded through this award will inform additional education and outreach initiatives with which they are involved."
0.815828,"The Milky Way Laboratory will create interactive access to one of the largest numerical simulations of cosmological structure ever created. With its data volume close to a petabyte, it illustrates the emerging data challenge -- how new breakthroughs require non-incremental changes in the way we do science. As datasets are doubling in size every year, traditional analysis techniques are no longer adequate. Scientists need a new instrument, like a ""microscope of data"", a data-scope, that can look at both the details and the large-scale features in the mountains of digital data. Increased raw computer power is necessary, but not enough -- we also need to use new computational thinking to develop the new approaches needed. The NSF-supported research aims to achieve such a breakthrough in data-intensive computational analysis. <br/><br/>The particular science focuses on the compelling question of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy, the home of the Sun and our solar system. Understanding our place in the Universe will in turn lead to insight into the nature of the enigmatic 'dark matter', the substance whose gravity holds the Milky Way together, but about which little is known. The project will create a publicly accessible 'Milky Way Laboratory' that will combine the output of the largest state-of-the-art computer simulations of the formation of the Milky Way with the largest observational datasets of the properties of stars (like the Sun) in our Galaxy, and provide the means to answer questions that go beyond the scope of either dataset. <br/><br/>The publicly accessible data and the tools developed will enable scientists to run their own innovative experiments at unprecedented scales, demonstrating that it is possible to tackle problems on the petabyte scale in a university setting today. The project will provide a blueprint to address similar data-intensive problems in other areas of science.<br/><br/>The international team consists of astronomers, particle physicists and computer scientists from academia (Johns Hopkins and UC Santa Cruz) and industry to accomplish its ambitious goals.

0.163586,"As the most commonly observed objects, stars remain at the forefront of astrophysical research. Technical advances in detectors, computer processing power, networks and data storage have enabled new sky surveys. Many of these search for transient events at optical wavelengths, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS1 that probe ever-larger areas of the sky and ever-fainter sources, opening up the vast discovery space of ""time domain astronomy"". The recent Kepler and COROT space missions achieved nearly continuous monitoring of more than 100,000 stars. The stellar discoveries from these surveys include revelations about stellar evolution, rare stars, unusual explosion outcomes, and remarkably complex binary star systems. The immediate future holds tremendous promise, as both the space-based survey Gaia and the ground based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come to fruition. This tsunami of data has created a new demand for a reliable and publicly available research and education tool in computational stellar astrophysics that will reap the full scientific benefits of these discoveries while also creating a collaborative environment where theory, computation and interpretation can come together to address critical scientific issues. This demand by the stellar community led to our release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project in 2011. MESA has driven, and will continue to drive with support from this award, innovation in the stellar community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, and cosmological communities. Educators have widely deployed MESA in their undergraduate and graduate stellar evolution courses because MESA is a community platform with an active support network for leading-edge scientific investigations. Stellar astrophysics research, and all the communities that rely on stellar astrophysics, will be significantly enhanced by sustaining innovative development of MESA.<br/><br/>This award supports the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project and user community. MESA solves the 1D fully coupled structure and composition equations governing stellar evolution. It is based on an implicit finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls; state-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion, boundary conditions, and changes to the mass of the star. MESA is an open source library that employs contemporary numerical approaches, supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP, and is written with present and future multi-core and multi-thread architectures in mind. MESA combines the robust, efficient, thread-safe numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars. Innovations in MESA and its domain of applicability continues to grow, just recently extended to include giant planets, oscillations, and rotation.

This award supports research in three critical areas relevant to LIGO data analysis: (i) searches for a cosmological or astrophysical GW background, (ii) a statistical search for GWs from gamma-ray bursts, and (iii) detector characterization.<br/><br/>The first project will improve our sensitivity to GW backgrounds that have a non-uniform distribution of power on the sky. The second will develop methods to optimally use the information provided by NASA missions (Swift and Fermi) in GW searches. The third will use advanced data mining methods to develop a better understanding of real data, which will benefit the sensitivity of all GW searches. Three graduate students will receive direct training in GW data analysis, thus adding to the growing community of researchers in this emerging field. Since the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is an Hispanic serving institution, the research activities will expose students who are traditionally under-represented in the areas of science and technology to forefront scientific research.

0.134325,"Einstein's field equations, besides providing the basis for the best current description of the behavior of gravitational physics on the astrophysical and cosmological scale, also is the source of a rich collection of mathematically interesting questions. Prof. Isenberg will investigate several of these, including: 1. solutions of the Einstein constraint equations of a more general character than currently known 2. occurrence of singularities in solutions to Einstein's equations (i.e. the so-called ""Strong Cosmic Censorship"" conjecture) 3. the relationship between mathematical manifolds and their geometries (i.e. ""Ricci flows"") This work will increase the interaction of ideas and tools in mathematics and theoretical physics."
1.749271,"Research in theoretical physics will involve work on a great variety of topics in elementary particle physics, statistical mechanics, and astrophysics. The studies will include analyses of the effects of the strong nuclear force using an approximation in which the continuum of space is replaced by a discrete lattice of points, research in conformal quantum field theory (which has applications to particle and condensed matter physics), analyses of weak interaction phenomena in stars, studies of inflationary cosmological models and of candidates for the non-luminous matter in the universe, and work on numerous additional topics. The discrete approximation to the strong nuclear force is the leading approach to understanding many of the effects of this force, weak interaction phenomena can play a decisive role in such processes as a supernova explosion, and the nature of the non-luminous matter is one of the major riddles of astronomy."

(AUI) will manage the operation of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2015, maintaining the strong reputation of NRAO as the premier radio astronomy observatory in the world. The research community will be provided cutting-edge<br/>capabilities: the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the most precise filled-aperture, fully steerable radio telescope; the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), replacing the Very Large Array, already the most productive radio telescope ever built; the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), with micro-arcsecond<br/>astrometry, the highest resolution imaging telescope at any wavelength; and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), with unprecedented millimeter-wavelength sensitivity and resolution. All will operate with state-of-the art instrumentation, advanced data processing, and broad user<br/>support, enabling the entire astronomy community to address key problems in astronomy and astrophysics.<br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The opportunities for astronomy and astrophysics research have never been richer. The unique NRAO radio telescopes will complement the next generation of large ground based optical telescopes and space-based facilities covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Together they<br/>comprise a comprehensive suite of powerful tools to probe and decipher the full range of outstanding problems, from the origin of planets, stars, quasars and galaxies, to the structure of the Universe and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Observations with VLBA, EVLA and ALMA will shed new light on<br/>exoplanets, and planetary and stellar formation and evolution. EVLA and ALMA will image the gas and dust of the first galaxies near the end of the epoch of reionization and normal galaxies beyond z~1. VLBA microarcsecond astrometry is making possible a new class of precision measurements of the parallax of premain sequence stars, recoil motions of stars in response to exoplanets, the structure of the Galaxy and the dynamics of the Local Group of galaxies. Accurate pulsar timing with the GBT is enabling high precision<br/>tests of General Relativity in the strong field limit and detection of the stochastic background of nanoHertz gravitational waves. Multi-epoch high resolution VLBA images will lead to a better understanding of relativistic jets from micro-quasars and supermassive black holes found in Active Galactic Nuclei, along with the nature of gamma-ray bursts seen by the GLAST satellite. GBT will discover new megamasers, and follow-up VLBA observations will provide the angular-diameter distance determination of galaxies in the Hubble flow, leading to a more accurate determination of the Hubble Constant, higher precision determination of cosmological constants, and better constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT: NRAO facilities are used by more than one thousand scientists each year and are available to all scientists based on the intellectual merits of the proposed studies, independent of institutional or national affiliation. NRAO will provide end-to-end user support at its science centers, enabling easy<br/>access to its telescope and their data by the entire astronomical community. Calibrated images will be made available in archives accessible to both the broad research community and the public through the Virtual Astronomical Observatory. Astronomy is an important element in meeting national goals related to diversity, science and technology education, and increased U.S. competitiveness. NRAO is attracting an increasingly diverse staff. Through the undergraduate Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and co-op programs, resident graduate fellowships and external student grants, Green Bank and Socorro summer schools, and competitive postdoctoral Jansky Fellowships, it continues to help train the next generation of scientists. The Green Bank Science Center, the VLA Visitors Center, US-Chile teacher/student exchange programs, and teacher and K-12 education programs, further serve to create a science-literate public."

0.519102,"Gravity, the most evident force of nature, is in fact the weakest of the fundamental forces, and consequently the most poorly tested. Einstein's general relativity, which is currently our best description of gravity, is fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics and is likely to be replaced by a more complete theory in the future. A modified theory would predict small deviations in the solar system that could have profound consequences for our understanding of the Universe as a whole. Lunar laser ranging (LLR), in which short laser pulses launched from a telescope are bounced off of reflectors placed on the moon by U.S. astronauts and Soviet landers, has for decades produced various leading tests of gravity by mapping the shape of the lunar orbit to high precision. The group proposes to continue conducting leading-edge observations with the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO), in an effort to subject gravity to the most stringent tests yet. APOLLO, situated atop a 9,200 ft summit in Southern New Mexico, introduces a new regime of millimeter-precision in measuring the lunar orbit. However, incomplete models are thus far unable to confirm the accuracy. The group will therefore seek to build a calibration system to ensure that APOLLO meets its millimeter measurement goal, in addition to continuing the observation campaign. The proposed work will benefit the broader community in a number of ways. On the intellectual front, improving our knowledge of gravity informs a diverse range of cosmologists, astrophysicists, particle physicists, and string theorists. The effort would also contribute to Earth and planetary science, especially via measurements produced by the superconducting gravimeter. The APOLLO team will continue a track record of engagement in education and outreach activities, and will no doubt continue to attract public interest through print, web, radio, and television media.<br/><br/>Among other attributes that contribute to APOLLO's superior observations, routine ranging to all five lunar reflectors on timescales of minutes dramatically improves our ability to gauge lunar orientation and body distortion. This information allows a more precise determination of the path for the Moon's center of mass, thereby facilitating tests of fundamental gravity. Simultaneously, higher precision range measurements, together with data from a superconducting gravimeter at the Apache Point Observatory and from a high-quality Global Positioning System (GPS) station 2.5 km away, will greatly improve our understanding of the instantaneous location of the Observatory with respect to the Earth's center of mass (needed for the gravitational tests) by exposing subtle Earth dynamics that must be incorporated into the model. LLR measurements provide the best available tests of the strong equivalence principle, the time-rate-of-change of Newton's gravitational constant, gravitomagnetism, the inverse-square law, and preferred frame effects. In addition to these classical gravitational tests, APOLLO will permit testing of new ideas in physics relating to dark energy, extra dimensions, and violations of Lorentz Invariance. A large part of the effort proposed here is the construction of an absolute calibration system based on a cesium clock standard, a low-jitter short-pulse laser, and a precision interval counter. This system will provide an independent check of APOLLO's fundamental measurement, potentially identifying faults and confirming their pursuant remediation."

She will use the Deep Lens Survey (DLS) underway at CTIO to continue her studies of the two-point angular correlation function between foreground galaxies and high redshift quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). The DLS will increase ten-fold the number of QSOs used in the most recent large scale, homogeneous survey completed in her earlier work. This increase in sample will enable a more accurate measure of the amplitude and scale of the correlation function which will be used to put limits on cosmological parameters. The DLS will also provide data to search for galaxy distortions or shear in these QSO fields. She will also work with the DLS team to improve the image quality of the MOSAIC II camera on the CTIO 4-meter to ensure that any shear signals, if present, can be detected. Dr. Norman will also initiate and participate in a number of outreach projects at CTIO and NOAO that will bridge educational initiatives in the US and in Chile.

Intracluster starlight can be a valuable tool in understanding the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, but it has been difficult to detect, and its detailed structure is still unknown. The campaign will consist of imaging and spectroscopic observations of hundreds of intracluster planetary nebulae in nearby galaxy clusters and groups to perform dynamical studies, ultra-deep imaging observations to produce global measurements of the intracluster light in more distant clusters, and theoretical analysis of high resolution numerical simulations of galaxy clusters, designed to obtain observable predictions. This effort will determine the fraction, distribution, and metallicity of the intracluster starlight, and connect its properties to cosmological models and known properties of galaxy evolution. <br/><br/>In addition to his research, Dr. Feldmeier will develop a career course for astronomy undergraduate majors.

They will use the Argos time-series photometer on the 2.1m at McDonald Observatory, supplemented by the 4.1m SOAR telescope in Chile, the 1.2m telescope at McDonald Observatory, and the CTAS 0.6m telescope in central Texas. New data will be analyzed to address fundamental astrophysical problems in three broad areas. First, they will model the detailed shapes of individual light curves to constrain the physics of turbulent heat transport (convection). This part of the project will employ supercomputer hydrodynamical simulations of convection. Second, they will measure the change in pulsation period due to cooling, which will place constraints on the stars' axion emission. Axions are candidates for dark matter particles, so the development and application of this technique might provide new tests of the cosmological significance of axions. Third, they will continue their observations and analysis of the recently-discovered new class of variable star, the hot DQV carbon-atmosphere white dwarfs. Currently, there are three known members of this class. Two of these stars contain a strong magnetic field, making them ideal targets for studying the interplay of pulsation, convection, and magnetic fields.<br/><br/>This group will continue to develop content for the Freshman Research Initiative program at UT-Austin, which will involve freshmen and sophomore science majors in cutting-edge science. As in recent years, high school students will participate in observing runs, and three high school teachers have joined this group to assist in observing and learn the scientific method first hand. The team is broadening this participation through a program whereby small groups of high school students spend entire nights at lock-ins at their high school; they are electronically linked to the observations being taken at McDonald Observatory through the Argos Online website and can teleconference with the astronomers in the dome. In addition, they have an active collaboration with the Central Texas Astronomical Society. As part of this project, they will develop a database of observations accessible via a web interface. This archive will allow rapid searching of the observations, and will be made freely available to the community."
0.997781,"This project centers on optical (visible-light) observations using large, ground-based telescopes, designed to maximally exploit the science return from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT, an NSF-funded experiment at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, consists of a 10-meter diameter, millimeter-wave radio telescope designed to measure the subtle fluctuations in the brightness of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at multiple wavelengths. As part of its survey operations, the SPT is producing a list of possible galaxy clusters detected by the effect the hot, intra-cluster plasma has on the CBR. The size of this spectral distortion, known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, is independent of distance, offering the opportunity to inventory galaxy clusters in the universe, relatively free of the strong distance bias that affects other types of observations. In this project the collaborating team (from Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Harvard University) will perform optical follow-up observations of the SPT cluster candidates, to confirm the existence of the clusters, to obtain their redshifts, and to identify the member galaxies. The team will make use of an array of existing instrumentation on the current suite of large telescopes, including PISCO, a multi-bandpass imaging camera developed with NSF support for the 6.5-meter Magellan telescope. The primary result of this work will be an unprecedented, volume-limited catalog of approximately 600 galaxy clusters. The full catalog of photometric and spectroscopic observations will be released to the astronomical community through a web-accessible archive using well-developed database architectures. These observations are intended to enable a wide variety of subsequent inquiries, including studies of galaxy evolution in different environments, efforts to further constrain cosmological parameters, and cluster mass measurements through gravitational lensing.

Unfortunately, many details of possible polarized foreground signals are still unknown, and this is expected to be the single most significant obstacle to accurate measurements of the CMB polarization. This trial project will use the Green Bank radio telescope to measure the high frequency polarization of a carefully selected sample of some 35 galaxies, in order to decide on the feasibility and usefulness of a much larger future survey. Such measurements are necessary because prior extensive data are only available for low frequencies, where depolarization effects in transit are significant. Whatever the conclusion about the continued survey, this pilot study will produce useful data on galaxy properties, and will introduce two promising undergraduate students to research with an experienced team."

(B) Understanding and classifying critical behavior in boundary regions in systems such as the semiclassical sine-Gordon and long-time nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and uncovering fundamental properties of associated Painleve functions. (C) Asymptotic analysis of models in two spatial and one temporal variables, such as the Davey-Stewartson II and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equations, requiring the d-bar approach to inverse scattering. These three projects will make use of and further develop recent advances in asymptotic analysis, scattering theory, and the study of orthogonal polynomials and random matrices.<br/><br/>Nonlinear wave equations are powerful mathematical models for energy transmission in fluid dynamics, solid state physics, and other physical systems. Specific applications of the models considered include the evolution of cosmological structures, the onset of wave collapse in fiber-optic cables and superconducting Josephson junctions, the accumulation of fluid vortices, and Hele-Shaw flow. Solutions to these equations are typically too complex to describe in full generality, yet salient features often become clear in certain asymptotic limits for entire families of initial conditions. This universality is an indication of the reasonableness of the equation as a good physical model. Incorporating the effect of interaction terms in multicomponent systems, analyzing critical transitions to help completely describe global behavior, and developing the mathematical tools necessary to study systems in two spatial dimensions will help build a fuller picture of the behavior of general nonlinear wave equations and their applicability as physical models."

Such data provide essential ingredients for understanding and modeling the evolution of galaxies, and for understanding the physical processes that drive this evolution. They also provide the opportunity to develop and test the diagnostic methods needed to interpret observations of more distant galaxies at cosmological lookback times. Specific projects to be carried out include the following: 1) The determination of the star formation histories of galactic disks as a function of Hubble type and radius within individual galaxies, based on Ha and broadband surface photometry of 30 spiral galaxies. 2) A study of the systematic properties of OB/HII associations in spiral galaxies, based on a combination of groundbased imaging and spectroscopy and imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope. 3) An observational study of the stellar populations and star formation properties of galactic mergers. 4) An investigation of the form of the star formation rate vs. gas density law in disks, based on CCD observations of a complete sample of nearly spirals. Gravitational threshold and self-regulating star formation models will be tested. 5) Studies of the dynamics of the ionized interstellar gas in Magellanic irregular galaxies. These are directed at measuring the dynamic interactions between massive stars and the interstellar medium, and the role of large-scale winds and flows in the evolution of dwarf galaxies."
0.015077,"Around the globe, ancient monuments represent collective (local, ethnic, religious, and national) histories and identities. Under the best circumstances, international, national, and local efforts come together to preserve historical architecture, landscapes, and artifacts. However, recent events, ranging from the destruction of antiquities in the Middle East, to UNESCO's offer to moderate conflicts over the ownership of the Parthenon Marbles, to federal legislation regulating the treatment and repatriation of ancestral Native American human remains and artifacts, demonstrate that material heritage can also be the subject of conflict. Monuments and antiquities, the source and representation of memory and history, take many forms and convey different meanings to different audiences: they may analyzed by scientists, visited by tourists, or revered as sacred places by descendant communities. There are also many ways to write the history and significance of such monuments. However, Indigenous oral histories and cultural perspectives on constructions built by their ancestor have been given little priority or attention in either analysis or interpretation. The research supported by this award addresses the question of what might be gained when descendent communities are included in interpreting ancient places and their meanings. Would it enrich their value for researchers and for the public -- and if so, how does this come about?<br/><br/>To address these questions, University of Virginia doctoral student, Lee Bloch, supervised by Dr. Jeffrey L. Hantman, will undertake field research in the eastern United States. The southern part of this region is notable for the continuing presence of very visible but also quite ancient earthen temple mounds, effigy mounds, and burial mounds constructed largely between c. 3500 BCE and 1600 CE by the ancestors of contemporary Native Americans. Although many mound sites were destroyed over the past few centuries, a large number are now protected by federal and state preservation law. The researcher will focus on the mounds in one Muskogee (Creek) tribal town in northern Florida. Using an ethnographic methodology, he will collect data on how community members maintain and interpret histories related to mound sites in five ongoing contexts: pilgrimages to mound sites, recitations of oral traditions, performances of ceremonial practices and dances, apprenticeships with ceremonial leaders and specialists, and community discussions about cosmological knowledge. The investigator hypothesizes that these expressive performances, which could be missed by outsider analysis, may in fact be key elements of what the mounds are and that paying attention to aesthetic principles of these performances may enhance understanding of mound landscapes and artifacts. Findings from this research may further scientific and cultural understanding of Native American history and cultures, as well as how all communities are both affected by and affect the materiality of their landscapes."
0.4257,"The extragalactic radio astronomy program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will emphasize the study of gravitational lenses, the development of Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and the study of the structure of extragalactic radio sources.

That material forms the basis of gravitational lens search, carried out jointly with colleagues at Princeton and California Institute of Technology. The VLA snapshots are examined and classified, and the most likely gravitational lensing. The resulting examples will then be used to study the distribution of matter in galaxies and in the universe as a whole. The temporal variations of lensed complexes will be followed, and as in the first successfully monitored example, there will be a concerted effort to determine the value of the Hubble constant, and if the value is discordant, to understand the cosmological implications of such variations. The survey will also provide raw material to allow the search for radio galaxies and quasars of very high redshift."
0.203401,"Cosmological measurements over the past ten years indicate that 23% of the matter in the<br/>Universe is dark matter. The favored candidates for dark matter are massive particles which weakly interact with neutrons and protons. Several experiments are underway to detect dark matter by measuring the total energy a dark matter particle transfers to a nucleus in an elastic collision. The proposal is to build a detector that will measure both the direction and energy of the recoiling nucleus. Since the earth moves through a static halo of dark matter, the ability to determine the apparent direction from which the dark matter arrives gives this scheme a decisive advantage over experiments which simply measure the nuclear recoil energy. <br/><br/>Two approaches are proposed. In one scheme (using CF4 gas), the image of the recoil is determined by imaging the photons emitted in the amplification process using a CCD camera. The MIT-BU group has demonstrated this method in a 0.05 liter detector and the proposal is to now construct a 250 l detector capable of making a scientifically competitive measurement. The use of CF4 also gives this scheme unique access to spin dependent interactions between dark matter and neutrons and protons. <br/><br/>In the second scheme (using CS2 gas), charges collected on the wires of the amplification system determine the direction of the recoil. This method has been demonstrated by the DRIFT collaboration, which operates detectors in the Boulby Mine, and the proposal is to make a major improvement of the electronics in the DRIFT detectors to make them scientifically competitive. The two approaches complement each other by searching for spin-dependent (CF4) and spin-independent (CS2) interactions.<br/><br/>In the area of Broader Impacts, although the proposal is for a dark matter detector, the same system could be used for detection of low energy neutrons and may be valuable for radiography, reactor safety or cargo screening. A key element is the large charge coupled device (CCD) camera and optical system."
0.327552,"AST-0206010<br/>Schechter, Paul L.<br/><br/>In this project two distinct strategies will be used to search at optical wavelengths for gravitationally lensed quasars. First, conventional (but highly automated) pointed direct images will be obtained of 6500 known quasars with the Magellan I (Baade) telescope. Second, direct images in three filters will be obtained for 1000 square degrees with 0.24 arcsecond pixels and subarcsecond resolution with the MPIA 2.2-m telescope. A conservative estimate of the expected number of lenses is 32, exceeding the number of systems found separately in the past two decades by either optical or radio techniques. As 90% of quasars are radio quiet, these two searches will complement recent successful radio searches and furnish systems bright enough for extensive followup at optical wavelengths. Gravitationally lensed quasars select galaxies by mass, rather than light. Samples of lensing galaxies, typically at intermediate redshifts, complement intermediate redshift samples selected by apparent magnitude. They give mass functions rather than luminosity functions, an important component of galaxy evolution models. Lensed quasars also permit measurement of the Hubble constant, the cosmological parameter which sets the scale for the Universe. The Hubble constant is sufficiently important that it warrants a measurement completely independent of the traditional parallax and standard candle based methods.<br/>***"

Gross and Polchinski are largely focused on the construction of a unified theory of gravity and the particle interactions, based on string theory and related ideas. Particular approaches are the study of the quantum mechanical properties of black holes, the emergence of space-time from a more fundamental theory, and the understanding of higher symmetries that appear in these theories. Sugar studies the properties of the strong nuclear interaction using large-scale computation, directed at testing the existing Standard Model of particle properties and the search for new physics. Srednicki and Zee study models of known and new particles, including neutrinos, supersymmetric particles, and dark matter. These are all areas where a host of experiments will continue to report new results, from the LHC and Fermilab to a variety of deep-mine and space-based observations. The members of the group are broad in their interests and work on other areas as well, including nonequilibrium dynamics, quantum chaos and its connections with mathematics and physics, new methods and applications in quantum field theory (the basic mathematical framework for quantum physics), and the understanding of the cosmological constant, which drives the accelerating expansion of the universe.<br/><br/>The training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows is a major activity of this grant.

Lee have studied the first conjecture of Sir Michael Atiyah on identifying these invariants of three-spheres, and also extended the invariants to slightly larger classes of three-spheres. The major part of this project is, not only to identify these invariants (the first Atiyah conjecture), but also to identify the way to relate these invariants to each other (the second Atiyah conjecture). Such an identification suggests a ""hidden duality"" between conformal field theory and four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. The other part of this project is to study intrinsic properties for the invariants of larger classes of three-spheres. It is a fundamental aim to investigate the change of the new invariants under certain topological operations. The project will lead to a study of relations between Floer theory, which is an invariant from mathematical physics, and other constructions of knot theory, as well as the generalization of the invariants to general three-manifolds. A three-dimensional manifold is a space where a nearsighted person sees a standard three-dimensional space everywhere. (Homology) three-spheres are those three-manifolds that one cannot tell from the standard three-sphere by using the usual topological tools. That such exist indicates the complexity of the world we live in, even ignoring the time dimension, thus making three-spheres of cosmological and physical interest. The topological invariants in the project are intended to distinguish manifolds by systematically studying their properties with respect to several quantum field theories. It is therefore valuable to investigate these new invariants and their structure s for three-spheres and general three-manifolds. This project addresses some of the most fundamental problems in this subject. ***"

0.105,"The singularity theorems tell us that singularities form in a large class of spacetimes, including the physically relevant cases of the big bang and of the gravitational collapse of a star to form a black hole. However, these theorems tell us very little about the nature of the singularities. For example, we would like to know for the entire class of incomplete observers, how the curvature behaves along their world lines and whether they can see the singularity before they hit it. Since we do not have the general solution of Einstein's equation in closed form, the PI intends to perform numerical studies of spacetimes with singularities to address these issues. The PI has already developed and successfully applied a fully 3-space dimensional vacuum code to study cosmological singularities and has found support for the BKL picture of oscillatory singularities. He plans to complement this with further work involving matter sources to test the idea that ""matter doesn't matter"" near the big bang. The PI also will study how coordinate conditions effect the numerical evolution of colliding black holes."
0.400139,"PROPOSAL NO: AST 0206067<br/>PI: Sargent, W L W<br/>The past few years have witnessed remarkable progress in understanding the origin and properties of the intergalactic medium, which gives rise to the absorption features known as the ''Lyman alpha forest'' in the spectra of distant quasars. Comparison of the results of high resolution spectroscopy with hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the high redshift (z ~ 3) universe have shown that the Lyman alpha forest is the observational signature of an extended ionized gas arranged in the shape of filaments and sheets, the ''Cosmic web'', from which galaxies condense. This main reservoir of baryons has properties which can be characterized by gas dynamics (temperature, pressure, ionization state) on a small scale; on larger scales the gas follows the distribution and peculiar motions of the dark matter which dominates the mass content of the universe. Observations of Lyman alpha absorption probe the ionization history and baryon density of the universe as well as the variations in the dark matter distribution which leads to the formation of structure in the universe. The funded work will continue and extend observations and analyses in a program of quasar absorption line studies and a program to detect emission from the Lyman alpha forest clouds using the HIRES and LRIS instruments on the Keck Telescopes."
0.315,"This experimental research program is aimed at performing improved tests of Lorentz and CPT symmetry of the neutron and the proton using a noble gas (129Xe/3He) Zeeman maser and a hydrogen maser, respectively. In the proposed three-year program the PI will optimize the performance of the upgraded 129Xe/3He and hydrogen masers; perform long-term monitoring (more than one year) of maser (i.e., spin precession) frequencies; characterize possible systematic effects; and analyze and present the results of these measurements. The expected result of this study is unprecedented sensitivity to possible effects of quantum gravity such as an anisotropy or non-commutativity of space-time, and to the coupling of neutrons and protons to a time-varying cosmological scalar field, which is a leading candidate for dark energy. The broader impact of the program involves student education as well as applications, including MRI at low magnetic fields of hyperpolarized noble gas inhaled into human lungs for studies of basic pulmonary physiology and diseases such as asthma and emphysema."

Drs.George C.C. Chang and Chung Yun Chang request funds for travel and communication to carry out the pilot experiment on neutrino oscillation using anti-neutrino particles generated by the Taiwan nuclear power plants. neutrino is one of the elementary particles in particle and astro-physics. Neutrino oscillation may provide the information for many fundamental questions in physics, such as whether neutrinos have finite masses or different masses for different neutrino flavor transitions. This study addresses a very important fundamental question in physics. The Taiwan National Science Council will provide $200,000 for the first year of this experiment and one million dollars per year for next four years if the initial experiment proves to be promising. It is an exploratory project with potential major scientific payoff. The majority of the laboratory and research cost will be provided by the Taiwan National Science Council and the Taiwan Power Company. If successful, experimental results may lead to answers to questions on fundamental properties of neutrinos and to cosmological puzzles such as the deficit of solar neutrinos and the properties of dark matter.

0.12,"This award supports a program of theoretical research on consequences of quantum field processes both at the late stage of the evolution of black holes and at the initial stage of the early universe. A framework called stochastic gravity is used to study these issues because it is especially well suited for treating quantum field fluctuations that have not been included in previous work on these topics. Quantitative results may be obtained from the Einstein-Langevin equation defining this framework. Techniques and concepts from quantum<br/>information theory are also used to address the black hole information issue. These methods may also be used to calculate the gravitational wave form and emitted energy from binary systems potentially detectable by LIGO and LISA. <br/><br/>Determination of the magnitude of metric fluctuations near the black hole horizon due to quantum fields is essential to finding a solution to the backreaction problem: how Hawking radiation affects the state and dynamics of a black hole, both under quasi-equilibrium (in a box) and non-equilibrium (evaporating) conditions. Stochastic gravity provides an easier to implement route towards structure formation from second order metric perturbations needed in inflationary cosmologies based on higher order curvature theories. A new formulation of gravitational wave dynamics for binary masses with radiation reaction is useful for treating the self force on the small mass and backreaction of it on the motion of the large mass self-consistently without making the slow motion or the weak field assumptions."
1.332278,"ABSTRACT<br/>AST 0228974<br/><br/>The Combined Array for Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) will merge at a new site two existing telescope arrays currently supported by the Division of Astronomical Science's University Radio Observatories (URO) Program. These are Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) array of six 10.4-meter-diameter telescopes, and the Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association (BIMA) array of nine 6.1-meter-diameter telescopes. CARMA will achieve resolutions as high as 0.2 arcseconds at a wavelength of 1mm and, due to its heterogeneous combination of telescope diameters, will provide excellent imaging on all angular scales. CARMA's sensitivity in the 1 mm band will be an order of magnitude greater than that of the existing arrays due to the lower atmospheric attenuation of the new site (an 8000' plateau in the Inyo Mountains about 15 miles from the current OVRO site), and the merged array's greater collecting area, improved receivers and spectrometer, and adaptive atmospheric phase correction. The new science enabled by CARMA covers a broad range of astronomical topics, including star formation and molecular clouds, studies of external galaxies, cosmological studies using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and the investigation of solar system objects."

With its data volume close to a petabyte, it illustrates the emerging data challenge -- how new breakthroughs require non-incremental changes in the way we do science. As datasets are doubling in size every year, traditional analysis techniques are no longer adequate. Scientists need a new instrument, like a ""microscope of data"", a data-scope, that can look at both the details and the large-scale features in the mountains of digital data. Increased raw computer power is necessary, but not enough -- we also need to use new computational thinking to develop the new approaches needed. The NSF-supported research aims to achieve such a breakthrough in data-intensive computational analysis. <br/><br/>The particular science focuses on the compelling question of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy, the home of the Sun and our solar system. Understanding our place in the Universe will in turn lead to insight into the nature of the enigmatic 'dark matter', the substance whose gravity holds the Milky Way together, but about which little is known. The project will create a publicly accessible 'Milky Way Laboratory' that will combine the output of the largest state-of-the-art computer simulations of the formation of the Milky Way with the largest observational datasets of the properties of stars (like the Sun) in our Galaxy, and provide the means to answer questions that go beyond the scope of either dataset. <br/><br/>The publicly accessible data and the tools developed will enable scientists to run their own innovative experiments at unprecedented scales, demonstrating that it is possible to tackle problems on the petabyte scale in a university setting today.

The absorption, scattering, and re-emission of light by cosmic dust has a profound effect on the interpretation of observed spectral signatures and radiative transfer processes in a variety of astronomical objects. Dust is crucial to star formation processes, and understanding the dust at high redshift is vital to cosmological models and dark energy studies. To account properly for energy budgets in astrophysical environments requires an understanding of the physical properties of the dust, gained from several types of laboratory data: (1) absorbance spectra, which can be compared to observational spectra, and (2) reflectivity spectra, which may be used to derive (3) optical functions. However, quality laboratory data are not available for many of the compounds believed to exist in space, particularly at ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) wavelengths. This project will provide all three forms of UV-vis laboratory data for a suite of solid-state materials found in meteorites and in the condensation sequence. The major goals are: (1) Determine the spectral behavior of selected silicates, sulfides, oxides, glasses, and other materials that may be present in space; (2) Determine optical functions for these materials; and (3) Apply these data to outstanding questions in astronomy, and make all of the data available to the astronomical community.<br/><br/>This research will broaden the participation of under-represented groups and enhance the infrastructure for research and education. The synergistic, cross-disciplinary study involves scientists in astrophysics, mineral physics, and planetary science, using laboratory, observational, and theoretical modeling techniques. Laboratory fundamental research for astrophysics is at a critical stage and this work will train new U.S. researchers and students in this area, matching personnel with underutilized but available equipment.

0.410553,"This project aims to clarify the assembly histories of galaxies, focusing in particular on their stellar halos. In the current conceptual picture of structure formation in the early universe, small gravitationally bound systems dominate in number, and the present population of galaxies is formed by multiple mergers of these protogalactic objects. Cosmological simulations predict that the extended stellar components of galaxies are built up by the merging and tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies. Since orbital times are long in these regions, a memory of this accretion should persist in the form of coherent structures in space and/or velocity. The Principal Investigator and collaborators have identified and quantified these structures in the halo of the Milky Way. In this project they will carry out an observational program on the 6.5-meter Magellan telescope to map the faint, extended stellar halos in 4 nearby spiral galaxies, tripling the number of galaxies mapped to this depth. Using N-body simulations of dwarf galaxy accretion, they will develop quantitative measures of halo structure that are effective indicators of the accretion history. They will then apply the new metrics both to their new observations of external galaxies and to large-scale survey data on the halo of the Milky Way from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and from the Pan-STARRS 1 survey. The goal is to sensitively test theories of stellar halo formation. The project will involve the professional training and mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate students. The Principal Investigator will also participate in outreach through visits to elementary school classrooms and a coordinated effort to improve the astronomical content of the on-line reference Wikipedia."
0.045,"This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at Tufts University.<br/><br/>Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window onto fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory. Professor Olum's research will advance our knowledge of the cosmic string network as it would exist today and would have existed in the past under any specific cosmic string theory. In particular, it will lead to accurate information about the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings. This information will allow us to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if such gravitational waves are detected in the future. If they are not detected, it will enable us to set limits on the possibilities for cosmic strings, and thus on underlying theories of high-energy physics. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe. Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in the work and thus train future generations of research physicists. The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Olum will study the shape of cosmic string loops to determine how many cusps they have and to calibrate the signals that they might produce for comparison with observational limits on gravitational waves from pulsar timing. He will also study networks that might arise from cosmic strings with a low probability of reconnection when they intersect each other, as might be found in cosmic superstring theories."
0.06,"""This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).""<br/><br/>Cosmic strings connect fundamental theories of basic physics with observation of the universe on the largest scales. Cosmic strings are infinitesimally thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length. They can arise from symmetry breaking in field theory or they can be the fundamental strings of string theory or 1-dimensional ""D-branes"". They can produce observational signatures in the cosmic microwave background, in cosmic rays, in ultra-high-energy neutrinos, or in gravity waves. If cosmic strings are detected, they will provide a window onto fundamental physics and energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. To interpret a cosmic string observation or to set limits on cosmic string properties from non-observation requires a quantitative understanding of the cosmic string network. In particular, since most cosmic string signatures arise from string loops, it is vital to know the density, sizes, and shapes of the loops whose effects might be detected. Because of the highly nonlinear nature of cosmic string processes, accurate understanding of the string network requires numerical simulation.<br/>This project will develop a new parallel simulation code, using algorithms adapted to parallel computing, and with more flexibility in generating initial conditions and analyzing the simulation data than previous codes. Parallel computing will provide for a simulation volume hundreds, perhaps a thousand times larger than has been simulated before, and an increase in the simulated time interval of up to factor of 10. This will allow much more time for initial condition artifacts to be damped out and for the string network to assume its final scaling form, from which the important network parameters can be extracted.<br/>The project will have a broader impact through the involvement of graduate undergraduate students and through opportunities for students from under-represented groups to participate in research. Its results will be broadly disseminated through publication in journals and made available to the public on the World Wide Web. It will benefit society by further connecting studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature."
0.427637,"Despite significant advances in recent decades in our understanding of the evolution and internal structure of stars, many aspects of theory remain untested or have been shown to disagree with observations. Evolutionary models are widely used by astronomers to infer various properties of stars such as the masses, ages, or overall chemical abundances, but our confidence in these models is limited to some extent by those disagreements and by a lack of observational constraints. Carefully selected binary systems are ideal objects to test and validate theory through a comparison with accurate measurements of fundamental stellar quantities such as the stellar mass, the radius, the effective temperature, or the luminosity.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to obtain these measurements for a number of astrophysically important systems and to perform ""critical"" tests of stellar evolution theory, namely, tests that can distinguish between competing models and are able to rule out at least some of them. Only in this way can progress be made towards understanding in detail where theory fails and how stars work. Specific areas that will be tested are the theory of convection (mixing length theory, overshooting), internal structure (apsidal motion, including relativistic contributions), rotation, mass loss, and tidal evolution (rotational synchronization and orbit circularization due to tidal forces). This project will go beyond merely showing the overall agreement with one or another set of models. The goal is to provide so many observational constraints for a given binary system that only the most realistic sets of models (if any) may satisfy all the observations within the errors, simultaneously for both stellar components and at a single evolutionary age (since they are presumably coeval).<br/><br/>This project will focus on low-mass stars (which have highlighted many problems with theory), evolved stars (giants and subgiants) and very young (pre-main sequence) stars for which virtually no constraints are available, as well as stars with chemical compositions very different from the Sun (metal-poor). High quality spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric observations will be obtained and analyzed to make determinations of the absolute stellar properties with relative errors no larger than 1-2% in the case of the masses and radii, which is the current state-of-the-art.<br/><br/>The dissemination of the results to the scientific community mainly in the form of peer-reviewed publications is an integral part of this project. It is expected that this work will significantly advance our understanding of several poorly known areas of stellar astrophysics as indicated above. Improving theory will not only allow much more reliable determinations of parameters such as the ages of stars (old and young), which have profound cosmological implications, but it will also provide a more solid framework for the study of the origin and evolution of substellar objects such as brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets, which in recent years have become a subject of great interest for the public and scientists alike. This project will also provide excellent opportunities for training by integrating front-line research into the experience of learning.

The advance in simulation capability is also well timed for the start of operations of the first NSF-supported sustained petaflops supercomputer, Blue Waters.<br/><br/>Combining these software, hardware, and data advances, this project will simulate the formation and evolution of the first galaxies across the entire range of masses and luminosities observed, and compare the results to the data through simulated images and spectra. This will lead to inferences about the Population III initial mass function, feedback effects, the growth of supermassive black holes, and even the dark matter power spectrum, and place important constraints on the accretion rate of gas onto galaxies. The simulations will improve estimates of the escape of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium, and directly address whether high-redshift galaxies are capable of reionizing the Universe. This is the very first time such near-first-principles simulations are feasible, due to the convergence of petascale computing hardware, simulation software, and algorithmic advances, and also the first time that relevant observational constraints are being obtained.<br/><br/>Simulations at this scale have a strong impact on the astronomical community, the high performance computing community, and the larger science and technology-curious public. They drive the development of the hardware, software, and networking infrastructure. This project is one of six selected for first access to NSF's new petascale supercomputer, and the required code enhancements will be made generally available. There are also plans to include these scientific results in a new IMAX film by the Reuben H.Fleet Science Museum in Balboa Park, San Diego, anticipated in 2013."
0.28,"Cosmological measurements over the past ten years indicate that 23% of the matter in the<br/>Universe is dark matter. The favored candidates for dark matter are massive particles which weakly interact with neutrons and protons. Several experiments are underway to detect dark matter by measuring the total energy a dark matter particle transfers to a nucleus in an elastic collision. The proposal is to build a detector that will measure both the direction and energy of the recoiling nucleus. Since the earth moves through a static halo of dark matter, the ability to determine the apparent direction from which the dark matter arrives gives this scheme a decisive advantage over experiments which simply measure the nuclear recoil energy. <br/><br/>Two approaches are proposed. In one scheme (using CF4 gas), the image of the recoil is determined by imaging the photons emitted in the amplification process using a CCD camera. The MIT-BU group has demonstrated this method in a 0.05 liter detector and the proposal is to now construct a 250 l detector capable of making a scientifically competitive measurement. The use of CF4 also gives this scheme unique access to spin dependent interactions between dark matter and neutrons and protons. <br/><br/>In the second scheme (using CS2 gas), charges collected on the wires of the amplification system determine the direction of the recoil. This method has been demonstrated by the DRIFT collaboration, which operates detectors in the Boulby Mine, and the proposal is to make a major improvement of the electronics in the DRIFT detectors to make them scientifically competitive. The two approaches complement each other by searching for spin-dependent (CF4) and spin-independent (CS2) interactions.<br/><br/>In the area of Broader Impacts, although the proposal is for a dark matter detector, the same system could be used for detection of low energy neutrons and may be valuable for radiography, reactor safety or cargo screening. A key element is the large charge coupled device (CCD) camera and optical system."
0.235996,"Dr. Kerstin Perez is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Columbia University. The current cosmological paradigm includes two significant and unknown entities called ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy."" The physics of the Universe is dominated by their presence even though their nature remains unknown. Current investigations into the identity of dark matter focus on finding entirely new massive particles. Many dark matter search experiments are currently planned or ongoing, and many of them are challenged by the large background signal from conventional astrophysical processes and a vast array of signatures that could indicate a dark matter interaction. This project, part of the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) experiment, aims to characterize the dark matter by detecting the low-energy subatomic particles predicted to be created as dark matter particles self-annihilate in the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy. The postdoctoral fellow of this award will lead the commissioning of the detector system that would detect these particles in this project.<br/><br/>The strength of the GAPS experiment is that it promises to provide an essentially background-free signature of dark matter, and the anticipated measurements will probe large portions of the theoretical parameter spaces of both supersymmetry and extra-dimensional theories, the leading models of dark matter production, and will complement and extend the reach of current experiments. Layers of semiconducting Si(Li) tracking detectors with excellent time and energy resolution are essential to the success of the GAPS detection and background rejection scheme. GAPS will utilize over 1000 of these detectors, and thus a consistent procedure for qualification and calibration will be the bridge between the ideal experimental design and its final performance. The fellow will spearhead the analysis of data from a prototype balloon flight and will lead the commissioning and calibration of these detectors.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component. The fellow will work with the Columbia University Double Discovery Center (DDC) to implement a laboratory course and mentoring program aimed at encouraging underrepresented students to pursue an education in a scientific field. The fellow will establish a laboratory science course for junior high school students with lessons based on research pursued by members of the Columbia University community. A key aspect of this course will be to confront students' preconceived notions of where a science education leads by promoting interaction with role models from science backgrounds who have pursued a variety of professions."

Collaborating with the group will be Dr. Gustavo Bruzual, Director of CIDA and his partners. The combination of Schmidt optics, the equatorial site provided by the Venezuelan Schmidt, and CCD drift scan techniques, should result in an uniquely powerful astronomical survey machine. Potential scientific applications which will be made possible by the CCD camera will cover the entire range of modern observational astrophysics, from searches for nearby brown dwarfs, to studies of the structure of our galaxy, to the cosmological implications of the distribution of the most distant quasars. Several technical issues must be resolved prior to the installation of the CCD. In particular, the geometry required by the camera on the telescope, and the algorithms for handling the large expected data rates must be considered. The objective of this proposal is to conduct the necessary studies to resolve these issues. ***"

These aims have been longstanding challenges to general relativists, but now mathematical methods are becoming available which may allow genuine progress on such fundamental problems. Earlier global existence results for spacetimes with high symmetry may now be extendible to very much larger families of solutions and new techniques, such as the application of the method of ""multiple scales"", may provide the needed tools for the analytical study of spacetime singularities. The basic approach of this research will be to try to extend the range of applicability of the established mathematical methods, such as the use of light-cone and higher order energy estimates, to larger and less symmetric families of spacetimes, and at the same time, to develop new methods, such as the expansion techniques alluded to above.

0.324303,"Understanding the growth of galaxies and galaxy clusters is one of the most significant outstanding problems in our knowledge of the universe. On the largest scales, the universe has a filamentary structure, with gas and dark matter interweaving in a series of threads. The gradual flow and build-up of gas along this ""cosmic web"" ultimately leads to the formation of protogalaxies and protoclusters. Despite this, the precise manner in which galaxies and their clusters eventually form remains poorly understood. A breakthrough step, enabled by this research, is to connect and synthesize our knowledge of the gas in the outskirts of galaxies with that in galaxy clusters.<br/><br/>This program will address a number of critical questions regarding the structure and flow of gas by using a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations. The PI will principally use the Adaptive Refinement Tree (ART) code, but will also compare the results of these simulations with detailed multi-wavelength observations of clusters and the circumgalactic medium. The work will lead to new insights into the baryon budgets in galaxies and clusters, the impact of galactic feedback on extended halo gas, the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution, and the quenching of star formation in galaxies. <br/><br/>The PI will also develop a hands-on computational astrophysics curriculum to expand minority involvement in computational science, in collaboration with the Science, Technology, and Research Scholars (STARS) program at Yale University. Furthermore, the data products of the simulations will be made available via online publicly-accessible databases."
0.795385,"Astrophysical and cosmological data point convincingly to a large component of cold dark matter in the Universe, but the nature of that dark matter is still unknown. Axions are possible dark matter candidates. This award will support the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment - High Frequency (ADMX-HF), which searches for Axions in the galactic halo. ADMX-HF extends the range of the ADMX experiment to the higher frequency band that probes both Axions with trace mass and Axions with sufficient mass to account for all the matter density in the Universe. ADMX-HF is therefore a uniquely powerful probe of Axion dark matter. Several new technologies have been developed in support of ADMX-HF. These have potential applications for high-precision measurements in other fields. The group has a history of employing undergraduates in the research, which provides training and experience in the areas of experimental control and data analysis software, mechanical and electronic assembly.<br/><br/>Axions in the galactic halo can be converted into a narrow-band microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. ADMX-HF is a small microwave cavity experiment that serves as both a pathfinder to take first data in the 10 to 100 micro-electronvolt range and as a test-bed for developing new cavities and quantum-limited photon detection schemes that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform. All major systems have been constructed and are being integrated into the experiment with full commissioning to begin soon. During this award period ADMX-HF should transition to routine data-taking operation and probe the 16.5 to 66 micro-electronvolt range, bracketing the mass of the axion that corresponds to saturation of the matter density of the universe."

0.199276,"The core of this project is the setting up of a research network, initially between four researchers, in three institutions, supporting interchange between them (Robert Adler, Technion, Jonathan Taylor, Stanford, Shmuel Weinberger and Keith Worsley, Chicago) and, more importantly, their students. They will study problems related to the geometric characterization of random structures, such as topological invariants of excursion (nodal) sets of random fields and learning the homotopy and homeomorphism types of manifolds in the presence of noise and developing techniques for quantifying the statistical accuracy of the resulting estimates. Whereas previous work on random field geometry has concentrated on characteristics coming from differential topology, such as Lipshitz-Killing curvatures (which include the Euler characteristic) this project will concentrate on characteristics coming from algebraic topology, involving homology-invariant concepts such as the number of connected components, Betti numbers, and other related invariants. Furthermore, while previous work in these areas was in the setting of Riemannian manifolds, it is planned to extend this to allowing non-Riemannian metrics even on smooth manifolds. In manifold learning this is important due to the fact that in some applications natural measures of closeness underlying the context of a data set can well be non-Riemannian. In the context of random fields, it may open new doors in the study of purely non-Gaussian fields, such as stable fields, where the natural geometry on the parameter manifold induced by the field is non-Riemannian.<br/><br/>The motivation for this project, which links algebraic topology, probability, and pure and applied statistics comes from both its intrinsic mathematical interest and from a wealth of applications, from areas as broadly spaced as the statistical analysis of fMRI brain images, high dimensional data analysis in computer science, and cosmological projects such as the COBE and WMAP experiments and the Sloan digital sky survey. The four PIs come from a variety of intellectual backgrounds and are specialists with different, but complementary technical skills. Not only will this project join these skills, but over the next two years a number of other researchers will be added to the project, strengthening, among other aspects, its international component and extending to the training of young scientists in the US."
0.078,"Shubin proposes to study L^2 holomorphic functions and L^2 Dolbeault cohomology on non-compact manifolds with boundary. He will use Von Neumann algebra techniques to further develop the L^2 Oka-Grauert theory on complex manifolds M with pseudoconvex or q-convex boundary bM admitting a holomorphic action of a Lie group G on M with a compact quotient M/G. He plans to investigate existence of non-trivial L^2 holomorphic functions on M for concrete Lie groups G which act freely on M with compact quotient M/G. In this way it might be possible to describe the class of groups G for which the existence of non-trivial L^2 holomorphic functions is guaranteed. The situation when there is no group action will be also considered with the purpose of finding geometric conditions which guarantee existence of non-trivial L^2 holomorphic functions. Techniques from several complex variables are similar to those appearing in linear and non-linear partial differential equations that describe cosmological models (through twistors) and free boundary problems, providing models for plasma in tokamaks by methods of Helmholtz and Kirchhoff. Investigation of these models can lead to important discoveries in thermonuclear reactions which are our main hope for the future source of cheap energy."

0.0609,"0089550<br/>Bigi<br/><br/>This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Professor Ikaros Bigi of the University of Notre Dame and Professor Ichirou Sanda of Nagoya University in Japan. The researchers will be researching the theory of heavy flavor decays in the era of beauty factories. CP (Charge/Particle) violation constitutes one of the central mysteries of the successful Standard Model of high-energy physics. CP is the violation of the combined conservation laws associated with charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) by the weak nuclear force, which is responsible for reactions such as the decay of atomic nuclei. Parity, or space inversion, is the reflection in the origin of the space coordinates of a particle or particle system (in three dimension). Parity conservation means that left and right and up and down are indistinguishable in the sense that an atomic nucleus throws off decay products up as often as down and left as often as right. For years it was assumed that charge conjugation and parity were exact symmetries of elementary processes, namely those involving electromagnetic, strong, and weak interactions. Thirty-six years after it was discovered that parity was violated in the weak interaction beta decay, it has not yet been established in any other system. At the same time it is of great cosmological significance as essential for generating the baryon number of the universe. Since theory predicts large CP asymmetries in the decays of beauty hadrons, dedicated experiments are starting to collect data in both the U.S. and Japan. New theoretical technologies have been developed to deal quantitatively with the weak decays of beauty hadrons. One crucial element in this progress has been maintaining close contact with experiments. The promise of this strategy has grown even stronger with huge amounts of new data. <br/><br/>The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The researchers' goal is to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon of matter-antimatter asymmetry, so obvious in nature, but not quite understood. Results of the research could impact on some discovery in the field of B-hadron physics. This research advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.

Theoretical models of disk formation have had substantial success in explaining many of the basic features of disk galaxies. The Tully-Fisher relation, the exponential surface brightness profiles, and the rotation curves of disk galaxies all can be reproduced by models of a simple spherical collapse of a rotating gas cloud. However, the recent discovery that all thin disk galaxies are embedded within an additional thick disk component suggests that the existing picture is too simple. Either this pervasive thick disk component captures a distinct phase in the initial collapse of the galaxy, or it tracks the early hierarchical build-up of the galaxy (a phase absent from existing models). With this award, Dr. Dalcanton will provide the critical measurements and the theoretical foundations necessary for incorporating the creation of thick disks into models of disk galaxy formation. By measuring the kinematics, ages, and metallicities of a large sample of thick disks, she will be able to cleanly distinguish among several scenarios for the formation of thick disks and the early evolution of disk galaxies. She will also carry out a systematic program of simulations and analytic calculations to derive the cosmological implications of the previously unexplored thick disk population. <br/><br/>In addition to her work in training the next generation of scientists, Dr. Dalcanton will design and execute a novel program to capture and reinforce the scientific interest of middle school girls, before their attrition from scientific, mathematical, and technological fields begins.

Their presence refashioned the thermodynamic behavior of the gas collecting in the first bound cosmological objects, and catalyzed the transition from the Population III star formation mode into the pervasive, metal-enriched, clustered, Population I & II mode that heralded the epoch of the galaxies. The behavior of metals in the early Universe was stochastic, inhomogeneous, and subject to nonlinear and nonlocal feedback effects. This project will explore the complexity of metal dispersal by studying the transport and mixing of metals and dust in the first structures. It also targets the nucleosynthetic footprint of pre-galactic metal enrichment in the nearby Universe. The researchers will continue their successful use of large-scale numerical simulations to model the multi-scale build-up of structure, focusing on the transport of metals from their sources in the first supernovae into the cosmic web, their mixing with the primordial gas, their fallback into the first galaxies, and finally, their influence on the fragmentation of the proto-galactic medium and star formation. Importantly, the team will mirror the simulations using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics and adaptive mesh refinement methods, to constrain any numerical systematics. They will characterize nucleosynthetic heterogeneities in the first galaxies, caused by fine-grain mixing of proto star-cluster gas driven by turbulence, and consider the observational characteristics of these first galaxies with an eye to future observations.

Many<br/>of the specific topics of the lectures of the conference have<br/>both their origins in and applications to mathematical physics,<br/>from the Lagrangian description of classical mechanical systems<br/>(1800's) to problems in string theory (1990's). The mathematical<br/>analysis of singularities provides important information for not<br/>only these well-established applications but also for new<br/>singularities arising from biological and computational problems."
0.173256,"To study galaxies during the cosmic era of maximum star formation and supermassive black hole growth requires observing them at great distances, corresponding to cosmological redshifts between 1.5 and 3.0. The visible light emitted by these galaxies carries information about their stellar and gaseous contents; owing to the redshift, this light is observed at infrared wavelengths. The new, NSF-funded, Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I telescope represents a major development for the study of these galaxies, offering increases in sensitivity and survey efficiency by factors of approximately 5 and 100, respectively. This project, the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey, will chart the evolution of the rest-frame optical spectra for approximately 2000 galaxies between 1.5 and 3.5, more than an order of magnitude improvement over existing surveys. The project will make use of 44 nights allocated on the Keck I telescope through 2016, and will survey three well-studied regions of the sky already having extensive multi-wavelength datasets. By combining new and existing data, the proposing team will characterize the star formation and accreting black hole activity in distant galaxies, their masses, contents and structures, and the manner in which baryonic matter passes through them. In collaboration with theorists, the MOSDEF team will use these results to test and inform forefront models of galaxy evolution. The MOSDEF spectra will be publicly released to the astronomical community to enable additional investigations. Graduate and undergraduate students will be supported by the project and involved in the research, and team members will develop pedagogical resources for K-12 teachers on the key aspects of the science and techniques."
0.104999,"Cowan, John AST 96-18332 Dr. Cowan will continue research into the formation, evolution, and age of the heavy elements, with particular emphasis on the formation of the neutron capture s- and r-process elements. His research utilizes a dynamic r-process code, which incorporates the most current nuclear data, in combination with observational data for the most metal-poor stars of the Galactic halo. His theoretical studies will define the environments, both nuclear and astrophysical, in which these heavy elements were formed and provide insight into the conditions that existed early in the history of the Galaxy and into the nature of the progenitors of the halo stars. Closely related efforts to investigate the r- and s-process production as a function of stellar metallicity will offer constraints on early Galactic timescales for stellar formation. Dr. Cowan will also continue studies of the use of long-lived radioactive chronometers (especially Th and U) and the development of more realistic chemical evolution models to provide more accurate estimates of the age of the Galaxy, and constrain cosmological age estimates. ***"

The specific goal is a consistent quantification<br/>of the differences among these supernovae (including reliable line identifications) to reveal the<br/>range and distribution of their spectroscopic properties. Of particular interest is whether they form a<br/>continuous spread of sub-types or break down into distinct subgroups. The analysis will be<br/>performed by comparing observed supernovae spectra with the output of a parameterized supernova<br/>spectrum synthesis code (Synow) developed at the University of Oklahoma. Secondary goals<br/>include a similar study of Type Ic supernovae spectra, using Synow to interpret spectra of quasistellar<br/>objects with broad absorption lines, and the further development of the online supernova<br/>spectra/photometry database (SUSPECT).<br/>Support and training of a graduate student is included and undergraduates will aid in the research<br/>effort. The computer program used in the analysis (Synow) will be made available to anyone who<br/>wishes to use it. The development and expansion of the SUSPECT online supernovae database will also<br/>be continued.

0.329138,"Vacuum (Casimir) energy in quantum field theory is of interest in the physics community and its connections with some mathematical topics in spectral theory and asymptotics of differential operators have recently become clearer. Thus this collaboration between physicists and mathematicians is an effective approach to further progress. The investigators intend to build on the results of their previous collaboration to make progress in two areas: (1) Gravitational significance of vacuum energy: The previous work has demonstrated that vacuum energy gravitates just as does any other form of energy. For plane geometries the divergences renormalize the masses of the material bodies confining the field. This analysis will be extended to general geometries. This requires the mathematical theory of the asymptotics of (Schwartz) distributions as well as sound physics. (2) Improved calculational methods: In the presence of curved surfaces, higher-order corrections are hard to calculate in classical-path analyses of vacuum energy and eigenvalue distribution. In the presence of sharp edges or corners (other than right angles) the semiclassical methods break down quite seriously (diffraction). The project will develop and apply more fundamental and accurate analyses, known as multiple reflection or multiple scattering. Previous success in treating the forces between dielectric bodies by multiple scattering will be extended and applications to practical configurations such as noncontact gears and multilayer surfaces are being pursued. Also, the multiple-reflection expansion will be used for accurate calculation of vacuum energy density and pressure near curved surfaces and edges and corners.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project stems partly from its interdisciplinary nature. The subject not only combines physics and mathematics, but also combines topics within physics and within mathematics that are ripe for productive interaction. Vacuum energy is relevant both to new nanotechnological devices and to cosmological issues (dark energy). Mathematically, the connection between periodic-orbit theory and vacuum energy has only recently been exploited, and the implications of vacuum energy for spectral theory have barely been explored. Undergraduate and graduate student research assistants from both physics and mathematics will be recruited and their educations will be enhanced, and a diverse student population is being trained. The project will also foster future research interactions with other fields (gravitational implications, nanotechnology, quantum graphs, spectral geometry)."
0.229931,"Determining the chemical composition of galaxies is crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. Standard techniques, utilizing emission line spectra of the diffuse interstellar gas (specifically HII regions), is plagued by large and poorly understood systematic uncertainties. This project will develop a new, and potentially transformative, approach based on near-infrared spectroscopy of individual red supergiant stars. The output of these stars peaks in the J-band, where the spectra are rich in atomic lines. New multi-object infrared spectrographs on 10-meter-class telescopes will be able to obtain sufficient resolution to derive accurate abundances to distances of 10 megaparsecs. The purpose of this project is to develop, validate and exploit this new technique, in several steps: (1) The technique will be tested in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, against complementary techniques using HII region and blue supergiant star spectra; (2) Local Group galaxies of extremely low metallicity (NGC 3109, WLM, IC 1613) and the spirals M31 and M33 will be studied and compared with results from blue supergiants; (3) the technique will be applied to spiral galaxies beyond the Local Group out to a few megaparsecs (NGC 300, NGC 2403, M81). Accurate abundances and abundance gradients will be obtained, allowing constraints on the evolutionary states and histories of star forming galaxies, as well as an assessment of the reliability of H II region techniques. The method will also be extended to super-star clusters, which contain many dozens of red supergiants dominating the J-band flux, and which may be useful as cosmological abundance indicators at even larger distances. Eventually, this technique may be best exploited by the next generation of large telescopes, achieving abundance measurements out to 100 megaparsecs, a substantial volume of the local universe. The project will support the work of one graduate student, who will participate in international collaborations. Results will be incorporated into education and public outreach activities conducted by the Principal Investigator."
0.1803,"The University of Florida group will carry out research in theoretical gravitational physics which will involve the application of analytic and numerical techniques to the study of black holes, compact stars and clusters, cosmological problems, and quantum aspects of gravity. Binary systems consisting of two black holes might form fairly often in galactic nuclei and become important sources of gravitational radiation. The evolution and emission properties of such binaries will be studied with new techniques. The study of neutron stars will continue. One activity will imploy further the Butterworth-Ipser numerical code to decipher observable structural properties of rapidly rotating relativistic neutron stars. Another will employ new ""Eulerian"" techniques to study nonaxisymmetric pulsations and stability, with emphasis on the maximum rotation rates expected to be observed. Star clusters, which possibly form in galactic nuclei and collapse to massive black holes, will be studied, with the focus on their stability properties. Estimates will be made of the distribution of dark matter in galaxies to assess the viability of local experimental detection of dark matter. Tools such as path integrals and spinoral techniques will be used to study quantum-gravity problems such as the early Universe and late stages of black-hole evaporation."
0.318449,"AST-0407308<br/>Szalay<br/><br/>This research will address several major questions related to the large-scale distribution of galaxies, in particular by measuring the fluctuation spectrum of the galaxy distribution on very large scales, which overlap with measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations. A promising technique introduced a few years ago has been turned into a practical tool, which provides optimal weighting of the data for each individual mode of the power spectrum, and has so far successfully provided very tight constraints on cosmological parameters. The current project may even detect the existence of baryon bumps, which enable measurement of the angular diameter distance relation, and constrain the equation of state of the dark energy. This study will enhance the effectiveness of the SkyServer, a web site constantly in use by high schools and the general public, and will further promote collaboration with the Hands-On Universe project, where students can do follow-up observations, or look up properties of something interesting seen in an observation."
0.045871,"Precisely how galaxies initially form and how they change throughout their lifetimes are among the least understood problems in astrophysics, and understanding the formation and life cycle of galaxies is key to developing the broadest astronomical perspective on how the Universe evolved to its present state. Many projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries. This project is focused on understanding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to uncover its role in the life cycle of galaxies.<br/><br/>PI Churchill will expand his previous Broader Impact program based upon his course ""Into the Final Frontier."" This course links students to Space Port America and the growing aerospace and tourism industry rapidly growing in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Special emphasis is placed on forging STEM related opportunities for minority students, which comprise 45% of New Mexico State's student population. Two graduate students will be supported in New Mexico. PI Charlton plans to transform her successful science fiction, interactive, web astronomy course into a video game to teach K--12 students, while achieving STEM astronomy standards for the state of Pennsylvania. This project will support two pre-selected skilled and talented students to construct the game and integrate it into local schools. One graduate student will be supported in Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>The CGM is understood through observations and analysis of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars. However, being blind to the actual properties of the absorbing gas, present day analysis methods are uncalibrated. That is, our cumulative knowledge of the CGM and its role in galaxy evolution is based upon a host of implicit and explicit assumptions that remain untested or quantified. Using the Eulerian hydrodynamic N-body cosmological simulation code hydroART, the team will use the quasar absorption line technique, coupled with direct analysis of the simulations, to study highly-detailed simulated galaxies with various star formation and feedback physical models. The galaxies will range in viral halo mass from 10.5 < log(M/Msun) < 12.5 and in redshift from z ~ 0-3. The team aims to address these questions: (1) What is the relationship between the gas phase structures in and surrounding galaxies and the physical model for star formation and stellar feedback? (2) How well do models that yield galaxies matching global galaxy properties also match the observed properties of the gaseous reservoirs? (3) How does the CGM regulate the baryon cycle and galaxy evolution? (4) Do current analysis methods of absorption lines yield inferred gas properties (metallicities, spatial-kinematics distributions, gas phases, and gas reservoir masses) that are consistent with the gas being probed in the simulations? (5) What are the quantitative relationships between inferred gas properties from observational analysis and the gas actually giving rise to the absorption? (6) What are the implications and how do they change our understanding of the baryon cycle and galaxy evolution?"
0.96,"The UWMLSC group will contribute several critical elements to create a low-latency streaming on-line search for transient gravitational waves, such as those produced during the coalescence of binary neutron stars or black holes, the most anticipated gravitational wave signal. Among the data analysis elements we will create are the streaming data calibration system, a low-latency system for determining data quality and glitch vetoing, and on-line searches for signals from inspiralling compact binaries and for generic unmodeled bursts. Such a system to rapidly identify signals will be an essential element of gravitational wave science in the Advanced Detector Era, and will enable multi-messenger astronomy in which observations of several kinds (gravitational waves; electromagnetic waves; high energy particles) are synthesized to obtain a detailed understanding of the sources of the most cataclysmic events in the universe. Gravitational wave astronomy will reveal the inner mechanism of the mysterious gamma ray bursts, will provide a means to measure the population of black holes and determine the channel by which massive black holes are grown, and will probe the fundamental nature of matter above nuclear densities. New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, which will complement existing observations. Gravitational wave observations will also provide sensitive tests of Einstein's General Relativity in ways in which it has not yet been scrutinized. The opening of the gravitational wave window onto the universe can potentially evince exotic objects such as naked singularities, cosmic strings, or unexpected physics. We must be ready to address these scientific challenges as our new astronomical facilities come into operation. To this end, this award will support work that may result in the first gravitational wave discoveries of compact binary coalescence, provide rapid sky localization to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, observe black hole formation channels and probe fundamental properties of black holes through their quasi-normal modes of oscillation, scan the sky to find undiscovered rapidly rotating neutron stars and to learn about their properties, test cherished principles of gravitation such as the no-hair and cosmic-censorship conjectures, and seek new exotic and unexpected phenomena.<br/><br/>Our work supports the creation of critical components of a system that will allow the rapid transmittal of gravitational wave observations to the entire community of astronomers, and facilitates the integration of gravitational wave science into the broader field of astrophysics. The group has a solid track record of educating new researchers; this project will have a broad impact by training a new generation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members in gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as conveying the excitement of this budding branch of astronomy to the community through outreach efforts such as the UWM Planetarium."
0.266844,"Anywhere that there is a fluid in motion, whether liquid or gas, there will be turbulence. These disturbances to the flow can be very significant, but their possibly profound effect on the formation of galaxies out of the cosmic gas remains an area of mystery in our fundamental understanding of how the Universe evolves. This work seeks to correct this lack, using high powered computers to carry out novel numerical simulations with very high resolution. For the first time, pretty well all of the physics involved in forming stars within galaxies will be included. The calculations will be intimately connected with telescope data, both checking the computer results and helping to understand the observations. The new ideas will also be useful for other studies of turbulent fluids.<br/><br/>Cosmic gas flows have high velocities, span enormous scales, and are highly turbulent, but the possibly profound effects of turbulence on galaxy formation are largely unexplored. This project is a systematic exploration of turbulence and its effects on accretion flows, star formation, and the structure of galaxies, in self-consistent cosmological simulations using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Part of the work will implement and test a novel model for sub-grid scale turbulence and use it to estimate local turbulent stresses. This model will be used to add new physically-motivated prescriptions for star formation into the galaxy formation simulations, incorporating a rich set of physical processes thought to be critical for comparison with observations, including modeling of molecular hydrogen, chemical enrichment and evolution, dust formation and destruction, radiative transfer of ionizing and far-ultraviolet radiation, star formation, and stellar feedback with radiation pressure and cosmic rays. Observational comparisons will test and inform the theoretical models, while the simulation results will help to understand the data. Scientific results will include quantifying the effects of turbulence on the cold accretion gas flows onto galaxies, assessing the relative contribution of dynamical drivers of turbulence, and quantifying the effects of turbulence on the density structure of the gas. The emphasis on observational comparisons will make this study particularly valuable for interpreting the results from current and future facilities. Both the methods and the results will be of value for other simulations and for semi-analytic models. The simulations also lend themselves well to high-fidelity, scientifically-accurate visualizations well suited to the high resolution environment of full-dome planetarium projectors, but of value to all planetaria."
0.464112,"Cosmic phenomena display a broad range of time-dependent behavior. Until recently, resources were sufficiently limited that only selected populations could be extensively monitored in the time domain, but modern telescopes and detectors can survey cosmic volumes much more quickly than before. As a consequence, synoptic time-domain astronomy - the study of cosmic variability across sizeable populations - is becoming a dominant mode of study. Such surveys provide not simply more data, but a different kind of data, requiring a new approach to statistical learning capable of extracting information from large ensembles of multivariate, irregularly and asynchronously sampled light curves. Astronomy is not the only discipline facing this change in the nature of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) is a rapidly growing area of statistics that addresses inference from datasets that sample ensembles of related functions. The present interdisciplinary project will use FDA concepts and techniques to develop new methods to address several problem areas of survey data analysis, from astrophysical modeling of variability using catalog data, to the detection of variable and transient sources in images. One main application will be the analysis of light curves of periodic variable stars using functional mixed effects models. In particular, Cepheid variable stars are a foundation of the cosmic distance scale, and the hope is that these new functional models can provide more accurate brightness estimates and therefore ease limits on how accurately important cosmological parameters can be measured. Other problems well suited to FDA methods include the detection of dim intermittent signals, and the classification of sources from features in their light curves.<br/><br/>The team includes experts in astronomy and in statistics, and will pursue innovative research in both disciplines. This research will enhance their partnership by direct collaboration, by dissemination of results in both communities, and by training a graduate student in information sciences to work on problems in astronomy. The methods produced will improve the science return on the large investments being made in astronomical surveys. The investigators are also involved with the Penn State University's interdisciplinary Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers, helping to train young astronomers in advanced statistics and machine learning methods."
0.248288,"This project will explore and develop a new method, based on the mathematical definitions of discrepancy and discrepancy sensitivity (DS), of quantifying sample point contribution to sample uniformity in the entire input/output domain, and the resulting strategies for the design of computer experiments (DoCE). Essentially, DS quantifies the change in sample point uniformity due to the addition of new simulation sample points. The project will aim to derive ""DS fields"" to efficiently locate a new sample point, develop DS strategies to best choose the next N simulation points, and investigate a number of open questions integral to effective use of DS for DoCE. The expected results are innovative algorithms for efficiently choosing sample points for response surface exploration, propagation of uncertainty through complex systems, and design optimization.<br/><br/>Whether for model validation, design optimization or reliability analysis, it is difficult to efficiently choose sample points for computer experiments in the presence of uncertainty. Even with recent computational advances, simulation of complex uncertain systems taxes today's most capable computers. Thus, methods are required to select which simulations will provide the most useful information given a limited computational budget. Such problems are widespread in science and engineering, where physical testing is often impractical for financial, safety, policy or other pragmatic reasons, and include high-priority applications in accident investigation, protein modeling, projectile penetration, cosmological models, and complex system reliability. Some approaches exist for choosing sample points, but lack quantitative measures of ""information"" added by new sample points, particularly in the output space."
0.428957,"This project will carry out a detailed study of the globular cluster (GC) populations of elliptical and lenticular galaxies in order to address key questions in galaxy structure and formation, specifically: (i) What are the masses, angular momenta, orbital structures, and metallicities of early-type galaxies? (ii) What is the distribution of dark matter associated with them? (iii) How are their inner and outer regions assembled, and are these processes decoupled? (iv) How does their assembly depend on mass and environment? (v) Do the observations agree with theoretical models of galaxy formation? And, (vi) can the primordial formation sites of GCs be identified? The study will be comprised of (1) a detailed, systematic observational survey of 25 early-type galaxies and their GC systems out to very large galactocentric radii, complemented with field star and planetary nebulae data; (2) dynamical modeling to recover mass and orbital information; and (3) comparisons to cosmological simulations of galaxy and GC formation. The project will support the work and professional mentoring of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. The proposing team will release the data and survey results as a publicly accessible database, and will also continue and expand their education and public outreach partnership with the Science Buddies organization."
0.114683,"The proposed research will focus on finding a theory beyond the standard model of elementary particle physics that will be capable of explaining quantities such as the pattern of quark and lepton masses. String theory is a potential candidate theory to solve this problem, however the theory has many degenerate ground states labeled by the value of the moduli fields. Thus the predictability of the masses problem is replaced by being able to determine the value of the moduli fields. The goal of this research effort is to compute the value of all the moduli fields in a realistic model. The approach is to introduce warped space times that naturally generate large hierarchies of physical scales. The PI proposes to determine the properties of the background geometry of string compactifications in the presence of fluxes. This might make it possible to determine the nature of broken supersymmetry and allow a determination of the cosmological constant."
0.359953,"AST-9987391<br/>Dappen, Werner<br/>The PI proposes to develop a unified equation of state for stellar interior computations. Such models are the foundation of stellar astronomy, and they provide the basis for understanding the structure of normal stars, as well as models for later stages of stellar evolution. The main goal of the project is to reconcile inconsistencies that currently exist between two competing approaches to determining the interior structure of the Sun. The PIs will use direct comparisons between the their interior models and GONG solar oscillation data. This should provide firm tests of the derived the equation of state, at least in low density regions. The results may help improve the determination of the Sun's helium abundance, a value that has substantial impact on stellar models in general and on the cosmological origins of helium. They also have the potential to improve model calculations for other stellar evolutionary stages, such as low density giant stars to high density white dwarf stars.<br/>Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).<br/>***"

The observations include two all-sky photometric and spectroscopic surveys of galaxies to measure the large-scale bulk flow of galaxies. Also planned is a detailed statistical comparison of the large-scale distribution of galaxies of different morphological types to constrain physical models for the relatite distribution of galaxies and dark matter.

0.392975,"AST-0807381<br/>Spitkovsky<br/><br/>Acceleration of particles in collisionless shocks is at the heart of most models of nonthermal phenomena in the Universe, including pulsar wind nebulae, active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and supernova remnants. The conversion of flow energy into relativistic particles is usually attributed to the first-order Fermi mechanism, but this is not well understood. This project will construct a self-consistent theory of shock acceleration by performing the first large-scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of astrophysical collisionless shocks. The PIC method is the most fundamental ab initio approach to plasma dynamics that is able to resolve directly the complex microphysics of plasma instabilities, particle scattering, and magnetic field generation near shocks. Specific questions to be addressed include: 1) Do collisionless shocks generate significant magnetic fields that can survive far downstream? 2) What fraction of shocked particles is injected into the Fermi mechanism? 3) What is the effect of high-energy particles on shock hydrodynamics and magnetic field amplification? 4) What mechanisms cause equilibration between particle species in shocks? This study will be a definitive test of the prevailing hypothesis that Fermi acceleration in collisionless shocks is the origin of high energy cosmic rays and nonthermal particles in a variety of astrophysical sources.<br/><br/>The results will be of broad significance to observers, experimentalists, and theorists involved with experiments to study high-energy astrophysical and cosmological sources. The research integrates research and education by involving graduate and undergraduate students, and postdocs, training in numerical modeling and visualization of multiscale systems.

0.35643,"AST-0507521<br/>Cen<br/><br/>It is well established that gravitational instability is the dominant force driving the formation of baryonic structures. However, feedback processes on the intergalactic medium (IGM) from star formation are not well understood, although observationally the phenomenon of galactic super-winds (GSW) is common in both low redshift starburst galaxies and high redshift Lyman break galaxies. Lack of an adequate treatment of GSW and other important physical processes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations hampers a full understanding of the evolution of the IGM. This research will carry out adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations with all likely relevant physical processes carefully treated, to compute more precisely the evolution of the IGM, and specifically, the warm-hot IGM (WHIM) at low redshift and the Lyman alpha forest at moderate redshift. This will produce a detailed characterization of the distribution of the WHIM, allowing future observational determination of the fraction of the cosmic baryons in this state. It will also help to quantify systematic errors, again allowing future observational constraints on the matter power spectrum to be accurate enough to shed useful light on inflationary theories. This research will set up an adequate framework to interpret the vast observational database on evolution of the IGM, in a physically self-consistent fashion.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include continuing an effective outreach program to the general public, using visualizations presented through effective channels, such as at the Rose-Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History, and public television programs such as Nova."
0.373888,"Dr. David Spergel (Princeton University) will use archival measurements of optical dust polarization to 2000 stars in the galactic halo to generate a polarization template map for microwave background studies.

The dust polarization measurements will also be used to study the properties of dust grains, to measure the amplitude and spectrum of magnetic field turbulence in the galactic disk and to fix the zero-point of the dust extinction maps.<br/><br/>The dust polarization measurements will help cosmologists working to detect primordial gravitational waves. These gravitational waves were produced during the first moments of the big bang. Their detection would be of broad interest to both scientists and the general public. This research program will lead to the release of dust template maps that will be widely used by many polarization experiments now under development. The improved measurements of the zero-point in dust extinction maps would be widely used in extragalactic studies. This research program will also train undergraduate and graduate students.

0.240721,"Advances in the study of cosmic reionization affect many fields, from the thermal evolution of the Lyman-alpha forest to the properties of galaxies over a large range of redshifts. Because the observational constraints are limited, theoretical modeling and numerical simulation play a relatively larger part in reionization studies than in other areas. Computational performance at the peta scale is well matched to the needs of a realistic reionization simulation, so that substantial progress can be expected in the next several years. The present research will culminate in simulations that combine large computational volumes with fully self-consistent physical modeling, providing important insights into reionization itself and into the evolution of galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters. The simulation results will be compared with existing approximate numerical and analytical schemes, to test the physical fidelity of customarily adopted approximations.<br/><br/>This project is an excellent vehicle for the professional training of a graduate student, and the results will be useful to a large community of scientists, from pure theorists to observers to experimentalists. The work will also impact undergraduate education and the general public.

Particular attention is paid to the unification of quantum theory and general relativity, two cornerstones of 20th century physics. This unification, on one hand, seems to involve a beautiful mathematical structure hidden in its underlying theoretical framework. Understanding the underlying new hidden symmetries will enhance our understanding of how the fundamental physical laws are in action. On the other hand, it requires modifications of the geometry, that we have been familiar with in Einstein's theory of gravitation, at very small distances. We begin to attack the problems of how spacetime fabrics give rise to the observed Universe, of what is the origin of the mysterious dark energy that drives our Universe to an accelerated expansion etc. These modifications, if theoretically identified and observationally verified, will greatly change our world picture in a profound way. All these should help us to understand better the recent astrophysical and cosmological observations with high precision, that have begun to provide us detailed information about the origin of our Cosmos, its past, its present and its future as well."

But the Standard Model is incomplete and we know there is important physics that lies beyond it. What is the evidence? As an example, astronomical observations indicate that the known particles of the Standard Model make up only 1/6 of the total matter in the Universe. The remainder is called ""Dark Matter"" because we don't see it directly. A number of experiments are underway or in the planning stage to look for the Dark Matter, which might be one type of particle or possibly many or perhaps something else entirely. One hypothesized Dark Matter particle is called the Dark Photon (labeled the A') and it is expected to interact with the photon of the Standard Model (known to most of us as a gamma ray).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This EArly concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) supports preliminary studies by a Cornell group led by Professor Peter Wittich to assess the technical feasibility, optimal design, physics reach, and approximate cost of a ""high risk-high payoff"" dark photon (A') search experiment at the Cornell Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory. The intended goal is to produce the A' in the reaction: (e+) + (e-) -> photon + A'. A positron (e+) beam is to be extracted from the synchrotron and directed onto a liquid hydrogen target that will provide the source of target electrons (which are constituents within the hydrogen atoms). The outgoing photon is detected in a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and the A' itself is not detected directly, but rather is ""observed"" via its potential signature in the measured missing mass distribution.<br/><br/>The strategy of this dark photon search will differ from existing and planned experiments in several respects: (a) the dark photon is identified by a missing-mass technique, so the search does not depend on a specific decay mode, as most competing experiments do; (b) there is no assumption about dark photon lifetime, as is built into many experiments that use long beam dumps or electron-positron vertexing; and (c) there is no requirement that the dark photon decay at all. The only critical assumption needed for this search is that the dark photon should interact with ordinary photons.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses two of the science drivers of the recently released Report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (called P5): Dark Matter and the Search for New Particles and Interactions. The unique facility provided by the Cornell storage ring's positron beam would allow this group to probe a new regime in Dark Matter physics, and also to possibly help explain the so-called ""g-2 anomaly"", a potentially related and highly interesting topic of current experimental research. Searching for this kind of physics beyond the Standard Model confronts fundamental symmetries, the nature of mass, the dimensionality of space, and the cosmological origins of our universe.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The proposal includes training of undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research techniques associated with this EAGER project. Additionally the principal investigators on the proposal all contribute to an extensive program of outreach at Cornell: to local K-12 schools, including both in-school programs and out-of-school workshops for teachers, educators, and high school students; to the general public; and to undergraduates."
0.320664,"9704135 Thurston This project is a multi-pronged investigation into low-dimensional geometry and topology with the central long-range goal of supporting and establishing the Geometrization Conjecture, namely, that every 3-dimensional manifold has a canonical decomposition into pieces with locally homogeneous Riemannian metrics. The first of these prongs is an investigation, partially aided by computer, of geometric Dehn filling spaces for 3-manifolds. Geometric Dehn fillings interpolate between manifolds with distinct topology. A suitable variation of this idea has the potential to connect all possible 3-manifolds and equip them with geometric decompositions. The second prong is an investigation of the geometry of taut foliations and essential laminations and their relationships to hyperbolic structures and other geometric structures. This approach has the promise to give a common generalization of the canonical decompositions of surface homeomorphisms developed by Thurston in 1976, and the geometrization of Haken manifolds developed by Thurston in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Additional prongs of this project involve contact structures, confoliations, and geometric group theory. In addition, the project will explore connections of low-dimensional geometry and topology to biology, particularly genetics. Low-dimensional geometry and topology is a beautiful area of mathematics that has undergone tremendous growth and transformation over the last two decades. Paralleling this internal development of the subject, lagging slightly behind, has been the external development of new connections and strengthened connections to other areas of mathematics and of science. Some of these connections are direct, like the cosmological issue of the shape of our universe or the more down-to-earth issue of the shapes of crystals. Other connections are indirect, to diverse topics such as databases, group theory, genetics, or computational chemistry. Any topic tha t can be formulated in a quantitative way can be studied with geometric methods (alongside the more prevalent symbolic, algebraic and analytic methods), so that in any particular case, the powerful discoveries and tools of low-dimensional geometry and topology have a reasonable chance to have a direct bearing. The aim of this project is further development of the tools of low-dimensional geometry and topology to make them more portable, more powerful and more universal. ***"
0.005,"This award will provide partial support to enable junior scientists to attend the upcoming meeting entitled, ""Hot Quarks 2010: A Workshop on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions for Young Scientists,"" to be held La Londe Les Maures, France, June 21-26, 2010. <br/><br/>The main topic of the workshop is the physics of strongly interacting nuclear matter at extreme energy densities. Quantum Chromo-Dynamics, the theory describing the forces acting within atomic nuclei, predicts that at sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a transition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP) - a transition which, according to our cosmological models, took place in the early universe about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang. <br/><br/>Already the programs at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) have produced evidence for the onset of new phenomena. The research in this field is now successfully continuing at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL while the next phase, to take place at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is under preparation. There are around 2000 physicists worldwide working in the field: a very active and lively, expanding community. In such a context, good communication and networking, especially among the young and productive members in the field, are vital. <br/><br/>The aim of this particular workshop is to enhance the direct exchange of scientific information among the younger members of the community (graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty), both from the experiment and theory. Participation in the workshop will be by invitation only - in order to strengthen the emphasis on younger members of the community, participation will be restricted to people who have obtained their Ph.D. within the past 12 years. <br/><br/>This particular approach makes the workshop unique among the various workshops and conferences in the field. For young scientists it represents an opportunity for exchange and exposure that that they would not have in one of the major big conferences. It will help to stimulate the next generation of the field and strengthen their sense of community."
0.095898,"AST-1010033/1009908<br/>Primack/Klypin<br/><br/>The majority of the stellar mass in the Universe lies in galactic spheroids, which also host supermassive black holes (SMBH). The origin of these key structures can be clarified through the interplay of new multi-wavelength survey observations and improved theory, essential for guiding and interpreting the observations. This research focuses on the growth of cosmic structure and on the two opposing effects of early, efficient star formation, and the quenching of this process in massive dark-matter halos, which together govern the formation of blue and red galaxies. This project should discriminate between galaxy spheroid buildup by cold gas inflows and disk instabilities and the alternative of major and minor mergers. The work should also identify the roles of nuclear activity versus virial shock heating in halos above a threshold mass, distinguish satellite from central quenching, and understand the cross-talk between the shutdown of star formation and the development of spheroidal stellar components and SMBHs. Detailed models of early-type galaxy formation will be compared with observations of mergers and other processes out to high redshifts, and also of nearby galaxies whose properties can be studied in detail. The work is supported by a large program of recently completed and planned follow-on computer simulations, using the most up-to-date cosmological parameters and having high mass and spatial resolution. Additional high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations will clarify galaxy formation processes and permit the calculation of kinematics, spectra and images, including dust scattering and absorption. It is crucial that simulations are 'observed' in ways that accurately mimic observations of real galaxies.<br/><br/>The team will involve students from underrepresented groups in astrophysical theory research, including the ability to understand the implications of the latest observations. This work pushes the computational envelope, and all codes and outputs will be available to the astrophysical community. Planned computer visualizations will help to understand the simulations while simultaneously making the results accessible to other researchers and to the public."
0.282341,"AST 98-02994 Mathews The PI is studying the nature and evolution of hot gas in elliptical galaxies. In recent years the quality of extragalactic x-ray observations has been steadily increasing and is expected to undergo another unprecedented multiplication in sensitivity and precision with the launching of the AXAF satellite next year. The spatial scale of AXAF are ideally suited for observations of hot gas in ellipticals. Ellipticals are not only the brightest x-ray galaxies, they also create enormous displays of radio emission and harbor massive black holes in their centers. Most massive ellipticals and their component stars are thought to be very old, formed by the merging of young galaxies in the early history of the universe. The PI has found evidence that most of the hot interstellar gas in bright ellipticals is also very old and is circumgalactic, occupying the outermost regions of the dark halos far beyond most of the galactic stars. The program begins with one dimensional numerical gas dynamic studies seeking a self consistent origin of the very old, very hot circumgalactic gas. Evidently, the circumgalactic gas first accumulated in the same cosmological inflow that formed the young elliptical. This gas may also be heated and enriched with heavy elements by supernovae of massive first generation stars. The effects of galactic rotation, tidal exchange of hot gas between galaxies, etc. will be added as the project progresses. These additions involve two or three spatial dimensions. ***"
0.324207,"Dr. Johnston and her team investigate the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies, the most common type of galaxies in our local universe, and the formation of the Milky Way galaxy through detailed hydrodynamic and N-body simulations. The observed chemical composition of stars and their distribution today together with simulations is used to learn about ancient accretion events in the stellar halo, and to recover the properties of progenitor objects (e.g. dwarf galaxies and star clusters) that contributed to our galaxy's formation. The research aims to reconstruct the galaxy's past through comparing simulations to the observed distribution of the abundances of the chemical elements in large samples of stellar populations in all components of our Galaxy, which will become available from ongoing and planned surveys (e.g. with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the HERMES spectrometer on the Anglo-Australian telescope). The chemo-dynamical formation models of the Milky Way's halo that are produced here also provide guidance on the interpretation of large data sets from stellar surveys. The models include physics on star formation, feedback and mixing, and take into account the recurrent cycle of star formation and the chemical enrichment of new star-forming regions through ejecta from dying stars. The predicted abundance distributions of the chemical elements in different stellar populations might be detected in the spectroscopic surveys of stars. The plans for the semi-analytic chemo-dynamic models include the development of multi-zoned descriptions of the galaxy with collisionless stellar orbits allowing for star formation and enrichment of gas in chemical elements. In order to derive a more complete picture about the formation and evolution of the Galactic halo, results are combined from the semi-analytic chemo-dynamical models of galaxies, the fully self-consistent cosmological N-body and hydrodynamic simulations; and the statistical analyses of structures in high dimensional spaces. The self-consistent simulations will be used to refine the descriptions of internal baryonic physics and external environmental influences that are implemented in the simpler chemo-dynamical models. This research program provides research topics for two graduate students."
0.14778,"Geometric topology was once a fringe topic, well studied in graduate schools but almost unknown in mainstream culture. Happily, in recent years public interest has increased. The key to effectively presenting geometric topology to a broad audience is to keep in mind that explanations using words alone are sure to fail. Explanations using pictures will convey a vague sense of the intended meaning. But to deeply understand the topology of a multi-connected space, the learner must experience the space for him or herself. One of the P.I.'s missions in life --- and the subject of the present project --- is to provide computer software that enables children and other non-specialists to experience 2-manifolds, 3-manifolds, and other structures directly. For example, the P.I.'s existing Torus Games have already proved effective with students from fifth grade on up, leading them to the mind-stretching concept of multiconnected spaces (specifically, the flat 2-torus and the flat Klein bottle). The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include spherical and hyperbolic 2-manifolds as well as 3-manifolds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While mathematicians' and physicists' understanding of space has made tremendous progress, the general public's understanding still lags behind. Part of the reason is that, while the modern concept of space is not inherently difficult to understand, it is extremely difficult to explain in words. Explanations with pictures work a little better, but in practice they too usually prove inadequate. The only truly effective way for a student (or nonspecialist adult) to fully grasp a new concept of space is for the student to experience the new space for him or herself. The P.I.'s existing Torus Games software lets students develop a gut-level understanding of spaces that are finite yet have no boundaries; this software is widely used in middle and high schools and is effective with students from fifth grade on up. The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include curved spaces as well as flat ones, and 3-dimensional spaces as well as ""toy"" 2-dimensional ones. Cosmologists are currently investigating the hypothesis that the real universe might be finite, but no matter whether that hypothesis is ultimately accepted or rejected, spaces of all sorts (flat and curved, finite and infinite, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) play a pervasive role throughout physics and mathematics, and merit a broader understanding in our culture as a whole."

The DOT system, a product of the paradigm shift from large-scale applications running on large parallel systems at single sites to those running on distributed systems, has come about by the availability of high-speed optical networks (E.g., Starlight, TeraGrid 40 Gb/s network, the PacificRail 10 Gb/s network). This shift necessitates techniques that allow applications to efficiently utilize distributed systems. In contrast to parallel systems, these systems must exploit two characteristics:<br/>Heterogeneity of resources (processors and networks) and <br/>Dynamic changes in performance of shared resources, especially wide area networks. <br/>The system, consisting of Linux clusters at six geographically different sites interconnected via two existing research DWDM networks, I-WIRE and OMNInet, involves the following sites: Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA), Northwester University Chicago Campus (NU-C), Northwestern University Evanston Campus (NU-E), and the University of Chicago (UC). DOT will facilitate the following research activities in the area of distributed applications:<br/>Dynamic Load Balancing (Taylor)<br/>Performance Monitoring and Prediction (Dinda, Sun, Taylor)<br/>Data Management (Choudhary, Foster)<br/>The first activity develops techniques utilizing network performance predictions that take into consideration the heterogeneity of the processors and networks of distributed systems to dynamically balance the load during execution. The second extends performance monitoring, modeling and prediction techniques that have been focused on parallel systems and broadband network to distributed systems with optical networks and different topologies. The last develops techniques that manage the distributed data such that the actual data location is transparent and the data is accessed efficiently. These research activities are driven by three applications that have been parallelized using MPI, such that the applications can be easily ported to DOT:<br/>ENZO, an adaptive cosmological application,<br/>Cactus, an open framework used to solve Einstein's equations, and<br/>AudioVoice, a virtualized distributed audio application with physical simulations that have real-time deadlines and varying computational demands.<br/>Each application presents challenges, which include adaptivity, flexible framework, and simulations with real-time deadlines."

0.149,"The properties of galaxies at distances of many billions of light years are to be investigated. Such galaxies are seen as they were at earlier stages of evolution and may reveal evolutionary effects. Moreover, the curvature of the universe expands the apparent sizes of galaxy images to a detectable degree if the distance is great enough. Progress in this field has been difficult because evolutionary, selection, and cosmological effects may be similar in appearance, and the accidental measurement errors of such faint sources may be large. The existence of large-scale structure in the universe provides a rich new field for study, but complicates the definition of statistically fair samples. The studies will feature the ultimate use of all practically accessible information for complete samples of distant galaxies, including the morphology and the internal kinematics. The methodology will be explored first by making observations of nearby galaxies. One telescope will be instrumented with an array detector sensitive to near-infrared light, and another telescope will be instrumented with an optical spectrograph. The observations, carried out with large telescopes to observe distant galaxies, will involve the use of the same infrared array detector for the purpose of making precise photometric measurements. An ongoing very faint redshift survey will be expanded to map out large-scale structure in the universe at the greatest accessible distances."
0.190586,"Dr Dodelson will focus on two issues central to understanding dark matter and dark energy: selection bias in measurements of weak gravitational lensing, and detecting the photons produced as dark matter particles annihilate. Galaxy surveys can include only objects above a given size and apparent brightness. When light from a background galaxy passes close to a dense region on its way to us, its light is bent ('lensed') so that it appears brighter and larger than otherwise. This bias introduces an illusory concentration of faint distant galaxies in the same parts of the sky as nearby concentrations of matter. A preliminary calculation shows that selection bias could change some measured quantities by as much as 10%. Dr Dodelson will undertake more detailed calculations, including an analysis of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations prepared for the Dark Energy Survey, and studies of how galaxy images are distinguished from those of stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. His aim is to understand how selection bias is likely to affect future large surveys to measure dark energy with weak lensing, and to develop analysis methods that minimize it. Current ideas about the particles making up the dark matter predict that they should have finite lifetimes, so that gamma ray telescopes such as Fermi would detect thousands of photons produced when dark matter particles annihilate. However, the 'background' of gamma rays from our own Milky Way, and from the active nuclei of galaxies, is far brighter. Dr Dodelson will explore methods to extract the dark matter signal from the background.<br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by participating in the research. Dr Dodelson plays a significant role in large collaborations including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the SuperNova Acceleration Probe, which aim at constraining the fundamental physics that gives rise to the dark energy."
0.0984,"This proposal requests support for a single investigator to continue work on outstanding problems in numerical general relativity.

0.873868,"Native American tribal governments and public educators in UT, AZ and NM have developed a new creative and accelerated means to propel forward a broad spectrum of much-needed Information Technology (IT) education and training. Their goal is to benefit adult citizenry and K-16 student populations to meet escalating college preparatory and regional/tribal workforce demands for 21st century digital job-ready IT skills. Utah Valley University (UVU), led by a team of experienced student success researchers, mentors and Native American K-12 educational specialists, have joined with global IT industry certification and training leaders to create an innovative, research-based cyber learning environment capable of realistically meeting the specific educational challenges faced by the traditionally underserved Native American communities and individuals with a 2 year integrated research and leaning project. The Native American Regional IT Industry Workforce Development Project (NA-CIT) builds upon best practices and lessons learned from a previous 2008-10 CI-TEAM demonstration project in order to accomplish its major objectives. This multi-state program, managed across institutions and a broad range of IT disciplines, deploys a synergized, culturally-relevant online delivery (Web 2.0) methodology coupled with stringent process assessment and mentored support mechanisms to maximize participant learning\success rates and outcomes. <br/><br/>A classroom and CI (hardware/software) were previously in place at the three primary training hubs: Central/Southeast Utah, Holbrook, AZ and Window Rock/Ft. Defiance on the Navajo Nation. Accomplishment of the objectives of this project portends to have far- reaching effect toward making cyber-technology more accessible to the Native American youth and young adults (age 12-50) and in opening doors for them to contribute directly to society as scientists, engineers, educators, and community leaders. NA-CIT is training between 400-500 participants over a 24 month project period. <br/><br/>The proposed demonstration project is: (1) Organizing and implementing a synergistic CI enabled instructional delivery support system (high-tech) with local counselors, mentors and teachers (high-touch) and students at 3 regional locations both via the internet and within technology-assisted classroom, teacher-led and peer-mentor supported environments, and (2) Assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the above described synergistic approach in bringing the participants to a high level average validated competency within a broad spectrum of workplace ready skill-sets (from basic computer fundamentals to higher orders of competency in web-design, network administration/support and programming e.g. - MS.Net and Linux.Net). All programs are implemented with a view to extending a similar approach to possible future full degree level programs in the IT field, and to making this comprehensive learning system scalable and replicable to other Indigenous educational environments. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This implementation project will provide a model for the scientific, engineering, and technology education of many indigenous, rural, and other minority populations throughout the world that do not have easy access to learning in these fields. Because all of the instruction and proposed coursework has a sound integrated design, a positive experience with this select population will have broad implications for similarly deployed online and/or mentored classroom IT educational environments. The probability of the success of this project is enhanced by the groundwork and physical cyber-infrastructure work that is already in place and by the cooperative efforts with companies and educational experts who have already accomplished a great deal in the technical education of the students within this demographic. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is not so much in the development of the individual components as it is in the combining of all the components to provide an immersive learning environment with learning activities, student tracking, hands-on mentoring and assessment practices that will engages and motivates the students in the course to reach a high level of competency in the subject matter area at the completion of the coursework.

The team will first identify where a dwarf galaxy forms within a large-scale cosmological simulation, and then re-run that patch of the simulation at much higher resolution with the hydrodynamic code ENZO. This code, largely developed by co-investigator Bryan, provides a higher-fidelity treatment of interstellar gas dynamics and mixing than competing methods. The group will include a new and computationally efficient method to calculate the gas cooling caused by elements with atomic numbers up to Z=30. At its highest resolution, the ENZO code will follow gas dynamics on a scale of 3-4 light years, and can include enough stellar particles to follow all individual stars with at least half the Sun's mass. Dwarf galaxies are normally found close to more luminous galaxies, which can affect their formation and evolution; the team will use their simulations to examine these processes.<br/><br/>A graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow will be trained by their involvement in the research. Dr. Johnston and her co-investigators will produce visualizations from this project, to be shown to the public at the American Museum of Natural History, where Dr. Mac Low is a tenured curator. Dr. Johnston also chairs the Vice Provost's Taskforce for Diversity in Science and Engineering at Columbia, and is active in outreach to schoolgirls."
0.15,"This Collaborative Research is proposed by Klaus Kirsten, BaylorUniversity, and Paul Loya, Binghamton University. Casimir effect is a term used for quantum effects resulting from the finite extension of systems. The continuing miniaturization of technical devices makes this effect increasingly more important; e.g. in microelectromechanical systems it is responsible for up to 10% of the forces encountered. Also on cosmological scales this effect is relevant to the dark energy and to the stabilization of extra dimensions of the universe. However, presently not even the origin of the sign of the Casimir energy is well understood. In addition, the change of the Casimir energy is largely unknown when the shape of small objects and their material properties are altered. The goal of the present proposal is to considerably improve this situation by employing two completely different strategies. 1.) For highly symmetric situations, e.g. spheres, cubes and tori, the Casimir energy is well understood. Using contour integral methods this pool will be significantly increased to include configurations related to any separable coordinate system. 2.) At present, no practicable technique is known to find the change of the Casimir energy when the geometry of objects or their material properties are changed. This proposal entails a completely new approach. Analytical surgery, a geometric analysis method designed to analyze changes in spectral quantities, will be newly employed in the field of the Casimir effect. <br/>Broader Impacts. The deeper understanding of the Casimir effect is necessary <br/>for the optimal design of microelectromechanical devices. Furthermore this project will involve the collaboration of undergraduate and graduate students from various backgrounds and different departments. The techniques that the PIs will use to study the Casimir effect are accessible to advanced undergraduate students with a complex analysis background. An undergraduate text book and class on complex analysis, path integrals, and zeta regularized determinants will be developed by the PIs within the next two years. The newly established mathematical physics seminar at Baylor University started by Kirsten will serve to communicate results obtained under this grant to attract Baylor graduate students. Loya as the adviser of the Undergraduate Math Club at SUNY Binghamton will inform those students. This project will serve as a springboard to attract graduate students to this field of research to both involved universities. Finally, coming from the areas of mathematical physics (Kirsten) and analysis (Loya), the collaboration of the PIs in this project is multidisciplinary and will be a seed for new ideas combining physics and analysis."
0.0712,"9626780 Adams Hyperbolic 3-manifold theory has had a tremendous impact on the field of low dimensional topology. Outstanding conjectures have fallen, one after the other, with the application of hyperbolic techniques. There has been a shift in the entire approach to low dimensional topology, as researchers now use rigid geometric arguments to prove topological theorems. The investigators intend to continue their research, both individually and jointly, on the theory and computation of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Through a set of projects, many relying heavily on their ability to compute examples on the computer, the researchers plan to further the understanding of the connections between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the invariants that come out of hyperbolic 3-manifold theory, and the traditional topological invariants in 3-manifold theory. A sphere, a torus and a 2-holed torus are examples of topologically distinct 2-dimensional surfaces. For about 100 years mathematicians have known that the only possible (finite) surfaces are the n-holed tori and a corresponding family of nonorientable surfaces (e.g., the nonorientable surface corresponding to a 1-holed torus is a Klein bottle). In contrast, the topological possibilities for a 3-dimensional space are vastly richer. The beautiful relationships among the possible 3-dimensional spaces have been greatly clarified since 1978, when William Thurston discovered that the best way to understand the topology of the spaces was to give them shapes of constant curvature. The present project continues to explore the relationships between the curvature and the topology. Because the shapes can be computed by hand only in a very few cases, the project also continues to develop and support computer software for creating the spaces and studying their properties. This NSF funded software is freely available, and it is used not only by mathematicians, but also by cosmologists seeking to model the shape of the real universe, and by physicists modelling the behavior of various dynamical systems. ***"

0.144574,"Abstract-DMS-0806016<br/><br/>This proposal is to study manifolds with lower point-wise or integral Ricci curvature bounds. Recent development shows the extraordinary power of Ricci flow. It thus deserves studies from various viewpoints. <br/>The PI will study Ricci flow via comparison geometry. Many geometric problems lead to integral curvatures; for example, the isospectral problems, geometric variational problems and extremal metrics, and Chern-Weil's formula for characteristic numbers. Thus, integral curvature bounds can be viewed as an optimal curvature assumption. The fundamental group is the most basic topological information. The PI will study the structures of the fundamental groups for manifolds with lower integral Ricci curvature bound. Its understanding will greatly advance the understanding of the effect of curvature bounds on the global topology of Riemannian manifolds.<br/><br/><br/>Ricci curvature is a fundamental concept in geometry as well as Einstein's general relativity. Einstein manifolds are important both in mathematics and physics. They are good candidates for canonical metrics on general Riemannian manifolds and they are the vacuum solutions of Einstein's field equation (with cosmological constant) in general relativity. <br/>General relativity is the study of gravity, the one fundamental force that should play a crucial role in understanding our universe. The proposed activities would have impact on all these directions."

One knows such randomness is necessary for consistency, since the known unpredictability of matter (for example, the quantum jumps which occur within atoms) must necessarily give rise to a corresponding unpredictability in the gravitational fields produced by the matter. When a theory of quantum gravity is found one may expect to understand what happens to objects which fall into black holes, and to understand what made the cosmological ""big bang"" take the form that it did. The approach Prof. Sorkin will follow is based on the hypothesis that spacetime has an ""atomic"" structure, being what technically is called a causal set. At the current stage of development of this theory a central question in understanding how the spacetime ""atoms"" interact with each other, is that of l earning which sort of interaction can avoid producing the impression of action at a distance (which would conflict with established physical laws). Prof. Sorkin will study this question using computer simulations of fields like the electromagnetic field propagating on a causal set. Progress in this effort will be a significant step toward a full formulation of causal set dynamics using Feynman's sum over histories method. It might also provide a novel method which one could apply to computer simulations of other problems of physical importance, such as predicting the masses of e lementary particles like the proton. ***"
0.057,"Models of extragalactic radio jets will be constructed using a variety of numerical approaches. An essentially three-dimensional boundary-following code will be used to continue to investigate the formation and evolution of radio jets. In particular, the bending of jets by ram pressure as the central galactic source moves through an external medium, the growth of non-axisymmetric instabilities, and the effects of a precessing source of jet fluid, will all be studied. Recently developed analytic models of jet propagation from a galactic halo across a pressure-matched interface into an extremely hot intergalactic medium will be developed further. Preliminary calculations using this idea seem to provide good explanations for both the current average size of strong radio sources and the fact the such sources were significantly samller at earlier cosmological epochs. Numerical models of this situation will be developed using both the three-dimensional boundary following code and a full two-dimensional hydrodynamics code and more detailed comparisons with statistical data will be made. Analytic models for jet instabilities will be applied to Very Large Array (VLA) radio maps of a particularly interesting radio source with a single, oscillatory jet feeding into a diffuse lobe. A general model for the continuum electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei, based on coherent plasma processes, will be further developed and compared with observations."
0.15,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Surjeet Rajendran at the University of California, Berkeley. Physical laws often lead to new particles through which their effects are manifested on the natural world. For example, we experience the electric force because of the existence of particles like the electron and the proton that carry electric charge, with the force between them carried by the photon. Searches for particles is thus a fruitful way to discover new fundamental forces. It is important to search for such fundamental forces since they have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the origins of the laws of nature. They may also potentially enable us to interact with the natural world in dramatically new ways, potentially permitting advances as remarkable as the effects of electromagnetism on our daily lives. Many models of fundamental physics predict the existence of particles that have very small masses and also have very weak interactions with our world. In some cases, these particles can also be the dark matter of the universe. Their weak interactions can be overcome either with large systems or through precision technology. This project develops methods that use large astrophysical objects such as millisecond pulsars as well as precision laboratory techniques to significantly expand our reach into the parameter space of such particles.<br/><br/>Professor Rajendran will develop new experimental approaches to detect ultra-light particles that interact very weakly with the standard model such as axions and dark photons. Such particles naturally emerge in many frameworks of physics beyond the standard model, and may even be the dark matter of the universe. The methods developed by Professor Rajendran include the use of the existence of the super-radiant instability of rotating systems to argue that the existence of certain kinds of light particles would cause the rapid spin-down of millisecond pulsars. Observations of such pulsars can therefore constrain these particles. Professor Rajendran will point out qualitatively new effects of dark photons emerging from their longitudinal modes. These effects have been overlooked in the literature and by incorporating them, he will show how existing experiments can parametrically extend their reach into the parameter space of such models. These gains also extend to the case where such dark photons constitute the dark matter of the Universe and he will invent techniques tailored to detect such dark matter. Professor Rajendran will also show how current experimental methodologies that have been developed to search for fundamental sources of CPT violation or a cosmologically preferred direction can also be used to search for certain kinds of light dark matter. The dark matter signal can be qualitatively different from the signals typically expected in these experiments and may permit ways to overcome the systematic limitations of such experiments. With the increasing costs of collider experiments, the future of particle physics may lie as much in non-collider experiments that can probe such hidden sectors that lie far in the ultra-violet."
0.302265,"A great mystery of the Universe is how the first stars and galaxies formed. Astrophysicists can virtually look back in time by examining some of the most distant galaxies in the Universe, whose light has taken billions of years to reach Earth. Detailed, careful study of these very distant galaxies is critical to understanding how the first stars and galaxies formed. Unfortunately, it is very challenging to identify these galaxies. This project aims to use a new technique that exploits gravitational lensing by foreground clusters of galaxies that magnify these distant galaxies, making them easier to detect.<br/><br/>The principal investigators' (PIs') new theoretical framework for analyzing multiple-lensing planes reveals that there are mass distributions consisting of multiple structures along the line-of-sight and large integrated masses that produce a many-fold increase in the number of lensed z > ~7 sources, particularly at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. These beams are effective because they create significant magnification over a large area, or high etendue. Cosmological simulations suggest that they are rare but identifiable by choosing lines-of-sight with the highest integrated luminosities of galaxies that trace the densest structures, i.e., luminous red galaxies. The PIs have now identified 40 such lines-of-sight in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Spectroscopy of the first seven confirms that they are likely the most powerful gravitational lens telescopes in the sky. This project will use a comprehensive observational and theoretical program to enable highly efficient ground- and space-based follow-up surveys for lensed z ~ 7 to 10 sources. Using galaxy spectroscopy and lensed arc imaging to constrain each line-of-sight mass distribution, coupled with theoretical modeling to generate a precise lensing magnification map, the PIs will place the first limits on the faint end luminosity evolution of the most distant galaxies.<br/><br/>This work will advance the training of graduate students at The University of Arizona and Rutgers University by allowing them to work with senior personnel on forefront observational analyses and theoretical modeling. Co-PI Zabludoff is involved in The University of Arizona's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) chapter, where she discusses her research in their workshops for teenage girls.

Co-PI Keeton is the Faculty Director of the Aresty Research Center for Undergraduates at Rutgers, a privately-endowed center that supports approximately 200 student research projects each year. This project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education via the co-PI's partnership, advance the teaching of faculty and the training and learning of students, broaden the dissemination of knowledge through the public release of the lens modeling software, and may increase the participation of underrepresented women and Native Americans through outreach."
0.00507,"When the first stars in the history of the universe were formed, they began to emit light, known as photons. It is believed that this light can be observed as a faint glow that is seen in every direction in the sky using infrared telescopes. Measuring this faint glow, referred to as the Cosmic Near-Infrared Background (NIRB), can be thought of as indirectly looking at the first sources of light. Professor Kyung-jin Ahn at Chosun University in Gwangju, South Korea, has recently run a high-resolution cosmological simulation that captures the formation of the first sources of light. Using these simulations, the connections between the properties of the first sources and their surroundings and the observed NIRB will be made. This research will study the correlation between the first sources of light and the NIRB. In studying this correlation, a better understanding about the history of the universe can be gained. Studying the universe will provide tests for physics that cannot be studied through experimentation on Earth, thereby leading to further advancements in human knowledge and technological developments.<br/><br/>With this dataset, the resulting spectrum will be calculated, which can then be compared with the actual observations. Furthermore, because certain factors, such as star formation rates, the number of photons produced, and the initial mass function, are known in advance, precisely how these parameters manifest themselves in the NIRB can be understood. Putting a tighter limit on these parameters will also lead to a better understanding of a different astrophysical event, Cosmic Reionization, when the universe transformed from being filled with neutral hydrogen to a sea of ionized plasma.

0.08,"This CAREER award funds the research activities of Professor Joshua Ruderman at New York University.<br/><br/>Significant evidence suggests that most of the matter in our Universe is composed of an unknown source known as ""dark matter"". Experiments conducted over the next few years will make dramatic progress testing the extent to which dark matter is a particle that interacts with ordinary matter. Meanwhile, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is exploring the highest energies ever probed. The LHC recently discovered a remarkable new particle, the Higgs boson, and is now studying the properties of this new particle. The LHC may also discover additional new particles as well. Against this backdrop, Professor Ruderman will pursue an original program of research and education concentrating on the origins of dark matter and the Higgs. He will study the exciting possibility that there exist new hidden sectors of particles which have thus far escaped experimental detection because they are very weakly interacting with ordinary particles. He will explore new models in which dark matter is a hidden-sector particle, or in which the Higgs boson interacts with hidden-sector particles. In order to help in spreading physics to a broad audience, Professor Ruderman will also establish a competitive ""Physics in Media Travel Award"". He will partner with NYU's Tisch School of the Arts to send film students to visit physics experiments that will appear in their movies. He will also partner with NYU's Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program (SHERP) to send science journalism students to visit physics experiments which will be featured in their stories. Resulting films will be screened at local high schools, and resulting stories will be disseminated online in various journalism venues.<br/><br/>More specifically, Professor Ruderman will explore novel cosmologies for hidden-sector dark matter in which the annihilation rate is exponentially suppressed, predicting dark matter exponentially lighter than the TeV scale. This exponential suppression occurs when dark matter annihilates into heavier states, or is in equilibrium with heavier particles that are annihilating. Professor Ruderman will develop new observational tests for light dark matter, including searches for UV and soft X-ray photons emitted by dark-matter decays or annihilations. Professor Ruderman will also explore the interplay of hidden sectors with Higgs physics. He will develop novel models with a fine-tuned Higgs mass and light hidden-sector scalars that interact with the Higgs. He will also explore supersymmetric models with a natural Higgs mass in which stops are light and abundantly produced at the LHC but nevertheless hidden behind top-quark backgrounds."
0.653,"Research in theoretical physics will focus on questions in elementary particle physics and astrophysics. The physical, astrophysical, and cosmological consequences of theories in which space has more than three<br/>dimensions will be explored. Ramifications of ""duality relations"" demonstrating that seemingly different string theories are actually different forms of the same theory will be studied. Small effects that will test our present understanding of the forces between the elementary particles and possibly signal the presence of new physics beyond our present understanding will be theoretically analyzed. The possibility that space has more than three dimensions is extremely interesting, and the exploration of its consequences is very important. String theory is the leading candidate for a theory that unifies our understanding of all the basic forces of nature, so further progress in this theory is important as well. Finally, small effects have been a fruitful testing ground for our understanding of physics in the recent past, so new analyses of such effects is very timely."
0.56,"This award funds the research activities of Professors Christopher Carone, Joshua Erlich, and Marc Sher at the College of William and Mary. <br/><br/>The Standard Model of particle physics provides a consistent description of all known elementary particles and their interactions. However, there are many features of the theory that remain mysterious and suggest that the Standard Model is incomplete: How must the theory be modified to explain the observed pattern of elementary particle masses? How must the theory be extended to explain the observational evidence for the existence of dark matter? Is the relatively small mass of the recently discovered Higgs boson hinting at a more complicated spectrum of Higgs-sector particles yet to be discovered? The intellectual merit of the work proposed by Professors Carone, Erlich and Sher stems from its focus on addressing these and other fundamental issues, which will help to advance our understanding of the physics of the elementary particles. With the restart of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and with new results from dark matter detectors imminent, one expects exciting new discoveries in the near future, and the PIs' research will be well timed to explore the results from these experiments. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. The Broader Impact of this work is that it furthers the education of undergraduate and PhD research students, including those from underrepresented groups, facilitates outreach to the general public, and promotes high-energy particle physics in the southeastern part of the United States.<br/><br/>As part of their specific research projects, the PIs anticipate progress along several distinct lines. On the issue of fermion masses, the PIs and their students will study model-independent bounds and cosmological consequences of pseudo-familons - particles that may be light enough to be experimentally accessible even though they are originate from new flavor physics associated with a very high energy scale. On the issue of dark matter, the PIs and their students will consider new models in which a dark sector of particles arises dynamically, such as certain supersymmetric ""moose"" models in which non-perturbative physics associated with a strongly coupled dark sector drives a messenger sector gauge coupling to very small values. On the issue of Higgs-sector physics, the PIs will study novel two-Higgs doublet models, one class that avoids flavor-changing-neutral currents via non-Abelian discrete symmetries and another class extended as in the Lee-Wick Standard Model, providing numerous predictive relations between heavy Higgs masses and couplings. They will explore the implications of these models for the LHC. In addition to these investigations, the PIs and their students will also consider other fundamental issues, for example, attempting to elucidate the appearance of black-hole horizons in gravity duals of finite-temperature theories by matching appropriate calculations in dual gauge-gravity models to perturbative finite-temperature quantum chromodynamics. Carone, Erlich and Sher will also continue activities that provide a substantial broader impact, including the supervision of undergraduate, PhD, and REU research students, participation in local events (for example, QuarkNet), and continued interaction with local and national media on particle-physics issues."
0.754824,"There is overwhelming astrophysical evidence that less than 5 percent of the universe is made from ordinary - or baryonic - matter. The rest of the cosmos appears to be constituted from ""dark matter,"" which has the gravitational properties of matter but which hardly interacts with light (25 percent), together with ""dark energy,"" which acts to repel the force of gravity.

The ethical principles that come to play with NAGPRA require increased understanding and appreciation of multiple ways of knowing by both scientists and adherents to alternative views. Hence, analyzing how scientists learn about and cope with NAGPRA targets core values and philosophies held by scientists and juxtaposes these with indigenous impressions both about the past and about what scientists do. The collegium convened to study and improve on training materials takes a practical problem and uses it to address fundamental distinctions made between scientific and alternative world-views."
0.076698,"This award is designated as a Global Venture Fund Award and is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering. The detection of gravitational waves, either on Earth or in space, will open a new window on the universe, requiring extremely sophisticated techniques in experiment and analysis, large facilities, significant manpower and extensive international collaboration. Likely sources of these waves include binary systems of black holes and neutron stars, and solar mass objects spiralling into supermassive black holes. Comparison of the observed gravitational-wave signal with theoretical predictions will enable both the estimation of key astrophysical and cosmological parameters as well as tests of Einstein's general theory of relativity. This project will contribute to the development of gravitational-wave astronomy by enabling more effective collaborations between the PIs and their students and post-docs at the University of Florida (UF) and Dr. Luc Blanchet and his group at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (IAP). The detailed comparison between two different approaches to deriving the motion of small compact bodies orbiting massive compact bodies will be extended to higher orders in the relevant approximation. These comparisons will lead to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of inspiral and merger of compact bodies. Calculations of the motion and gravitational-wave emission of binary compact bodies to high orders in the post-Newtonian approximation will be extended to alternative theories of gravity. In the UF group, Will is a leading expert in testing alternative theories and post-Newtonian theory, complementing Blanchet's expertise. We will extend a theorem by Stephen Hawking on isolated black holes in the Brans-Dicke alternative theory to the more complicated case of two black holes in a circular orbit. This will take advantage of recent work by Blanchet and Whiting in their collaboration on laws of binary black hole mechanics in general relativity.<br/><br/>This work will impact gravitational-wave observations, as the equations developed in this project will be critical in the development of data-analysis algorithms for the detectors. Education and training will be integrated into the research program. Graduate students and post-docs will have the opportunity to travel to the partner institution for extended periods of intensive collaboration. The proposed research will have a broad impact upon our understanding of the applications of General Relativity to extreme astrophysical systems, upon science education, and upon understanding and appreciation of science by the public."

Data analysis strategies for searching GW signals from a variety of astrophysical and cosmological sources with a network of detectors operating simultaneously will be formulated as part of this program. A multi-detector analysis is significant owing to the most powerful veto it levies against instrumental artifacts and the additional source properties it unravels. <br/><br/>Gravitational-wave science oriented courses and lab experiments will be included to enhance WSU's astronomy program and to develop the infrastructure required for a quick transfer of knowledge. Sophomores and seniors, numbering about 200 per year, will be trained to develop skills in a field that will soon be inundated with data, with the hope that some of them will go on to graduate programs strongly tied to GW research. Courses in GW science will be cross-listed towards a major in physics, thus expanding their impact. LIGO will be supported by this work in ushering in a new era in Physics and Astronomy where novel insights will be gained into the behavior of pulsars, supernovae and black holes, and in putting our best understanding of classical gravity, in the form of Einstein's general relativity, to a fresh set of stringent tests."
0.115952,"Property (T), which states that every isometric action of a group on Hilbert space has a fixed point, is an indispensable tool in the study of rigidity. Isometric actions on Hilbert space can be described in the language of low-dimensional cohomology with coefficients in a unitary representation. A result of Chatterji-Drutu-Haglund shows that median space actions are sufficiently rich to embody the theory of isometric actions on Hilbert space. Through this proposal, the PI will expand on recent collaborations and look at the connections between isometric Hilbert space actions and actions on median spaces via the tool of low dimensional cohomology.<br/><br/>Newton affirmed that the universe ""looks the same in every direction."" This cosmological principle leads to the conclusion that the large scale geometry of the universe must be spherical (absence of parallel lines), Euclidean (uniqueness of parallel lines), or hyperbolic (existence and non-uniqueness of parallel lines). These geometries can only be understood in the large scale since Einstein's theory of general relativity asserts that masses locally distort the space-time fabric. Understanding the study of large scale geometry and symmetry was revolutionized by Gromov's approach to group theory. A group is the collection of symmetries of an object. The PI's research is concerned with CAT(0) geometry, a mix between Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries. More specifically, she studies rigidity, which can be thought to address the questions: 1) Can a group be represented as a collection of symmetries of a certain geometric object? 2) If so, is such a representation unique? The study of rigidity is important in its own right as a mathematical phenomenon. Nevertheless, it could one day lead to a better understanding of our universe."
0.309984,"The aim of this project is to investigate the Epoch of Reionization (EOR) in the history of the universe via simulations of cosmological radiative transfer and N-body/gas dynamics. This will address frontier problems in the theory of reionization and its feedback on galaxy formation in the Cold DarkMatter model, in order to predict observable signatures. These will include predictions for the redshifted 21-cm background from the cosmic ""Dark Ages"" and the EOR, an area of great current observational interest. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and participation of individuals from underrepresented groups."
21.448911,"ABSTRACT UCSD 0910847 Norman, Michael L.<br/><br/>This project supports the acquisition, deployment and operation of a new supercomputing system suitable for data-intensive applications. The system, to be known as Flash Gordon, will be deployed by the University of California at San Diego at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and integrated into the TeraGrid. The system, which has been designed by Appro International Incorporated, with partners Intel and ScaleMP, seeks to bridge the widening latency gap between main memory and rotating disk storage in modern computing systems. It uses flash memory to provide a level of dense, affordable, low-latency storage that can be configured as either extended swap space or a very fast file system. The system will consist of very large shared virtual-memory, cache-coherent ""super-nodes"" to support a versatile set of programming paradigms. Peak performance will exceed 200 teraflops/s in double precision.<br/><br/>Flash Gordon's large addressable virtual memory, low-latency flash memory, and user-friendly programming environment will provide a step-up in capability for data-intensive applications that scale poorly on current large-scale architectures, providing a resource that will enable transformative research in many research domains. Even sequential codes will be able to address up to terabytes of fast virtual memory. <br/><br/>Examples of scientific challenges, as described in the proposal, that this resource will allow researchers to tackle, include the following. <br/><br/>De Novo Genome Assembly: Gene sequencers produce information about many small fragments of a genome. Some recent assembly algorithms use a graph-based approach, much more readily executed on a shared-memory system. Using Flash Gordon, researchers will be able to rapidly assemble complex genomes such as mammalian genomes.<br/><br/>Astronomy: Modern astronomy databases can be large; for example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is approximately six terabytes in size. Typically, the analysis algorithms that researchers use to perform complex searches for astronomical phenomena can be implemented more easily on shared-memory systems. Flash Gordon will enable researchers to load a copy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey into the flash memory associated with a super-node, greatly extending the types of analyses astronomers can make.<br/><br/>Astrophysics: Cosmological simulations produce many terabytes of output describing the simulated universe. Detailed analysis of the results of these simulations, to find features such as collapsed halos, galaxy mergers, dwarf galaxies, and galaxy clusters, often requires density-based cluster analysis that does not parallelize well. With Flash Gordon, these analyses can be accelerated by exploiting the large SMP partitions and fast flash memory.<br/><br/>Interaction Networks: Interaction networks, graphs representing the relationships between objects, are used in research in areas such as epidemiology, phylogenetics, systems biology, and population biology. These interaction networks can represent relationships between types of data stored in different databases; for example, the combination of social network databases with medical records and genomic profiles to explore questions such as genetic resistance to disease. Flash Gordon will speed analysis of large interaction networks because the databases can be stored on the solid-state disks, greatly reducing access time and permitting more complex types of analysis.<br/><br/>The project team will leverage a number of ongoing educational activities at UCSD to expand and diversify the community of users that can utilize this computational resource, including successful outreach programs for women and minorities from underrepresented groups in science and engineering. The project will also create a summer training program for undergraduates."
0.137463,"Rusin<br/>DMS-1613831<br/><br/> The problems addressed in the project involve mathematics of an interdisciplinary character. Analytical study of the nonlinear phenomena in equations describing flows of fluids is essential to areas that range from weather prediction, climate and environmental studies, turbulent and combustion (as for instance in engines) to the cosmological question of mass distribution in the universe. The aim of the project is to develop applicable mathematics theory that yields progress in understanding of fluids and that facilitates efficient computational tools. <br/><br/> The main objective of the project is the investigation of well-posedness of partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics. The primary emphasis is placed on the incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the context of large initial data. In particular, the analysis focuses on the existence and properties of solutions with axial symmetry and time-periodic solutions. The research extends to related models such as a class of active scalar equations that arises in the geophysical fluid dynamics. Here, the main aim is to investigate ill/well-posedness phenomena of nonlinear problems, where the nonlinearity is based on even or singular symbols, additionally equipped with some intrinsic anisotropy. The project concerns furthermore the problem of uniqueness of solutions to the primitive equation of the ocean. The last objective addresses a local model of the Euler equations and its analysis, in particular related to singular limits and vorticity stretching in the three-dimensional Euler equations."
0.140297,"This project will study two aspects of gravity: (1) gravitational collapse and (2) gravitational radiation. (1) When an object's gravity becomes strong enough to trap light, the object becomes a black hole. Inside the black hole the object continues to become smaller and smaller under the influence of its own gravity until it becomes a point with infinite density and infinite gravitational field called a singularity. I will work out the properties of the singularities formed in gravitational collapse, and in particular the forces felt by any observer who approaches the singularity. (2) Just as the electric currents in a radio transmitter make radio waves, so moving masses make gravity waves. And just as radio receivers react to the presence of radio waves, so there is an ongoing effort to detect gravitational waves. One interesting aspect of gravitational radiation is something called gravitational wave memory: even after the wave has passed, there is a permanent change in the gravitational wave detector. I will study the causes and properties of this gravitational wave memory.<br/><br/>It is conjectured that the singularity inside a black hole consists of two parts: a spacelike singularity at the center of the black hole and a null singularity that takes the place of the black hole's inner horizon. I will study both types of singularities using two different numerical methods. Previously, I have performed simulations of spacelike singularities; however these simulations revealed the presence of structure with a very small spatial scale (called ""spikes"") that was not resolved by the simulations. I will revisit these simulations using the technique of adaptive mesh refinement, which should serve to resolve the spikes. I will compare the results of these simulations to those of an analytic approximation to spike behavior using what are expected to be the leading terms of the field equations near the singularity. I will study null singularities using a ""double null"" formulation of the Einstein field equations. Here instead of the usual foliation of spacetime by spacelike surfaces of constant time t, one has a foliation by pairs of null surfaces of constant null coordinates u and v. The Einstein field equations and Bianchi identities then become equations for the expansion and shear of the null surfaces and the Weyl tensor. I will perform numerical simulations of these equations to see whether the Weyl tensor blows up on (what used to be) the inner horizon of the black hole. I will study gravitational wave memory from a variety of sources using a variety of methods. Memory from neutrinos will be treated using the full nonlinear Einstein-Vlasov equations. Memory in an expanding universe will be treated using cosmological perturbation theory. Memory for the vacuum case will be treated in second order perturbation theory. I will also study critical gravitational collapse using a new vacuum axixymmetric code. In addition, I will continue, using numerical methods, my studies of Einstein-Aether theory, gravitational collapse in anti de-Sitter spacetime, and charged black holes."
0.36247,"All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the Universe, but a dark matter particle has yet to be directly detected. A well-motivated possible candidate is a light axion. Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may be detected through their conversion into a narrow microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. Using this concept the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has performed a search for such axions within the mass range of a few micro-eV. Recently a smaller microwave cavity experiment was constructed called ADMX-HF (High Frequency), specifically to explore higher ranges of axion masses. ADMX-HF also serves as a test-bed for innovations in microwave cavity and amplifier technologies that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform. ADMX-HF and ADMX operate as ""one experiment, two sites"", sharing expertise, technology, and data. This award will expand the collaboration to accelerate the construction of ADMX-HF as well as dramatically expand its initial capability.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: ADMX has proven to be a technology driver as components such as the SQUID amplifiers developed for ADMX are already being used for other purposes. Innovations to be developed by ADMX-HF have similarly broad potential. Both PI and Co-PI are committed educators with long experience in involving undergraduate students in their research and engaging the public. The research funded through this award will inform additional education and outreach initiatives with which they are involved."
0.15,"A complete understanding of the history of our universe is not possible without addressing the problems of singularities in classical gravity. Singularities, such as the big bang, are the boundaries of classical space and time where the classical physics stops. These singularities signal that the underlying theory, in this case Einstein's theory of General Relativity, has reached its limit of validity. Answers to fundamental questions such as the birth of the universe thus cannot be obtained using general relativity which is based on the classical notion of space and time. It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity would reveal new physics which provides important clues on the resolution of singularities. In this research, loop quantum gravity is used to explore the fate of singularities in different spacetimes, including cosmological and black hole spacetimes. Lessons from these investigations will be important to understand the quantum nature of spacetime, the physics of the very early universe and the final stages of the gravitational collapse. <br/><br/>Research carried out in this project deals with analytical, phenomenological and numerical investigations of isotropic, anisotropic, black hole and inhomogeneous spacetimes to understand singularity resolution using techniques of loop quantum gravity. By a systematic study of quantization of these spacetimes and its relation with the effective descriptions, precise physics at the Planck scale will be extracted and phenomenological implications will be explored. This research also aims to address fundamental issues pertaining to the quantum probabilities for events, such as the quantum bounce, in a quantum universe. These investigations are expected to give valuable insights on the generic resolution of singularities in quantum gravity."
0.36,"A new paradigm for dealing with the dynamics of totally constrained theories like general relativity will continue to be developed both at a classical and quantum level. The paradigm consists in constructing discrete theories such that the continuum theory of interest arises as a well defined limit. The specific proposal for constructing the discrete theories, called ""uniform discretizations"" has several attractive features. In particular the discrete theories are free of constraints and therefore avoid many of the hard conceptual problems that complicate traditional quantum gravity, and nevertheless manage to provide a well defined limit in which one recovers the continuum theory of interest. A paradigm emerges that is analogous to that of lattice gauge theory, where discrete theories are used in a limiting procedure to define a continuum theory of interest. This approach has already been applied successfully in some situations where the space-time has some spatial dependence (i.e. more complicated than homogeneous cosmologies) but without genuine degrees of freedom, most notably providing a characterization of the complete space-time of a non-singular loop quantum gravity black hole. This NSF award will focus on applying the paradigm in situations of increasing complexity. This includes the collapse of scalar fields to form black holes and related models. It is also proposed to further other topics related to the dynamics of quantum gravity like the problem of time and the issue of measurement in quantum mechanics. This research program also aids in the creation of human resources in US physics through the training of a postdoctoral researcher and provides the possibility that the discretization techniques introduced here may have applicability in other areas of science and engineering as well."
0.216847,"Vacuum (Casimir) energy in quantum field theory is of interest in the physics community and its connections with some mathematical topics in spectral theory and asymptotics of differential operators have recently become clearer. Thus this collaboration between physicists and mathematicians is an effective approach to further progress. The investigators intend to build on the results of their previous collaboration to make progress in two areas: (1) Gravitational significance of vacuum energy: The previous work has demonstrated that vacuum energy gravitates just as does any other form of energy. For plane geometries the divergences renormalize the masses of the material bodies confining the field. This analysis will be extended to general geometries. This requires the mathematical theory of the asymptotics of (Schwartz) distributions as well as sound physics. (2) Improved calculational methods: In the presence of curved surfaces, higher-order corrections are hard to calculate in classical-path analyses of vacuum energy and eigenvalue distribution. In the presence of sharp edges or corners (other than right angles) the semiclassical methods break down quite seriously (diffraction). The project will develop and apply more fundamental and accurate analyses, known as multiple reflection or multiple scattering. Previous success in treating the forces between dielectric bodies by multiple scattering will be extended and applications to practical configurations such as noncontact gears and multilayer surfaces are being pursued. Also, the multiple-reflection expansion will be used for accurate calculation of vacuum energy density and pressure near curved surfaces and edges and corners.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project stems partly from its interdisciplinary nature. The subject not only combines physics and mathematics, but also combines topics within physics and within mathematics that are ripe for productive interaction. Vacuum energy is relevant both to new nanotechnological devices and to cosmological issues (dark energy). Mathematically, the connection between periodic-orbit theory and vacuum energy has only recently been exploited, and the implications of vacuum energy for spectral theory have barely been explored. Undergraduate and graduate student research assistants from both physics and mathematics will be recruited and their educations will be enhanced, and a diverse student population is being trained. The project will also foster future research interactions with other fields (gravitational implications, nanotechnology, quantum graphs, spectral geometry)."
0.088968,"DMS-9801304 P. Daskalopoulos The abstact follows : The major objectives of this proposal are concerned with the study of certain quasilinear or fully-nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations in connection with more complexproblems of differential geometry, including the Ricci flow and the Gauss curvature flow. These problems find physical applications in such areas as population dynamics, diffusion in porous media, and thin liquid film dynamics. One specific area which will be investigated is the regularity question in free-boundary problems arising from the degeneracy of certain non-linear parabolic equations, including the porous medium equation, the evolution p-laplacian equation and Gauss Curvature flow with flat sides. Another specific area of the main objectives concerns the study of ultra-fast diffusion parabolic equations, which have received large attention because of their relationship to differential geometry topics, such as the Ricci flow and the Yamabe flow. The solvability of the Cauchy problem for these equations, the study of the blow up profile of solutions, the nonradial structure solutions, and the uniqueness of solutions, are among the problems which will be investigated in this specific area. The still open question of the uniqueness of sign-solutions of the porous medium equation, in connection with the continuity question for a class of linear singular parabolic equations falls under the proposed major goals to be studied. The non-linear equations to be studied under this proposal form the basic concepts of many applications which deem to be important to technology and the society at large. The purification of materials, from chemicals to petroleum and even water, is often achieved by diffusion through filters. The purification filters are the porous media described in the proposal. Thin film dynamics and the Van der Waals forces operating between thin layers are described by singular quasilinear equations of ultra-fast d iffusion. The dynamics of population growth, polymer chain growth, including cross linking and high rate growth of biomolecules, are also non-linear phenomena amiable to our basic studies. The interesting problem of the expanding universe and other cosmological phenomena seem to be goverened by nonlinear dynamics, which in certain cases are applications of the more complex problems described here."
0.157005,"This award funds the research activities of Professor James Bullock at the University of California, Irvine.<br/><br/>Professor Bullock's research aims to explore the nature of dark matter using supercomputer simulations. Dark matter stands among the deepest mysteries in science. It makes up some 85% of the clustering matter in the universe, yet its fundamental nature remains unknown. The existence of dark matter provides one of the strongest pieces of evidence that our understanding of nature remains incomplete. The most popular idea at this time is that the dark matter is made of a single particle that interacts only weakly with itself (and with normal matter), but this model faces some difficulties reproducing observations on the scales of galaxies. An intriguing solution is that the dark matter is more complex, with its own set of strong self-interactions, analogous, perhaps, to the particles that make up the visible world. This award will support supercomputer simulations of galaxy formation including both standard dark matter and more complex dark matter to determine whether or not galaxy observations provide evidence that dark matter is self-interacting. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe. Moreover, the simulation codes and analysis software will be made public and Professor Bullock will mentor graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students as part of this project, providing these young people with mathematical, computational, and data-mining training that will be a valuable asset for them and their communities well past the funding period. Professor Bullock will also give public lectures on this research.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Bullock will use a suite of simulations to provide the most accurate and robust constraints yet derived on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section and to determine whether or not self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models provide a better match to data than standard cold dark matter once realistic treatments of baryons are included. The work will include 1) focused, idealized simulations of individual galaxies and merging galaxy clusters; 2) cosmological simulations; and 3) full hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation set within the SIDM framework. This work builds upon an existing and well-tested code, and will involve running models with velocity-independent, isotropic, energy-exchange cross-sections as well as models with more complex behavior in velocity-dependence and non-isotropic scattering."
0.12,"This award supports research focused on understanding and developing the theory of cosmological models containing dark matter arising as the relic of decays of other particles present in the very early universe. The theoretical framework will be developed in order to test models with dark matter from such early decays, and to critically assess how well the cold dark matter paradigm may be tested through gravitational lensing and cosmic microwave background observations. About 30% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of non-relativistic dark matter. Super-symmetry (and other theories of physics beyond the standard model) naturally predict the existence of dark matter. Two generic possibilities are cold dark matter (e.g., neutralino) and dark matter from early decays (e.g., weak-scale mass gravitino). The large scale structure in the universe developing from these two models is similar, but they may be distinguished based on observations of structure on small scales (of order megaparsec or smaller). It was previously shown by the PI that dark matter from early decays could alleviate the problems besetting cold dark matter on these small scales.<br/><br/>All the results from the above research and source codes of the gravitational lensing and CMB related software written as part of the research will be made publicly available. Additional outreach includes a plan to strengthen and expand the existing Physics road show program at UC Irvine."
0.14,"The observation of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) will be a tremendous scientific accomplishment, but the resources provided through this grant will create many other positive opportunities. Carleton College is a leader in producing future scientists. This project will provide research opportunities to students with interests in physics and statistics, and help train them to become the next generation of scientists. Carleton students are eager to participate in exciting research, and their interest in gravitational wave astronomy, and science in general, is large. The computational statistical methods developed as a consequence of this project have, and will continue to have significant influence in other scientific fields: astrophysics, chaos studies, and gravitational wave detectors in space. The project will also continue to provide material that will improve teaching at the college level; subjects that will benefit from the science covered in this project include optics, general relativity, and statistics. This project also creates opportunities for scientific outreach; high school students and high school teachers will continue to be exposed to the wonder and significance of LIGO's research, and this outreach creates much excitement for science and physics. Finally, the research work of this project promotes international scientific collaboration. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916; a century later we should actually observe gravitational waves, and consequently the scientific and educational benefit will be tremendous.<br/><br/>Events seen by LIGO will produce a wealth of astrophysical information, the extraction of which will require advanced techniques in data analysis, parameter estimation, and statistics. Detector characterization work will provide scientists with confidence in the quality of the data, and the performance of the detectors. Carleton College will continue with its significant efforts in identifying and characterizing noise in LIGO data; this information will be fed back to the interferometer operators in order to improve the detector performance. Carleton and colleagues are researching how to eliminate magnetic field noise from the Schumann resonances that is coherent in the LIGO-Virgo detector network. Carleton will use LIGO data to observe a cosmologically produced stochastic gravitational wave background. Carleton will contribute to the effort to detect long duration gravitational waves by correlating data from two detectors, and using pattern recognition techniques to look for signals.

Such resources include high-performance computaitonal clusters, data storage and archival systems, and visualization resources. This project improves connectivity between these systems internally and between these systems and the University's collaborators in the US and around the globe. Resources with improved connectivity include Nyx, a shared-tenancy high performance cluster; Flux, a University-wide shared compute cluster; and the UM 3D Visulation Lab, an interdisciplinary service facility used in part for visual exploration of large scientific data sets.<br/><br/>This project's support of improved network connectivity between these assets and the broader Internet supports a broad swath of computationally-enabled scientific explorations, including the following examples.

0.574719,"The researcher will address a major question in Astronomy, understanding the first formation of galaxies. Our most distant vision of the universe comes from radio wavelength observations. Their plan is to implement critical components of the next generation radio telescope. This telescope will observe the heating of the gas between galaxies, which happened when the first stars in galaxies formed. These first stars in the first galaxies are too distant to be seen in optical light, but can be detected in radio waves. Because these first galaxies are seen from a great distance, the radio waves are found to be shifted to much lower frequencies, making these observations very difficult. <br/><br/>The researcher will contribute to the study in two key ways: 1) investigating the effects of polarization calibration and foreground sources on power spectrum estimation and 2) developing the observational and analysis techniques to cross-correlate Epoch of Re-ionization data with other data sets. The critical goal is extracting cosmological information, and their approach is based on semi-analytic models of re-ionization galaxies.<br/><br/>The primary broader impact activity is a novel one that goes beyond traditional efforts in this regime and was particularly well integrated with the research.

0.05,"This grant supports investigation on large quantum fluctuations of energy density and pressure and their physical effects. Recent work by the PI and his collaborators has shown that these fluctuations are much less rare than previously thought. Large pressure fluctuations may be able to push quantum particles, such as electrons, over potential barriers at a rate which might be observable and have technological consequences. Large energy density fluctuations can cause the nucleation of bubbles of a new phase in the early universe, which could play a role in the evolution of the universe. These fluctuations can also alter the gravitational field and influence the propagation of light rays. This is an effect of quantum gravity, and its study will help to elucidate the relation between quantum theory and relativity theory, which is one of the unsolved problems of theoretical physics. The project will also study analog models for quantum gravity involving nonlinear optics, and the results may lead to a deeper understanding of optics, as well as quantum gravity. Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research. Some of the results of the project should help to illustrate subtle concepts of quantum theory and relativity to students.<br/><br/>This research will focus on the probability distributions for spacetime averages of quantum stress tensor operators. Past work on this topic has focused only on time averages. Here the effects of spatial averaging will also be included. The applications of the probability distributions to several systems will also be investigated. These include the effects of stress tensor fluctuations in enhancing the rates for quantum barrier penetration and in increasing the rates of false vacuum decay, both of which could have significant applications. The role of stress tensor fluctuations in driving spacetime geometry fluctuations will also be studied. One effect of geometry fluctuations will be light cone fluctuations. One approach to be used is an analog model in which squared electric field vacuum fluctuations in a nonlinear dielectric cause light speed fluctuations. This effect can give useful insights into quantum gravity effects, and is of interest in its own right and might be experimentally observable. The role of stress tensor fluctuation in cosmological models will also be studied."

0.3263,"This project concerns the investigation of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), namely the Einstein equations in general relativity, the geometry of the solution spacetimes and their implications in physics and astrophysics. One of the main aims of the proposed research is to derive a complete theory for the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves displacing test masses permanently. This will include answering the questions whether there exists such an effect for neutrino radiation as present in binary neutron star mergers and if there is a cosmological memory effect. The goal is to give a detailed geometric-analytic description in the various scenarios and to apply the mathematics to experiments. The PI has already made contributions in this direction in the recent past. The emerging results of the project are expected to answer fundamental physical questions about gravitational radiation, the source objects in astrophysics and the very early period of our universe. Since the pioneering article by D. Christodoulou, where he derived the nonlinear memory effect (also called the Christodoulou effect), it had been an outstanding problem if electromagnetic fields coupled to the Einstein equations affect this nonlinear phenomenon. The PI with collaborators P. Chen and S.-T. Yau solved the problem, proving that the electromagnetic field in the Einstein-Maxwell (EM) equations enlarges the Christodoulou effect. Working with Christodoulou's geometric-analytic approach for the Einstein vacuum equations and N. Zipser's analysis of the EM equations, the PI, Chen and Yau established novel results and methods in the geometric analysis of the EM equations. The geometric-analytic investigations by Christodoulou as well as by the PI with Chen and Yau allowed the authors to deduce exact solutions describing the related effects precisely and for all data. In particular, the results hold for large data such as binary black hole or binary neutron star mergers. Geometric analysis has since proven to be the most powerful method to tackle these problems. In the study of the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves, null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian geometry play a crucial role. This is due to the fact that gravitational waves travel along such null hypersurfaces and experiments are performed at null infinity. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of the latter has to be understood. D. Christodoulou and S. Klainerman in their work ""The global nonlinear stability of the Minkowski space"" developed new techniques to investigate those. The PI generalized their work and established the borderline case from the point of view of decay of the data. In a research monograph of 300 pages the PI obtained numerous new results that can be applied to other problems in geometry and analysis. The main method and its developments have recently led to the solution of some of the most challenging problems in mathematical physics. The new project will use new ideas from the PI's recent work and it is expected to yield further new results in general relativity (GR), geometry and PDE analysis. The educational component of the proposal focuses on disseminating knowledge of mathematics, physics and astrophysics as well as historic background to the public. Aiming at the creation of an exhibit at the Museum of Natural History at the PI's home University combining geometry and analysis with astrophysics, the educational project will include student work at undergraduate and graduate levels. Together with the PI and the museum staff, they will be involved in teaching at high schools working on the project. At public events organized by the museum the PI will collaborate with the museum staff to present activities to enhance learning. Research results will be presented in a simplified way and adapted to the audience. The project is designed as to reach out to a very broad public including minority groups, families with small kids, schools at all levels and will have an appealing component for everyone. Some of the long-lasting impacts will be new activities for high school classes to teach mathematics by introducing concepts of physics combined with history and art. <br/><br/>The geometric nature of general relativity singles out geometric analysis to be the perfect research field to answer the many physical questions. The laws of GR are the Einstein equations, linking the curvature of spacetime to its matter content. Exploring these equations will lead to a better understanding of the universe as a whole and of isolated systems such as galaxies, binary black holes or binary neutron stars. To unravel the complex interplay between geometry, analysis and physics is one of the main goals in GR. This project aims to investigate this beautiful interaction. Along the way, the mathematical tools developed promise to bear fruit in the analysis of the many structurally similar nonlinear PDEs. Through the educational component, the PI's research will also have direct impact in a broader sense via the afore-mentioned activities. The PI will complement the outreach by attending conferences to communicate her results. She will also make her results available via internet and publications."
0.269,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Savdeep Sethi at the University of Chicago. <br/><br/>The origins of space and time are one of the enduring mysteries of nature. Did space and time emerge in some kind of Big Bang? Will the universe end in a Big Crunch? Can we sensibly describe these singular highly quantum states of nature? In order to answer such basic questions about the nature of space and time, we need a quantum theory of gravity. String theory remains the best candidate for such a theory. In his research, Professor Sethi aims to explore static and dynamical aspects of string theory and quantum field theory. The static aspects include new ways of curling up the extra dimensions of string theory to arrive at a four-dimensional universe. These new types of compactification are closely tied to the dynamics of chiral gauge theory in two dimensions. The dynamical aspects include the study of stringy domain walls. These walls are bubbles of inflating space-time, quite similar to the conventional branes of string theory, which offer the possibility of a holographic definition of quantum gravity in an accelerating universe. <br/><br/>This project is also expected to have significant broader impacts. Professor Sethi will involve graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in his research, thereby providing mentoring to junior physicists studying string theory and quantum field theory. He also intends to interact with high-school students and undergraduates through continued participation in the Chicago REU program and the Space Explorers inner-city K-12 enrichment program. The final aspect of the broader impacts comes from improved interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, through direct collaboration, and by organizing workshops at the interface between these disciplines."
0.0352,"Description: This project supports participation of eleven U.S. scientists at the International Colloquium on Modern Quantum Field Theory at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay, India between January 8 and 14, 1990. The meeting is to concentrate on quantum field theory, string theory and quantum gravity. It is intended to take stock of recent developments in the field and appraise its present trends and future directions. Among the themes to be focused on are: String theory (3 sessions); Conformal field gravity (2 sessions); Topological properties of quantum field theory (2 sessions); and Quantum gravity and the cosmological constant (2 sessions). Six days of lectures are planned, of five one hour lectures each day and seminars of shorter duration. It is expected that about fifty scientists will participate including twenty from outside India. Scope: The topics covered in the meeting are among the most exciting in theoretical physics at present, the group of U.S. scientists to participate are well chosen to represent experienced, well established scientists as well as young promising post-doctoral fellows. The participation of U.S., physicists would contribute greatly to a growing interaction of Indian and U.S. scientists in the field. The Indian host institute is a world class research organization fully suited for managing such an activity."
0.602099,"Textiles were fundamental elements of material culture in the Norse colonies of the North Atlantic, gaining such importance in Iceland that cloth was used as currency throughout the medieval period. Textiles were woven according to strict legal standards and guidelines that regulated the length of legal cloth as well as thread counts. Understanding the changes in textile production through time can help shed light on how people adapted their material culture to a changing cultural dynamic as well as changing climates. In addition, because cloth was produce by women and decisions about textiles resided in the household with women, this research helps us to understand not only how Norse society adapted its technology during a cooling climatic period by weaving thicker, warmer cloth, but also how such environmental change might impact basic social structures such as household decision making processes. This research can be a window into how social, cultural and economic systems will adapt to contemporary climate shifts and assist in preparing us for potential changes.<br/><br/>The project builds upon the PI?s former research taking advantage of the exceptionally well-preserved archaeological textile material to provide insights into the social contexts of textiles from the North Atlantic islands over a course 1000 years (ca. 800s-1800s AD). The overall aim is to gain a better understanding of the lives of women- frequently invisible in the archaeological record- and their role in developing trade and shaping the economies of the Norse societies. The designation of weaving as women's trade is rooted in the gendered cosmologies that prohibited men to enter weaving huts and engage in textile work in pre-Christian era Iceland. Ca. 1200 AD textiles emerge as currency commodity, showing consistent trend toward standardization, which continues through the 16th century, suggesting at least three centuries of co-existence between standardized fish (Cod, a key component of the Norse and world economy, including the first commodities market) and standardized cloth. Aware of the differences in the legacies of the approaches to weaving in Iceland and Greenland, the PI aspires to explore the variation between those, Faroes, and Norse Scottish Isles and asks what can be learned about expression of regional identities, Little Ice Age adaptations, and roles of women.<br/><br/><br/>The PI will conduct on-site analyses of museum collections of materials from 6 Icelandic sites, 22 Greenlandic Norse sites, 1medieval Faroese site, and 21 Norse sites of Scotland; analysis includes extensive typologies, AMS dates, and dye identification. Part of the effort includes isotopic analysis that will attempt to trace movements of textiles and wool and possible trade networks across the region. This component is pitched as a pilot project that will assess the feasibility of using strontium and carbon isotopes on wool - a developing methodology that may help define the locale of the grasses consumed by sheep. Isotope analysis aims to connect the archeological record to the historical sources, which suggests that in early 1100s Icelandic textiles served as clothing material for the poor in England, Norway, and Germany."
0.025,"This award funds the research of Professor Joel W. Walker at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.<br/><br/>Research activities are to include the phenomenological investigation of topics broadly related to the subject of ""supersymmetry"", as well as the engineering and distribution of original software tools enhancing the productivity and efficiency of this and related studies. Supersymmetry is an idea that may protect the relatively light mass of the Higgs Boson observed by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 from drifting to a much heavier value. It works by hypothesizing the existence of a new class of particles whose interactions would naturally cancel the destabilizing effects of the known particles. These supersymmetric particles simultaneously provide a suitable candidate for the cosmological ""dark matter"" and are themselves a primary target for discovery in collisions at the LHC. Efforts to clarify the role of supersymmetry in low energy physics, and the search for new fundamental particles and interactions, benefit the national interest in advancing basic scientific knowledge. Sam Houston State University is a primarily undergraduate institution that takes pride in its proportional over-representation of female, minority, and low-income students. Specific activities will be designated for undergraduate participation that are sufficiently narrow and systematic in scope for students to productively engage at an early juncture, even as they are becoming more widely educated. This real-world research exposure offers broader impacts on self-confidence, team integration, algorithmic problem solving, and systematic handling of data, while enhancing the likelihood of transitioning a successful high-energy physics graduate student. <br/><br/>More technically, specific topics itemized for investigation include experimental signatures of novel supersymmetric mass hierarchies, isolation of distinctive decay modes such as long-chain cascades, contemporary applications of collider discriminants such as a boosted event topology, methods for probing the spin composition of dark matter, and the phenomenology of well motivated alternatives to the minimal supersymmetric picture such as string-derived large volume scenarios and decays of the higgsino to the singlino dark matter candidate in the NMSSM. A key methodology employed in the prior will be the numerical generation and analysis of Monte Carlo collider data simulations. Support for these objectives will also be rendered by the authoring, documentation, and dissemination of programs useful to similarly interested researchers, e.g. for safe, fast computation of the asymmetric 2-step MT2 event statistic, and for the expeditious selection, optimization, analysis, and visualization of simulated collider event data."

0.15,"The most challenging problem in theoretical physics is the unification of the laws of quantum physics with Einstein's general theory of relativity. The ideas in this direction that have been pursued most forcefully are superstring theory and noncommutative geometry. These two approaches are intimately related. Noncommutative geometry has provided a new framework to study spaces which could not be handled by the standard methods of Riemannian geometry. It offered a new perspective in the study of gauge theories and the role of the Higgs field and is a promising candidate to describe geometries at Planckian energies. In the past years it has been established that space-time is approximated by a well defined product of a continuous four-dimensional manifold by a finite dimensional space. The main focus of this program is to construct a genuinely noncommutative finite dimensional space valid at sub-planckian scales and whose limit at lower energies is the noncommutative space of the standard model. The geometry will be reduced to those of almost commuting matrices, and it will be possible to get a handle on quantizing the geometry. It will also study new asymptotic limits of the spectral action as well as cosmological implications. Other parts of this project will study various aspects of gravity such as stability of BPS monopoles, and formulation of consistent massive theories of gravity, implications of the presence of right-handed neutrinos on the geometry of spacetime, the behavior of spectral actions in the presence of singularities and non-perturbative evolution of the dynamical fields at scales of the order of the Planck length. <br/>Broader impact of Project: Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this work which involves research on the frontiers of noncommutative geometry, will be of benefit to both physicists and mathematicians. The new ideas and methods in this proposal will contribute to the knowledge of the high energy theory and phenomenology, quantum gravity and mathematics communities, and to a lesser extent to the astro-physics community. The American University of Beirut (AUB) plays a very important role in promoting the American educational system in the Middle East. Historically, the emphasis was on liberal education. The new aim is to provide in addition a vibrant environment for the promotion of research. The launching of the Ph.D. program in theoretical physics in October 2009 is a step in that direction and is attracting students of high caliber."

0.46247,"Gamma-ray astronomy impacts a broad range of key science questions: indirect dark matter detection and tests of fundamental physical laws; cosmological studies; jet physics associated with active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and microquasars; and particle acceleration in galactic tevatrons and pevatrons. Today, extremely sensitive instruments operate in the high energy (AGILE and FERMI in the range 100 MegaelectronVolt (MeV) - 100 GigaelectronVolt (GeV)) and very high energy (VHE) (HAWC, HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS at energies greater than 100 GeV;) regimes simultaneously. Among the most exciting results from VERITAS are the detection of emission from the Crab Pulsar above 100 GeV (requiring the presence of a new emission component), the discovery of gamma-ray emission from a starburst galaxy, M82 (firmly associating cosmic-ray acceleration with star-forming regions), and the detection of correlated variability in the radio and Teraelectronvolt (TeV) regimes in radio galaxies (helping to constrain the emission to be originating within the jet collimation region). The upper limit on the gamma-ray emission from the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy set by VERITAS rules out most of the leptophilic dark matter parameter space favored by recent cosmic-ray positron measurements. A major upgrade to the VERITAS cameras during summer 2012 introduced high-quantum-efficiency photo multiplier tubes to lower the energy threshold of the array by 30%, and the array will be further augmented by the arrival in 2015 of a prototype 10 meter class Schwarzschild-Couder telescope under development for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). <br/><br/>Following the recent VERITAS hardware upgrade, great promise for further improving the science potential of the instrument comes from a focus on data analysis. This CAREER award provides support for developing major improvements in VERITAS data analysis methods aimed at lowering the analysis threshold, improving angular and energy resolution, and increasing background discrimination. It will also support analysis of VERITAS data to search for dark matter signals from the Galactic Halo, Fermi unassociated sources, and related targets, as well as studies of Galactic accelerators of cosmic rays. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The science of VERITAS and CTA - searching for dark matter and investigating the most powerful cosmic accelerators - has broad applications to both astro- and particle physics, and addresses questions that can capture the public's imagination. Group members will share that excitement via public lectures at area high schools and to groups in the local Morningside Heights and Harlem areas of Manhattan and Westchester County, and by engaging undergraduates and area high school students in the group's research activities. As a centerpiece to tie together these outreach activities, the group plans to develop a Visitor Center at Nevis Labs that will occupy both physical and virtual spaces and provide a focal point for visiting groups to learn about the history and current research at Nevis."
1.25949,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This proposal requests support for the development of a state-of-the-art polarization-sensitive receiver SPT-POL that will be used to conduct a program of cosmological research with the 10-meter South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT-POL will be installed on the SPT and used to measure the polarization anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation from scales of an arcminute to degrees, starting in austral winter 2012. From the analysis of the resulting polarization maps, the project will determine the angular power spectrum of the CMB B-mode polarization (curl component) induced by the lensing of the intrinsic E-mode polarization (curl-free component) by large-scale structures. The lensing B-mode spectrum provides sensitivity to the neutrino masses through their impact on the growth of the large-scale, lensing structure. The project will also search for the large angular scale B-mode polarization signal imprinted on the CMB by inflationary gravitational waves generated in the first instants of the Universe. Detection of the inflationary B-mode spectrum would be a spectacular test of the Inflation theory of the origin of the Universe and will set the energy scale of the Inflationary epoch. In addition to the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropy data, the obtained datasets will include a wealth of information including catalogs of massive galaxy clusters and extragalactic millimeter and submillimeter sources. Continued reliance on students provides a broader impact of this proposed research and firmly grounds this effort in its educational mission. The project will contribute significantly to the training of the next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with technology and instrumentation development, astronomical field observations, and scientific analysis. The sharing of forefront research with non-scientists will be extended beyond the university through a well-established and vibrant educational network that reaches a wide audience at all levels of the educational continuum."
0.45,"Gravitational-wave (GW) searches using LIGO's landmark fifth and sixth science runs have led to major observational results, including astrophysical constraints that have begun to surpass those from electromagnetic or particle observations. Preparations for the start of the advanced detector era are now eagerly underway, with LIGO, Virgo and GEO600 in a transition period and new interferometers under construction. These advanced detectors, expected to come on-line starting around 2015, will be ~10 times more sensitive, searching a volume of the Universe ~1000 times larger than at present, virtually guaranteeing the first detection of GWs. This award supports research in areas that are relevant to LIGO data analysis during this transition period, and that will build the foundation for techniques required in the advanced detector era: (i) searches for a cosmological or astrophysical GW background, (ii) statistical searches for GWs from gamma-ray bursts, (iii) developing new methods to search for GWs from supernovae, and (iv) detector characterization.<br/><br/>The first project will improve our sensitivity to GW backgrounds using the most recent data from both the LIGO and Virgo detectors. The second will develop methods to optimally use the information contained in the electromagnetic or particle signature of an astrophysical event (such as gamma-ray data from NASA missions like Swift and Fermi) in GW searches. The third will explore methods to enhance the sensitivity of searches involving GWs from weak sources like supernovae, and the fourth will look into the detector data to characterize low-frequency non-stationary noise and track possible instrumental artefacts as well. The graduate students supported by this grant will receive direct training in GW data analysis, thus adding to the growing community of researchers in this field. Since the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is an Hispanic serving institution, the research activities will expose students who are traditionally under-represented in the areas of science and technology to forefront scientific research. On-going major outreach programs at UTB will be able to leverage this research, creating awareness among high-school students about exciting scientific projects such as LIGO."
0.2,"Binary black hole systems are among the most interesting and likely sources of gravitational waves for both the current generation of ground-based detectors, such as LIGO, and for the next generation of space-based detectors, such as LISA.

Little is known, however, about their population, formation, evolution, and gravitational wave production.<br/><br/>This research will address certain key aspects of black hole binary systems which are at the current boundary of what is technically feasible and what is needed for successful detection and description of these systems. Work will be initiated to make the numerical simulations of the final plunge of comparable mass black hole binaries run longer and more stably to produce longer and more reliable waveforms for use in data analysis. The goal of this research, which combines analytic and numerical techniques, is to provide a series of increasingly realistic predictions. <br/><br/>This research at the Hispanic-serving University of Texas at Brownsville will aid in the further development of a research environment in which both graduate and undergraduate students can flourish as scientists, by exposing them to timely front-line research in the company of leading postdoctoral researchers from around the world. Such an environment is crucial in allowing a traditionally under-represented Hispanic population to participate more fully in the national and international scientific communities."
0.492293,"Dr. McKee and his group investigate star formation and its history to study the processes governing the evolution of the universe. The star formation history determines the structure and evolution of galaxies, and the production of the chemical elements over time. This work addresses three central problems in the theory of star formation. <br/>(1) The role of magnetic fields in the formation of low-mass stars. Magnetic fields affect their formation as stars cannot from if the field is too strong. The group uses a numerical magneto-radiative hydrodynamic - adaptive mesh refinement code to simulate the effects of magnetic fields on star formation. Large scale star formation in giant molecular clouds is affected by the shape of the magnetic field in these clouds. Observations support both hypotheses that either the field is ordered or tangled. Detailed simulations will be compared to observations to resolve this issue. On intermediate scales, processes during star cluster formation influences the star formation rates and the stellar masses. Simulations that include the effects of radiation and outflows from protostars forming out of a magnetized medium will provide a more complete picture of star formation in clusters. One smaller scales, magnetic fields are effective at extracting the rotational energy of the gas in disks that have been observed around forming and recently formed stars. Most star formation simulations to date result in either no disks at all, or in disks that are much smaller than observed. Here high resolution simulations with all relevant physical processes that couple the gas to the magnetic field are carried out to address this issue.<br/>(2) The rate of star formation through cosmic time. The evolution of disk galaxies like the Milky Way depends on the rate at which gas accretes onto the galaxy and the rate at which this gas is transformed into stars. Gas accretion has been determined by large scale cosmological simulations. The PI has contributed to the development of two complementary theories of the star formation rate. These theories will be unified and, with simulations, extended to the case when heavy element abundances were low in the early universe. The results can serve as ingredients for more accurate theories of the evolution of galaxies.<br/>(3) The formation of the first stars. The very first stars formed out of gas that had essentially no elements heavier than Helium. When these stars exploded at the end of their lives, they seeded the universe with the first heavy elements. The amount of heavy elements produced depends sensitively on the mass of these stars. This mass was likely affected by of the energetic radiation emitted by the stars as they formed, which will be studied in the highest resolution simulations yet performed in order to determine the mass of the first stars.<br/>This award supports a postdoctoral researcher. The computational methodologies developed as part of this project will be published for use by the community."

0.322436,"The PI's work will be divided into two parts, identifying new ""gravitational lens"" systems at extragalactic distances and observations of cool stars with coronae. The PI will be conducting observations of gravitational lens candidates first identified in the MIT-Green Bank radio survey. In collaboration with J. Lehar, D. Roberts, and B. Burke, she has just completed monitoring the gravitational lens 0957+561. These measurements have resulted in a lens time delay, which can be used to put limits on the cosmological Hubble's constant. Observations are commencing on the Einstein ring system MG1131+0456, aimed at characterizing its radio light curve in order to determine whether time delay measurements can be made with this object as well. The PI will also conduct observations on active cool main sequence (""dMe"") stars to determine whether they have low-mass companions. These observations will be made with a variety of collaborators in the U.S. and France. Trial observations to date have succeeded in detecting the presence of ""coronae"" around such active stars as YZ CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo. Further observations of these stars will be made to determine the extents of these coronae around the stars exciting them."
0.1434,"The main concern of this project is to study smooth simply connected 4-manifolds by using invariants obtained from gauge theory. In particular, the investigator wishes to use 2-torsion instanton invariants to study the result of taking connected sums with S2 x S2. Using the relation of these torsion invariants with the usual Donaldson invariants and using Z2-invariant theory, the investigator hopes to deduce universal relations for certain Donaldson invariants. He also plans to search for the proper setting for relative torsion invariants. The interactions of this project with mathematical physics go both ways. On the one hand, four-dimensional manifolds are cosmologically important, since we live in a manifold of three space dimensions and one time dimension. On the other hand, and more surprisingly, notions from quantum mechanics have led to new topological invariants of manifolds."
0.1359,"A closed aspherical manifold is a compact connected manifold whose universal cover is contractible. Let M and N be closed aspherical manifolds, and let F be an isomorphism of their fundamental groups. Borel conjectured that F is always induced by a homeomorphism f of the manifolds. The investigator, in collaboration with L. E. Jones of SUNY-Stony Brook, intends to try to settle this conjecture. Partial results by the investigator and Jones were the main results of the previous N.S.F. grant (DMS-8801312). The project also relates to problems in differential geometry and algebraic K-theory; e.g., does Wh(G) vanish for every torsion-free group G? Manifolds are locally Euclidean spaces, which makes them very natural objects of study. For example, the physical world in which we live has three space dimensions and (in some contexts) a time dimension, making it either a three-dimensional or four-dimensional manifold. Thus the instant project to understand better the structure of manifolds might even have cosmological significance."

The second part will focus on the construction of fake smooth structures on 4-manifolds, particularly their detection by means of such new invariants as Floer homology and the still newer invariants of Turaev-Reshetikhin-Witten coming from quantum groups.

4.0001,"This award is for continuing support of research at the millimeter wave interferometer, operated by the California Institute of Technology in Owens Valley, California. The Principle Investigator, one of the world leaders in millimeter wave astronomy and radio interferometry, directs one of the most creative and productive groups of astronomers in the world. These workers have not only pioneered in the application of millimeter wave technology to important astronomical problems, but have also been instrumental in developing the technology itself. Objects to be investigated under this award range from our own solar system to the most distant galaxies. The first global measurement of Martian winds is expected, using absorption features of carbon monoxide. The high resolution of the three element array (soon to be expanded to six elements or more) will permit detailed mapping of circumstellar structure associated with young stellar objects - possibly planetary systems in the making. The great sensitivity of this instrument will allow the extension of cosmological studies of the Hubble expansion, now frequently conducted with the 21 cm radiation of neutral hydrogen, to the use of the millimeter wavelength lines of carbon monoxide. This will broaden the base of galaxies for which high accuracy red-shifts may be obtained."
0.3679,"This award funds continuing studies of one of the worlds leading groups of theoretical cosmologists. Wroking at the interfaces of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics, these investigations will refine our understanding of light element evolution, big bang nucleosynthesis, supernova neutrino physics and the interplay of early and late stage particle physics phase transitions with galaxy and structure formation and the dark matter problem."
0.1679,"A striking feature of the development of mathematics in the past decade has been the extent to which the diverse branches of mathematics have interacted, with methods from one branch being used to solve outstanding problems in another. Culler and Shalen's ongoing program for obtaining lower bounds for volumes of hyperbolic manifolds is in large measure an application of qualitative results from topology to quantitative estimates in geometry. Their program for the Property P conjecture would be likely to exploit K-theory and arithmetic geometry in attacking a problem from the topological theory of 3-manifolds. Culler's project of implementing Manin's program by means of Thurston's theory of pleated surfaces is a way of using synthetic hyperbolic geometry to obtain insight into number theory. Finally, Shalen's project involving fundamental groups of 2-complexes lies in the domain of geometric and combinatorial group theory but is motivated in part by the prospect of applications to the study of discrete subgroups of algebraic groups and Kac-Moody groups. Three-dimensional manifolds are the mathematical models of our physical universe. While the cosmological question of whether our universe is finite may be unresolved, it is certain that the study of finite-volume 3-manifolds is of fundamental importance in understanding the physical universe. The quantitative estimates obtained by Culler and Shalen may be regarded as being mathematical analogues of measurements of fundamental physical constants, such as the speed of light. The geometry, as well as the topology, of the universe is important in physics. While the non-euclidean geometries may have been considered curiosities in the nineteenth century, the development of general relativity shows that negatively curved spaces, such as hyperbolic 3-manifolds, are the appropriate models for the universe. Recent mathematical research has shown that they are ubiquitous and mathematically rich as well. The research proposed here is aimed at expanding our understanding of these important spaces."
0.140992,"The proposed research is on Floer homology and its applications to low-dimensional topology. Floer homology is an infinite dimensional version of Morse theory which has been used to construct various invariants of knots, 3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, etc. In turn, these invariants can answer subtle questions about the respective topological objects. One source of invariants with numerous topological applications is Heegaard Floer theory. For example, the Heegaard Floer invariant for knots (called knot Floer homology) is able to detect the genus of a knot. Originally, all the Heegaard Floer invariants were defined in terms of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symmetric products. Recently, knot Floer homology has been given several combinatorial descriptions. One focus of this project is to find combinatorial descriptions for the Heegaard Floer three- and four-manifold invariants as well. In other directions, the PI will work on finding connections between knot Floer homology and other knot invariants, such as the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies; intepreting the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies geometrically; developing Floer homotopy theory; and constructing new Floer-theoretic invariants of three-manifolds using moduli spaces of flat connections.<br/><br/>Floer homology plays a central role in the construction of topological quantum field theories. These are toy models used in Mathematical Physics to develop quantum theories about the universe. They are also of interest to topologists, who study the possible shapes of space in various dimensions. An important problem is the classification of these shapes, and this is particularly difficult in four dimensions. Floer homology and the associated invariants are some of the most useful tools for detecting properties of four-dimensional shapes. Because our macroscopic space-time has four dimensions, this is an essential input for quantum physicists and cosmologists looking for geometric models for the universe. Furthermore, recently Floer homology has found surprising applications in biology, more precisely in the analysis of DNA knotting."
0.408,"Astrophysical observations and cosmological data have led to the unambiguous conclusion that nearly a quarter of the Universe consists of dark matter. The search for dark matter addresses one of the fundamental questions in particle astrophysics. Current models predict that our galaxy is encased in a halo of dark matter. As the Sun orbits around the galaxy and the Earth around the Sun, we expect there to be an annual modulation in the flux of dark matter that passes through the Earth. If the modulation observed by the DAMA experiment in Italy is due to dark matter, an experiment in the Southern Hemisphere with the same target material would expect to observe modulations with the same phase and amplitude. This would be unambiguous evidence for the observation of dark matter. If the modulation is due to an environmental background related to the seasons, it will be opposite in the two hemispheres.<br/><br/>This award will fund an integrated research and education program focused on the development of sodium iodide-(NaI)-based detectors for dark matter physics. The research program consists of three main activities: analysis of data from a 17 kilogram NaI detector currently operating 2500 meters below the surface in the South Pole ice, a systematic study of the characteristics and pulse shape discrimination techniques of NaI detectors, and the simulations and sensitivity studies for a proposed 250 kilogram NaI detector to be mounted in the Southern Hemisphere. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This award will also fund a series of educational and outreach activities designed to recruit and retain physics majors and physicists in STEM fields by showcasing the wide range of careers available to physicists. A special focus will be given to recruit and retain women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in physics."
0.32,"This CAREER award funds the research activities of Professor Luis Anchordoqui at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee.<br/><br/>After nearly twenty years of planning and construction, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is now the highest-energy particle collider in the world. Data from the LHC is likely to lead to nothing less than a new Standard Model for the next generation of particle physicists, describing the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at an even higher energy scale. In his research, Professor Anchordoqui aims to develop methods by which a certain class of new theories beyond the Standard Model might be tested at the LHC. This class of new theories includes those in which the myriad of particle types in the Standard Model is replaced by a single fundamental building block: a ""string."" One critical component of Anchordoqui's work is to explore the various properties of string resonances related to experimental searches for new physics at the LHC. He is also involved in complementary cosmological and astrophysical observations, which aid his search for string theory's smoking gun and help unravel the mysteries of the Universe's unseen dimensions.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Anchordoqui will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results and develop new course curricula based on results from the LHC."
0.3865,"The likely detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources will open a new window for astronomy and provide new tests of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Interpreting the observations and advancing this new field will require accurate theoretical predictions for the wave signal from a given source. This project will make use of a method known as Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE), that has been developed by the PI and his students at Washington University, which solves Einstein's equations systematically in a procedure known as the post-Newtonian approximation (appropriate for systems where the velocities are small compared to the speed of light). Using this method, it will be possible to study the detailed motion and radiation from the inspiral of compact binary systems (double star systems containing neutron stars or black holes) to a high degree of accuracy. Post-Newtonian methods will also be used to study unusual aspects of the curved spacetime surrounding rotating black holes, related to the existence of the so-called ""Carter"" constant of the motion, and to calculate the recoil velocity experienced by black holes formed from compact binary merger. Ways to use gravitational-wave data to test alternative theories of gravity in new regimes and to measure astrophysical and cosmological parameters will also be studied. In particular, a detailed analysis of gravitational radiation from compact binary inspiral in a class of ""scalar-tensor"" alternatives to general relativity will be carried out, together with a study of data analysis strategies for placing the best possible bound on this class of theories. The possibility of testing general relativity in the strong-field vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy using future adaptive optics infrared interferometry will be analyzed by studying orbital perturbations of stars in close orbits near the hole caused by other stars in the central region, by a possible distribution of dark matter, and by tidal distortions of the stars. This will involve a mixture of analytical post-Newtonian calculations and numerical N- body simulations.<br/><br/>The work on equations of motion, gravitational waveforms and analysis of gravitational-wave data will impact the emerging field of gravitational-wave astronomy. The work on recoil velocities may contribute important insights that could impact astrophysical modeling of the growth of massive black holes in galaxies, as well as the interface between post-Newtonian theory and numerical relativity. The work on testing general relativity near the galactic center black hole could impact the development of advanced instrumentation for observational infrared astronomy. Education and training of students will be integrated into the research program."

The primary scientific driver is weak gravitational lensing, but the survey also enables other investigations, such as optical transient phenomena, whose existence is publicized within about an hour of the observation. It allows the definition of mass-selected clusters of galaxies and of mass concentrations in three dimensions, and the final combination of cosmic shear and cluster counting will place sharp limits on cosmological parameters, and is complementary to other probes. The DLS is the first NOAO Survey to release both images and calibrated photometric catalogs, is 70% complete, and so far has been largely privately funded. This specific public support is for otherwise un-funded team members to complete the Survey and release the final products, building on the progress so far.<br/><br/>Algorithms developed for the DLS have wider applicability, and the released data products are already in use for both formal and informal education at several levels, including high schools and museums. The DLS is also a useful learning tool for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a priority in the decadal survey report summarizing the astronomical community's consensus of priorities.<br/>***"
0.165,"The proposed research will focus on finding a theory beyond the standard model of elementary particle physics that will be capable of explaining quantities such as the pattern of quark and lepton masses. String theory is a potential candidate theory to solve this problem, however the theory has many degenerate ground states labeled by the value of the moduli fields. Thus the predictability of the masses problem is replaced by being able to determine the value of the moduli fields. The goal of this research effort is to compute the value of all the moduli fields in a realistic model. The approach is to introduce warped space times that naturally generate large hierarchies of physical scales. The PI proposes to determine the properties of the background geometry of string compactifications in the presence of fluxes. This might make it possible to determine the nature of broken supersymmetry and allow a determination of the cosmological constant."

This project will carry out high-resolution two-fluid simulations of AGN-heated cluster cores, including correct treatment of cosmic-ray pressure and buoyancy, turbulent mixing, and thermal conduction, as well as test-particle simulations of electron diffusion in turbulent magnetic fields, to improve previous approximate theories of thermal conduction. The investigation will rigorously test whether AGN heating solves the cooling flow problem, and will also show how to modify cluster-formation simulations to account for these two important heating mechanisms. This will lead to a better understanding of the relation between cluster masses and observables, and assist cluster surveys to constrain cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>The project includes junior researcher training, but also a major outreach effort through the University's Upward Bound Project, which targets low-income and first-generation students."
0.14,"A shock wave is a propagating disturbance in a liquid, gas, or plasma (a fluid in physics terminology) that is characterized by an abrupt change in fluid properties, such as density or pressure, across the wave front. Shock waves are ubiquitous in nature, from quantum levels to cosmological scales. They occur in a great variety of physically important phenomena, such as the air flow around an airliner's wing, flows of dense granular materials, fluids undergoing liquid-solid or vapor-liquid phase transitions, magneto-hydrodynamics, nonlinear elasticity, and many other important situations. The mathematical theory describing realistic multi-dimensional dynamics for these phenomena is under-developed. This project will focus on several important problems whose solution holds the promise of elucidating general phenomena. In particular, the project will consider the glancing shock reflection problem (that originated from the problem initially proposed by John von Neumann), formation of shocks in supersonic regimes, and others. The project will bring high-performance computing to bear on the understanding of these problems; the numerical solutions obtained have the potential to lead to advances in the theory.<br/><br/>This project addresses the mathematical modeling and analysis of a number of multi-dimensional Riemann problems whose solutions contain classical or nonclassical shocks. A common theme of much of the work in this project is the formulation of problems using asymptotic model equations that retain the essential physics present in the underlying governing equations. These asymptotic models can then be solved numerically, enabling vastly greater numerical resolution to be achieved in regions where the solutions exhibit small-scale features. The project addresses fundamental questions in compressible fluid flow and nonlinear hyperbolic systems, including those systems that admit small-scale dependent shocks (examples include models for magneto-hydrodynamics, phase transitions, complex fluids, etc.). The mathematical theory of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, and more generally of hyperbolic conservation laws, is largely incomplete in more than one space dimension, and the project will attack a number of multidimensional problems that are likely to be amenable to solution. Numerical solutions of these problems have the potential to lead to the development of the theory and resolve various paradoxes in the existing theories."

Unfortunately, experimental determination of structure relies on observations of luminous galaxies, whose formation involves gas dynamics, star formation, and the feedback of entropy into the interstellar medium. These processes are complex, hampering direct simulation. As a result, the detailed relationship between luminous galaxies and their dark matter environments (the ""bias"") is poorly determined.<br/>This uncertainty seriously limits our ability to compare cosmological observations of galaxies to theoretical models. This program will conduct a closely coordinated observational and theoretical study of the relationship between luminous galaxies and their dark matter environments. McKay and his students will pursue weak lensing measurements within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, while Evrard and Wechsler will make parallel measurements within N-body simulations. This will allow direct comparison of theory and observation at the level of the fundamental observables, without recourse to intermediate model fitting. By comparing lensing measurements to parallel studies of simulations this work will probe bias in new ways.<br/>***"
0.18,"The investigator will devise, improve, and analyze methods for the numerical simulation of complex physical phenomena modeled by partial differential equations, emphasizing three main areas: mixed methods for elasticity equations, discontinuous Galerkin methods, and computational general relativity. For elasticity, the investigator will build on a recent breakthrough that enabled the construction of the first stable mixed finite element methods for the displacement-stress formulations with polynomial trial functions, and also work towards the development of simpler nonconforming mixed finite element methods and extensions to three dimensional elasticity problems. Concerning discontinuous Galerkin methods--finite element methods in which the approximating piecewise polynomial functions are discontinuous, with modifications incorporated into the variational formulation to achieve consistency--the investigator will work with his collaborators to build on recent work on the unification and classification of such methods to develop a unified approach to the analysis of and discrimination among a wide class of discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic equations. Application will also be made to the numerical simulation of elastic plates incorporating shear. The third and largest effort concerns the numerical solution of Einstein's field equations relating mass and the curvature of space-time. The emphasis here will be on understanding the fundamental properties of the Einstein equations most relevant to their numerical solution and the basic difficulties that have beset previous attempts at numerical simulations of them. The work will be guided by the goal of simulating the coalescence of inspiralling pairs of black holes and the resulting emission of gravitational radiation, which is a problem of fundamental importance to gravitational physics and also because such simulations will be essential to realization of a new generation of observatories based on gravitational wave detectors.<br/><br/>Computer simulation is a key tool for the design and testing of complex engineering structures. In recent decades computer simulation has also joined experiment and theory as one of the main paradigms of scientific investigation. In both areas, many of the most complex systems are first modeled by systems of partial differential equations--in which the language of calculus is used to express the variations of the relevant physical quantities in space and time--and then these systems of differential equations must be approximated by numerical algorithms, which harness the power of modern computers to perform billions of arithmetical operations a seconds to extract the solutions to the equations to the required degree of accuracy. In recent decades the principles for the design and validation of such algorithms have been developed for many of the basic systems of differential equations encountered in science in technology, but many more complex systems have so far resisted effective computation, and that is the thrust of this research. A particular emphasis will be on numerical algorithms for accurate determination of the stresses internal to elastic structures, which is essential to building safe and economic engineering structures. A second emphasis will be on developing methods to simulate Einstein's equations of general relativity, especially for predicting the output of gravitational radiation--minute ripples that propagate on the curved surface of space-time--from massive cosmological events such as black hole collisions. Computer codes capable of making such predictions are needed to realize the effectiveness of a new type of observatory based on gravitational radiation currently being constructed, which will provide mankind with its first window on the dark matter that makes up 90% of the universe."
1.2,"AST-0206329<br/>Stubbs<br/>A recent convergence of observational results has led cosmologists to the surprising conclusion that not only is the Universe expanding, but that the rate of expansion is increasing. This can be thought of as anti-gravity between regions of the vacuum. It appears that the Universe at present is dominated by the gravitational effect of this mysterious Dark Energy. Distant supernovae (exploding stars) provide a means to map out the history of the expansion of the Universe, and can be used to distinguish between different scenarios for the physics that drives an accelerating expansion. This project will detect and monitor over 200 supernovae in order to test different hypotheses for the nature of the Dark Energy."
0.75,"The recently built Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) has become the premier lunar laser ranging (LLR) facility in the world, delivering one-millimeter range precision between Earth and Moon as a way to test General Relativity. General Relativity makes specific predictions about the shape of the lunar orbit, so that we may use the Moon as a laboratory, made possible by the reflectors left on the Moon by the Apollo astronauts and unmanned Soviet rovers. The goal of this work is to extend high-quality LLR observations over an additional three-year period, simultaneously collecting calibrated measurements of local gravity well enough to determine site displacements at the millimeter level. In tandem, an intensive effort will be initiated to advance the solar system model to a state that can take advantage of millimeter-quality data. It is by comparison to a complete and sophisticated model that questions relating to gravity, geophysics, and lunar physics can be explored. Though not the main focus, knowledge of the lunar interior stands to gain the most from APOLLO, as the experiment routinely acquires 4 to 5 reflectors in one session, providing exquisite measurements of the lunar orientation and distortion. But this refined knowledge of the moon will also facilitate understanding of how the moon moves in its orbit, as such information is crucial to determining the path of the Moon's center of mass through space.<br/><br/>LLR tests many fundamental aspects of gravity, like the equivalence principle, the constancy of gravity, gravitomagnetism, and the inverse-square law. Improving our knowledge of gravity therefore informs a diverse range of cosmologists, astrophysicists, particle physicists, and string theorists. This effort will also contribute to Earth and planetary science, especially via the inclusion of the superconducting gravimeter data. The open-source solar-system analysis code emerging from the project will provide an interesting platform for analyzing a wide range of data sets, including radar ranging in the solar system, Doppler radar to spacecraft around the solar system, pulsar timing experiments, etc. The same platform can form the basis of covariant studies for future proposed space missions that aim to test fundamental physics. Additionally, graduate student and postdoctoral training is a valuable component of the total effort. Finally, APOLLO will continue its strong tradition of public outreach, including featured appearances on popular television shows."

This project will use these new tools to understand universal features of this process, i.e., features which are common to a wide class of systems. As such, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the understanding of universal physical phenomena. The broader impacts resulting from this project will be to enhance the quality of undergraduate and graduate physics education, and to support frontier physics research in the Kentucky region. <br/><br/>At a more technical level, Das will study non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly coupled quantum field theories using gauge-gravity duality.

0.205805,"To study galaxies during the cosmic era of maximum star formation and supermassive black hole growth requires observing them at great distances, corresponding to cosmological redshifts between 1.5 and 3.0. The visible light emitted by these galaxies carries information about their stellar and gaseous contents; owing to the redshift, this light is observed at infrared wavelengths. The new, NSF-funded, Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I telescope represents a major development for the study of these galaxies, offering increases in sensitivity and survey efficiency by factors of approximately 5 and 100, respectively. This project, the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey, will chart the evolution of the rest-frame optical spectra for approximately 2000 galaxies between 1.5 and 3.5, more than an order of magnitude improvement over existing surveys. The project will make use of 44 nights allocated on the Keck I telescope through 2016, and will survey three well-studied regions of the sky already having extensive multi-wavelength datasets. By combining new and existing data, the proposing team will characterize the star formation and accreting black hole activity in distant galaxies, their masses, contents and structures, and the manner in which baryonic matter passes through them. In collaboration with theorists, the MOSDEF team will use these results to test and inform forefront models of galaxy evolution.

0.15,"A good portion of this award is devoted to the study of the formation of singularities, both in solutions of Einstein's equations and in solutions of Ricci flow. For Einstein's equations, one of the key issues is Strong Cosmic Censorship (""SCC""): Is it true that the ubiquitous geodesic incompleteness predicted by the Hawking-Penrose theorems generically involve spacetime curvature (and therefore gravitational tidal) blowup? At least in certain families of spacetimes defined by isometries, the determination that the solutions exhibit ""AVTD"" behavior (dominance of time derivatives of the fields over space derivatives near the singularity) is a very helpful tool for studying SCC, and is interesting in its own right. Some of our work involves the development of a framework for proving that there are large sets of smooth (non-analytic) solutions in these families which show AVTD behavior. Our studies of singularities in Ricci flow have focused on those known as ""neckpinches"". We have, in particular, shown that there is a discretely parametrized family of Ricci flow solutions which develop ""degenerate neckpinches"", with the geometry asymptotically approaching a ""Bryant soliton"" at a prescribed rate (consistent with Type 2 behavior). These solutions are all rotationally symmetric. Wanting to know if the detailed asymptotic behavior seen in these solutions is also characteristic of non-rotationally symmetric solutions, we have chosen to first address this issue in the case of mean curvature flow (""MCF""), since MCF neckpinches share many features with those of Ricci flow, and since it is easier with MCF to compare non-rotationally symmetric solutions with rotationally symmetric ones.<br/><br/>In the projects discussed above, as well as in many others in my research program, the primary goal is to develop an understanding of the general behavior of large classes of solutions of complicated nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. Such equation systems, which play a major role in our modeling of physical phenomena at the terrestrial scale as well as at the astrophysical/cosmological scale, cannot be solved explicitly. However, using techniques such as those developed and used in this proposal, one can learn a tremendous amount of practical information about the behavior of solutions of these models, and therefore make very useful predictions regarding the behavior of the physical systems modeled by these equation systems."
0.12,"The NSF's LIGO gravitational wave detectors are among a number of new and planned facilities all over the world which are designed to directly detect and measure gravitational waves. The observation of gravitational waves will open a new window on the universe by enabling us to study exotic objects such as black holes, supernovae, neutron stars, collapsars and gamma-ray bursts. The research in this project is aimed at simulating on the computer what is expected to be one of the most important sources of gravitational radiation, namely binary systems consisting of black holes. The black holes in such systems spiral towards each other until they form a larger merged black hole. The plan for this project is to investigate these systems in order to make predictions about the gravitational waves emitted during their inspiral and merger. In the course of this work, several key physics questions will be addressed: (i) What is the maximum possible recoil velocity after the two black holes have merged? (ii) For what configurations can spin flips occur? (iii) What is the maximum achievable angular momentum of the final merged black hole? (iv) How sensitive are the simulations to the choice of the initial conditions?<br/>This work is important because gravitational wave detectors (such as LIGO) need reliable theoretical predictions of the gravitational waves which will be observed in the near future. Other aspects of this work have implications for a variety of astrophysical models. For example, the magnitude of the recoil of the final black hole is an important input parameter for the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes or the growth and retention of intermediate-mass black holes in dense stellar clusters. In addition, this investigation makes key contributions to synergistic efforts, ranging from numerical and mathematical relativity to gravitational wave astrophysics. It is carried out in collaboration with the relativity group at the University of Jena in Germany. Regular exchange with this institution through visits by faculty, post-docs and students will have educational benefits for both the students at Florida Atlantic University and the students in Jena."
0.540913,"A significant fraction of the energy in the universe has been absorbed and re-emitted by dust, in dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Most of the star formation in the universe at cosmological redshifts between 2 and 3 may have taken place in such galaxies and emitted no visible or ultraviolet light because of dust obscuration. Using the NSF- and DOE-funded South Pole Telescope (SPT), the proposing team has identified approximately 100 bright DSFGs, all of which are magnified and brightened by gravitational lensing. They now intend to use the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe these galaxies, obtaining spectroscopic redshifts, measuring elemental abundances, and inferring the distribution of dark matter. The goals are to determine the distribution of DSFGs in redshift, the physical conditions in their interstellar media, and the mass function of dark matter substructure. As a broader impact, the proposers intend to develop new interferometric analysis tools that incorporate self-calibration as a modeled uncertainty for gravitationally lensed objects. The project will support the work of two graduate students, and the PI will conduct outreach presentations and develop undergraduate laboratory exercises on interferometry."

Building on highly successful models of cosmic-scale galactic outflows, this program will focus on the environs of galaxies to better understand the complex interplay between inflows, outflows, and ambient gas in and around galactic halos. A primary goal will be to connect observable absorption-line tracers with physical properties of the gas such as kinematics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Through careful comparisons of models with available and forthcoming data, a cosmologically framed scenario will be developed for how mass, metals, and energy cycle in and out of galaxies. Implications will be investigated for how such cycling jointly establishes key properties of the inter-galactic medium and galaxies across cosmic time. Additionally, avenues will be explored for improving and optimizing the modeling of outflows on large scales within current codes, using carefully constrained test problems. Through this multi-faceted effort, the understanding of galactic outflows and their impact on galaxy properties will be greatly advanced. <br/><br/>As a part of this work Dr. Dave' will produce an educational movie on the principles of galaxy formation, with a focus on how observations and simulations work together to increase our understanding of galaxy formation. This pedagogical tool, which will be designed to be used in classrooms or viewed as a stand-alone film, will be used to help spur interest in the increasingly important subfield of extragalactic astronomy, both among teachers and the general public. In addition, Dr. Dave' will help develop and conduct an astronomy study abroad program in Ghana for advanced undergraduates from the United States and Africa.

Finding and characterizing these streams thus provides crucial information to constrain the nature of the Cold DM-predicted merging history. These streams are also highly sensitive dynamical probes constraining the shape, strength and lumpiness of the halo of the Milky Way, and provide key insights into the chemical evolution of galaxies.

0.3,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The objective of this research is to test Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation to 1% at a 100-micrometer range and to search for extra dimensions or other new physics down to a few tens of micrometers. The experiment will be cooled to liquid helium temperatures. To minimize Newtonian errors, the experiment employs a near-null source, a circular disk of large diameter-to-thickness ratio. Two test masses, also disk-shaped, are positioned on the two sides of the source mass at close proximity. As the source is driven, the differential acceleration signal across the test masses should appear at twice the drive frequency due to symmetry. The signal is detected by a superconducting differential accelerometer, which is a highly sensitive gravity sensor. <br/><br/>This research will explore the very nature of spacetime and test foundations of General Relativity and theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The observation of a deviation from Newton's law at short distance would revolutionize our understanding of gravity, could be an approach the potential experimental confirmation of string theory, and could possibly shed light on the mystifying cosmological constant problem. This sort of research is basically understandable and exciting to the public, thus stimulating their interest in fundamental science.

These dust-enshrouded galaxies are the brightest objects in the sky at submillimeter wavelengths, and are a major contributor to the cosmological density of infrared radiation. Using ancillary data from other observatories, notably the Herschel Space Telescope, the team will derive spectral energy distributions and luminosity distribution functions for an estimated 1,000 or more SMGs. Additionally the instrument will be used for measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, the distortion in the cosmic background radiation produced by hot intergalactic plasma in galaxy clusters.

0.043456,"The singularity theorems tell us that singularities form in a large class of spacetimes, including the physically relevant cases of the big bang and of the gravitational collapse of a star to form a black hole. However, these theorems tell us very little about the nature of the singularities. For example, we would like to know the entire class of incomplete observers, how the curvature behaves along their world lines and whether they can see the singularity before they hit it. Since we do not have the general solution of Einstein's equation in closed form, Prof. Garfinkle intends to use all the methods available for the study of singularities: (i) to find exact solutions and study their singularities; (ii) to prove theorems about the behavior of singular spacetimes or (iii) to perform a numerical study of spacetimes with singularities to address these issues. Numerical evolution of generic initial data for axisymmetric cosmologies will be used to study the approach to the singularity of spatially inhomogeneous models. He will examine nonsingular, stationary electrovac solutions in general relativity and in string theory. He will also explore Choptuik's numerical discovery of scaling behavior in the formation of a zero mass singularity from the collapse of a spherically scalar field using a gauge invariant null initial value formulation. Perhaps the most important problem in the study of singularities is cosmic censorship: the issue of whether singularities are hidden behind event horizons. Work by Shapiro and Teukolsky suggests that highly prolate objects can form naked singularities during gravitational collapse. As an alternative, he will start a numerical investigation of the collapse of highly prolate gravity waves to see whether a naked singularity forms."

This technology in turn is largely limited by our ability to calibrate our planet-hunting instruments. Calibration identifies spurious errors that would otherwise mimic radial motion in a stationary star.

This work will have three parts: (a) the continuation robotic searches for supernovae, extending a recently implemented technique of discovering supernovae very shortly after the explosion; (b) the acquisition, reduction, analysis, and interpretation of extensive new data (photometry and spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on improving the utility of supernovae; (c) the analysis of new and existing data concerning pre-supernovae outbursts and the nature of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae; and (d) the analysis of new and existing polarimetry data on supernovae.<br/><br/>The award will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and will support communication of the results of this project (and of supernovae in general) to the general public. The results are also expected to have broad implications for topics as diverse as the chemical evolution of galaxies, the birth rate of pulsars, the masses of black holes, the nature of gamma-ray bursts, and the expansion of the Universe."
0.699646,"Among the most important projects planned for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be the measurement of the cosmological effects of dark energy. These effects will be detected through their influence on the growth of structure in the early universe and on weak gravitational lensing by galaxies and galaxy clusters. In order for these efforts to succeed, studies of the potential sources of error should begin now. The LSST survey, expected to comprise of order 1 billion galaxies, will have such small statistical errors that systematic errors - the most important being in the measurement of photometric redshift and weak gravitational lens shear - may dominate. In this project, the proposing team will carry out a comprehensive study of the origin and impact of these systematic effects in dark energy measurements, and develop algorithms, analysis tools and observing techniques to minimize their impact. They will use the improved understanding of the residual systematics to simulate the performance of LSST, as a precursor to construction. They have previously found that dark energy constraints are sensitive to systematics in ways that depend strongly on how separate techniques (such as weak lensing, cosmic shear, and baryon acoustic oscillations) are combined. The team intends to exploit this sensitivity and investigate new methods for controlling systematic error by combining several observational probes in an optimal way. They will use end-to- end simulations of LSST to develop and test these algorithms, and apply them to the current data from the Deep Lens Survey (DLS) to produce science in the near term. The team intends to make its techniques, data, and open-source software publicly available with no proprietary period, with the expectation that their photometric redshift algorithm will be widely used. In addition to contributing to education through the mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher, the project will also engage in public outreach and informal education by partnering in the development of new tools to visualize the dark and luminous structure of the Universe."
0.930881,"This project centers on optical (visible-light) observations using large, ground-based telescopes, designed to maximally exploit the science return from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT, an NSF-funded experiment at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, consists of a 10-meter diameter, millimeter-wave radio telescope designed to measure the subtle fluctuations in the brightness of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at multiple wavelengths. As part of its survey operations, the SPT is producing a list of possible galaxy clusters detected by the effect the hot, intra-cluster plasma has on the CBR. The size of this spectral distortion, known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, is independent of distance, offering the opportunity to inventory galaxy clusters in the universe, relatively free of the strong distance bias that affects other types of observations. In this project the collaborating team (from Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Harvard University) will perform optical follow-up observations of the SPT cluster candidates, to confirm the existence of the clusters, to obtain their redshifts, and to identify the member galaxies. The team will make use of an array of existing instrumentation on the current suite of large telescopes, including PISCO, a multi-bandpass imaging camera developed with NSF support for the 6.5-meter Magellan telescope. The primary result of this work will be an unprecedented, volume-limited catalog of approximately 600 galaxy clusters. The full catalog of photometric and spectroscopic observations will be released to the astronomical community through a web-accessible archive using well-developed database architectures. These observations are intended to enable a wide variety of subsequent inquiries, including studies of galaxy evolution in different environments, efforts to further constrain cosmological parameters, and cluster mass measurements through gravitational lensing. The project will support the work of a postdoctoral fellow, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, and will be publicized through the Principal Investigators' close involvement with significant public-media projects."
0.04705,"AST-1009544/1008330/1009113<br/>Pitman/Hofmeister/Speck<br/><br/>Understanding the nature and formation of cosmic dust is crucial to our understanding of the Universe. The absorption, scattering, and re-emission of light by cosmic dust has a profound effect on the interpretation of observed spectral signatures and radiative transfer processes in a variety of astronomical objects. Dust is crucial to star formation processes, and understanding the dust at high redshift is vital to cosmological models and dark energy studies. To account properly for energy budgets in astrophysical environments requires an understanding of the physical properties of the dust, gained from several types of laboratory data: (1) absorbance spectra, which can be compared to observational spectra, and (2) reflectivity spectra, which may be used to derive (3) optical functions. However, quality laboratory data are not available for many of the compounds believed to exist in space, particularly at ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) wavelengths. This project will provide all three forms of UV-vis laboratory data for a suite of solid-state materials found in meteorites and in the condensation sequence. The major goals are: (1) Determine the spectral behavior of selected silicates, sulfides, oxides, glasses, and other materials that may be present in space; (2) Determine optical functions for these materials; and (3) Apply these data to outstanding questions in astronomy, and make all of the data available to the astronomical community.<br/><br/>This research will broaden the participation of under-represented groups and enhance the infrastructure for research and education. The synergistic, cross-disciplinary study involves scientists in astrophysics, mineral physics, and planetary science, using laboratory, observational, and theoretical modeling techniques. Laboratory fundamental research for astrophysics is at a critical stage and this work will train new U.S. researchers and students in this area, matching personnel with underutilized but available equipment. The female lead researchers are all strong role models for women in science, and have strong histories of public outreach and active mentorship of undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students."
0.150397,"The likely detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources will open a new window for astronomy and provide new tests of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Interpreting the observations and advancing this new field will require accurate theoretical predictions for the wave signal from a given source. This project will make use of a method known as Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE), that has been developed by the PI and his students at Washington University, which solves Einstein's equations systematically in a procedure known as the post-Newtonian approximation (appropriate for systems where the velocities are small compared to the speed of light). Using this method, it will be possible to study the detailed motion and radiation from the inspiral of compact binary systems (double star systems containing neutron stars or black holes) to a high degree of accuracy. Post-Newtonian methods will also be used to study unusual aspects of the curved spacetime surrounding rotating black holes, related to the existence of the so-called ""Carter"" constant of the motion, and to calculate the recoil velocity experienced by black holes formed from compact binary merger. Ways to use gravitational-wave data to test alternative theories of gravity in new regimes and to measure astrophysical and cosmological parameters will also be studied. In particular, a detailed analysis of gravitational radiation from compact binary inspiral in a class of ""scalar-tensor"" alternatives to general relativity will be carried out, together with a study of data analysis strategies for placing the best possible bound on this class of theories. The possibility of testing general relativity in the strong-field vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy using future adaptive optics infrared interferometry will be analyzed by studying orbital perturbations of stars in close orbits near the hole caused by other stars in the central region, by a possible distribution of dark matter, and by tidal distortions of the stars. This will involve a mixture of analytical post-Newtonian calculations and numerical N- body simulations.<br/><br/>The work on equations of motion, gravitational waveforms and analysis of gravitational-wave data will impact the emerging field of gravitational-wave astronomy. The work on recoil velocities may contribute important insights that could impact astrophysical modeling of the growth of massive black holes in galaxies, as well as the interface between post-Newtonian theory and numerical relativity. The work on testing general relativity near the galactic center black hole could impact the development of advanced instrumentation for observational infrared astronomy. Education and training of students will be integrated into the research program."
0.2367,"The Washington University group, will extend its studies of the potentially observable consequences of the general theory of relativity, in experimental, astrophysical and cosmological contexts. The effects of gravitational emission and damping in binary systems of compact objects will be analyzed, as possible sources of detectable gravitational radiation and as potential tests of alternative theories of gravity. A study of the normal modes of oscillation of black holes will continue, with emphasis on high-overtone modes, and on modes of rotating black holes. The observable effects of light scalar fields, that could arise in field theories of particles and their interactions, are being analyzed with a view to obtaining constraints on their properties using tests of the ""fifth force"" and other gravitational experiments."
0.289653,"Despite significant advances in recent decades in our understanding of the evolution and internal structure of stars, many aspects of theory remain untested or have been shown to disagree with observations. Evolutionary models are widely used by astronomers to infer various properties of stars such as their masses, ages, or metallicities, but our confidence in these models is limited to some extent by those disagreements and by a lack of observational constraints. The validation of theory is best made through a detailed comparison with accurate measurements of quantities such as the stellar mass, the radius, the effective temperatures, or the luminosities, of stars in carefully selected binary systems of known chemical composition. However these determinations are not trivial to make with the required precision. In this project, high quality spectroscopic, photometric, or astrometric observations are being obtained and analyzed to make the determinations of the absolute stellar properties with relative errors, in the case of the masses and radii, at the current state-of-the-art, and to perform ""critical tests"" of stellar evolution theory. More than that, the goal is to provide so many observational constraints for a given binary system that only the most realistic sets of models (if any) may satisfy all the observations within the errors. Key binary systems are being identified that provide the best tests of the models, with particular emphasis on low-mass stars, evolved stars and very young (pre-main-sequence) stars for which virtually no constraints are available, as well as on stars with chemical compositions very different from the Sun (metal-poor).<br/><br/>Broader Impact. This project is advancing our understanding of several poorly known areas of stellar astrophysics such as convection (mixing length theory, overshooting), internal structure, stellar rotation, mass loss, and tidal evolution, allowing much more reliable determinations of parameters such as the ages of stars. These stellar parameters have profound cosmological implications and provide a more solid framework for the study of the origin and evolution of substellar objects such as brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets, subjects of great interest for the public and scientists alike. The dissemination of the results to the scientific community, mainly in the form of peer-reviewed publications, is an integral part of this work. It provides excellent opportunities for training by integrating front-line research into the experience of learning, allowing students to actively participate in all aspects of the study of crucial binary systems."
1.990546,"The proposed research involves group research in Particle, Fields and Strings. The group proposes to explore physics beyond the standard model with an eye on understanding two important fine-tuning problems, the hierarchy problem (why are the masses of the particles very different (much lighter) than the Planck mass) and the cosmological constant problem. In the context of higher dimensions, the hierarchy problem becomes why are the extra dimensions so large? The PI's intend to explore discretized extra dimensions as a method of constructing new classes of field theories using the principle of deconstruction. This is an entirely new method of model building. As an alternative to Supersymmetry and its inherent doubling of the spectrum of particles being the relevant physics expected at new colliders such as LHC, the PI's are exploring a qualitatively new approach to the hierarchy problem based on having a light Higgs that is a pseudo-Goldstone Boson. This approach is called the ""little Higgs"" model and it has new predictions for TeV Physics. The PI's intend to continue their exploration of duality symmetries as well as the geometric engineering of quantum field theories using string geometry."
0.085,"The proposed research covers the fields of gravitational physics, Quantum Fields and String Theory. The PI proposes to use cosmic ray data that will soon be available to see if TeV scale gravity is a viable theory. If so he intends to extract information about the extra dimensions, as well as the Hawking temperature from the data. The PI hopes to improve on the current semi-classical theory of Black Hole formation and evaporation. In this vein, he intends to investigate whether the black hole formation can be extracted from current ideas from string theory concerning D-brane collapse. The PI also intends to study antisymmetric tensor fields in four dimensions as well as solitons in N=2 gauge theories. Finally the PI hopes to extend to string theory language the idea that the smallness of the cosmological constant might be due to the instability of de Sitter space due to particle production."
0.345485,"This work will use asteroseismic data of stellar pulsations to test models of stellar evolution. As part of this effort, Dr. Basu and a postdoctoral associate will test whether the internal structure and underlying physics of the most stellar evolution theory is correct. Dr. Basu will also use asteroseismology data to obtain masses, radii, effective temperatures, helium abundances, log g(surface gravity) and convection zone sizes in stars. In particular, her team will use data on the large separation and frequency of maximum oscillation for numerous stars provided by the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium to determine how gross properties of the models should vary across the HR diagram. <br/><br/>This work will extend well beyond stellar astrophysics because stars are used to calibrate both time and distance scales in the Universe and if the stellar models are incorrect, this would have many cosmological implications. This will also involve the training of a postdoctoral research associate."

Data from the LHC is likely to lead to nothing less than a new Standard Model for the next generation of particle physicists, describing the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at an even higher energy scale. In his research, Professor Anchordoqui aims to develop methods by which a certain class of new theories beyond the Standard Model might be tested at the LHC. This class of new theories includes those in which the myriad of particle types in the Standard Model is replaced by a single fundamental building block: a ""string."" One critical component of Anchordoqui's work is to explore the various properties of string resonances related to experimental searches for new physics at the LHC. He is also involved in complementary cosmological and astrophysical observations, which aid his search for string theory's smoking gun and help unravel the mysteries of the Universe's unseen dimensions.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Anchordoqui will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results and develop new course curricula based on results from the LHC."
0.031452,"This project seeks answers to several pressing questions about the formation and evolution of galaxies. It does so by using the Blue Waters supercomputer to perform a suite of sophisticated supercomputer simulations. The investigators will address such questions as: (i) How did the earliest progenitors of the Milky Way galaxy form, and where can we find their stellar remnants today? (ii) How does the ionizing radiation produced by massive stars escape from galaxies, and how does it affect the properties of neighboring galaxies? (iii) How does the gas that is critical for star formation get from the cosmic web into the central regions of galaxies, and how is gas returned to the intergalactic medium? (iv) How are magnetic fields seeded and amplified in galaxies, and how are they ejected into (or amplified in) the intergalactic medium?<br/>The team includes experts in astrophysics as well as in high performance computing, and is united in the use of a sophisticated numerical tool (the Enzo AMR code) that has already demonstrated its performance on Blue Waters. The team will work with observational astronomer collaborators to apply these simulations to the interpretation of measurements of both local and distant galaxies from current astronomical surveys, and to motivate future observations by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.<br/>The proposed work promises to have significant impact on scientists in training, who will learn to use cutting-edge numerical tools at the largest possible scale. The project will involve undergraduate students at Michigan State University (through MSU?s REU program, which targets women and under-represented minorities) and postdoctoral researchers in the research efforts. Scientific results from this program will be visualized by staff at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and will be disseminated to the public via pre-existing collaborations with planetaria and museums, and via the Internet. In addition, these visualizations will be used as part of outreach talks given by members of this project. Finally, the simulation data produced as a result of this project will be used in computational science courses at Michigan State University, where it will be used to train students in scientific visualization and data analysis techniques. The resulting curricular materials will be made available to the public via the World Wide Web.<br/><br/><br/>The specific research methods used in this project include the creation of an extensive library of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies and their environments that can be used to explore a wide range of observable astrophysical phenomena. This will be the first study to perform cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution that include self-consistent treatments of radiation transport and/or magnetohydrodynamics for a statistically significant number of galaxies, and to apply these calculations to the interpretation of recent observations relating to the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium, galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, and high redshift galaxy formation. Furthermore, the simulation data produced during the course of this project, as well as a wide range of data products, will be made publicly available via the nascent National Data Service. This data will be usable by the astrophysical research community, and will enable researchers to address a much broader range of questions regarding galaxy formation and evolution than can be done as a part of this project alone, thus leveraging the computational resources available on Blue Waters."

He plans to study astrophysical shock waves modeling explosions, which are based upon matching of certain solutions of Einstein's equations across a shock-wave interface. Such shock wave solutions model stellar formation, and are related to a variety of astrophysical phenomena. The PI also plans to study, (together with A. Wasserman), certain solutions of the EYM equations modeling both black holes, and elementary particles. In particular, the black hole solutions are related to Hawking radiation of black holes.

0.4,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), slated to begin taking data in 2008, will engage a new energy frontier. However, there is great uncertainty as to what exactly will be seen. Nonetheless, there are strong indications that its discoveries will address fundamental questions. This proposal will leverage the data from this ambitious undertaking and other experiments to primarily explore two questions: What is the identity of the mysterious dark matter that permeates our universe? What is the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking? Disentangling the answers to these questions will be a decade-long program requiring cooperation between theorists and experimentalists. The PI has several particular focuses. One initial focus will be to examining exotic new physics signatures. As more data arrives, the emphasis will shift towards building models that answer these two fundamental questions in a way consistent with data. Deciphering these questions will require an understanding of not only particle physics data, but data from cosmological experiments. Taking advantage of the interplay between the celestial and terrestrial will allow the PI to gain additional insight into the fundamental questions he intends to explore. <br/>Another goal of this proposal is to ensure that the knowledge and excitement generated by current and upcoming discoveries in particle physics are broadly shared: from the general public through graduate students. The outreach effort under this proposal will be two-fold. First, an exhibit on particle physics and the LHC is planned at the Ruthven Exhibit Museum for Natural History in Ann Arbor. This exhibit should reach 20- 30 thousand visitors during its initial run, including over 10,000 school-age students, many from disadvantaged areas.

(ii) What is the fraction of halo stars stripped off globular clusters? (iii) Was the bulge assembled by early mergers or by gradual transformation of the Galactic disk? <br/><br/>They will implement the cluster formation and evolution model in the cosmological adaptive-mesh-refinement code (called ART) and run several realizations of Milky Way-sized galaxies with different environment and merger history. ART is a powerful galaxy formation code and already includes non-equilibrium cooling and heating of cosmic gas, non-equilibrium formation and dissociation of molecular hydrogen, thermal, kinetic, and radiative feedback of young stars, transport of ionizing radiation, and other important processes. Inclusion of clustered star formation will add a realistic description of stellar populations, with a well-defined stellar initial mass function and more concentrated feedback on the interstellar medium (ISM). The simulations will produce a rich data model, and will be used to interpret various observations of Galactic clusters and dwarf satellites.<br/><br/>They will integrate the simulations into a program of state-of-the-art scientific visualizations of galaxy formation over cosmic time.

0.1249,"Researchers have shown that different cultural groups, exploiting a common environment, have very different cognitive models of animal-plant-human interactions, and that these mental models are strongly correlated with, and perhaps cause strikingly different environmental behaviors. This research focuses on how different Lowland Maya cultural groups respond across generations to conditions of radical change, including language loss, environmental degradation, spatial displacement and dislocation. The project studies the mental models of the environment, and the values and behaviors associated with environmental and health-related decision making, of Lowland Maya people in the Guatemalan Department of El Peten. The research will document similarities and differences in folk-ecological models, environmental values and behaviors within and across cultures; will examine the flow of information within and across Indian and Ladino (Mestizo) groups; and will determine how relations between cognitive models and their transmission promote or undermine successful solutions to resource dilemmas and related conflicts. The research will study how Lowland Maya notions of illness are embedded and sustained within a vestigial cosmological framework of relationships involving humans, spirits and the surrounding social and material environment; and will contribute to a reliable cross-cultural methodology for understanding folk mental models of illness and behaviors that result from them.<br/><br/>Methods include experiments that integrate modeling techniques from anthropology, psychology, sociology and market research including the cultural-consensus model, mental models and social network models. The research is designed to assess within and between-population agreement on knowledge of plants, including principles of classification, on values, and on types of causal reasoning that drive decisions about how to tend the environment and treat human health disorders. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the new knowledge to be created relate to environmental planners and decision makers who deal with ""the Tragedy of the Commons"" and related social dilemmas pertaining to resource use.

0.1188,"9306240 Raymond Frank Raymond has refined a theory for generalized Seifert fiberings modelled on principal G-bundles to include arbitrary Lie groups G. Applications and examples illustrating how the general theory differs from the case where G is abelian or nilpotent have been developed and will be put into final form. Techniques and results from Seifert fiberings will be used to investigate space form problems for the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature and their frame bundles. Elliptic surfaces whose Euler characteristic are zero support 4-dimensional geometries. A Teichmueller theory for these geometries and the moduli of isometry classes will be constructed and determined. G. Peter Scott plans to work in three main areas: Firstly, he will continue his work on the topological rigidity of 3-manifolds. Secondly, he plans to work in the area of 3-dimensional Poincare duality groups. The long term aim here is to show that any such group comes from a 3-manifold, but he will restrict his attention to those groups which 'ought' to correspond to Seifert fiber spaces or to Haken manifolds. Thirdly, he plans to extend to higher dimensions his work generating the characteristic submanifold of a 3-manifold. Manifolds are natural geometric objects like circles and spheres and doughnuts that can be described locally by the same type of coordinates as a Euclidean space of the same dimension. Their variety and complexity increases rapidly as the dimension increases, but some of the most intractable problems arise already in dimensions three and four. That we live in a world of three dimensions, or four if time is considered, makes this of more than purely academic interest. Cosmologists do not know which 3- or 4-manifold constitutes the physical universe, so studying the possibilities that can occur has ample motivation. These two investigators are making ingenious use of geometry and of algebra to shed light on the question. Their work w ill also enrich the arsenal of tools available to others for studying low-dimensional manifolds. ***"
0.006189,"This research project examines the relationship between sorcery beliefs and practices and other modes of processing interpersonal disputes in communities on Siquijor Island, the Philippines. The student aims to delineate the cultural values and cosmological beliefs which affect interpersonal conflict and conflict resolution and to analyze the role which sorcery plays in the mediation of conflicts. He will test the hypothesis that sorcery is chosen as a mode of dispute processing when mediation is unsuccessful. This research will contribute to our knowledge of sorcery and religion, dispute processing, social relations, and interpersonal conflict in the Philippines. While sorcery is often characterized as an illegitimate or pathological form of social control, this research will show that it is part of a larger system of values that make the world comprehensible to its inhabitants. This research will uniquely advance our understanding of Philippine social relations. Social relationships are determined by considerations of conflict as much as by positive goals such as social reciprocity and companionship. Because this project will focus on conflict- causing issues, the means used to process disputes, and the consequences of conflicts, it will shed light on the relationship between conflict and the structuring of social behavior."

2.1,"We propose a new framework to enhance the quality of scientific computational research in the fields of chemistry, astronomy, and neurobiology. We make an analogy with demand-driven, portal-based online knowledge systems, such as Google Search, Wolfram|Alpha, Expedia and Orbitz. For example, travelers in the recent past relied heavily on travel agents who manipulated complicated flight databases and booking protocols. Nowadays customers can perform searches and make reservations on their own via the web using a simple online interface without any specialized knowledge such as hotel logistics or airport codes. One of the greatest advantages is the freedom to explore the information space autonomously, potentially finding many more travel options, increasing overall competition and quality of results.<br/><br/>In our analogy, the application scientist is the traveler and the computer expert is the travel agent. Scientific computation is an accepted third pillar of scientific discovery, alongside traditional experiment and pen-and-paper theory. However, it is very often restricted to a cadre of specialists who have mastered the knowledge of utilizing complicated software tools and hardware, despite massive investment in world-class high-performance computing (HPC) facilities. Successful scientists who lack these computer skills face a semantic gap impeding their potential. Our ultimate vision is to democratize the exploitation of these valuable HPC resources to a broader range of application scientists, inspired by the success of portal-based online services which abstract-away the technical details of a computer platform without sacrificing functionality. Our system will provide access to simulation and data-processing packages on HPC hardware, and facilitate the imaging and visualization of complex data sets. Moreover, a natural-language interface and expert system, based around the Wolfram|Alpha approach, will help to guide productive inquiry and interpretation of results. The selected drivers are: (1) quantum chemistry simulation of thousands of molecules, including the search for advanced materials; (2) imaging massive cosmological datasets from radio telescopes; (3) analysis of high-resolution electron microscope brain images in computational neurobiology.<br/><br/>We envisage a broad impact of the work not only in many areas of fundamental research, but also in education. The program will be integrated into courses offered at Harvard and its Extension School, and outreach to minorities and the underprivileged will be accomplished through established mechanisms at the University. The portal format, coupled with an online database of historical results, naturally enables dissemination of research products and offers an ideal platform for training events and workshops."

Although there is currently little doubt that dark energy represents some new and fundamental physics, there is still a need to distinguish between various possibilities for its nature: is it gravitational, residing in Einstein's cosmological constant, or exotic matter, coming from quantum mechanical processes in the vacuum? This project continues an ambitious survey, currently about half complete, to use some 200 Type Ia supernovae between redshifts of 0.2 and 0.8 to map out the expansion history of the Universe. It should be able to constrain a critical dark energy parameter with a fractional uncertainty of only 10%.<br/><br/>Many undergraduate and graduate students have been involved in this cutting-edge research project, and the enhanced capabilities it required at an NSF-supported telescope have benefited all users of that facility.

Small fluctuations present in the very early universe have grown under the influence of gravity and other forces to form all the stars, galaxies, superclusters, etc. that we see around us today. Dr. Cohn will be investigating structure formation by concentrating on the properties of dark matter halos, that is, clustered dark matter.<br/><br/>Dr. Cohn will study profiles of dark matter by using data from observed strong gravitational lens systems in the case where the lens is a galaxy. In strong gravitational lensing, the mass of the galaxy has bent the light approaching us from a more distant source so much that we see multiple images of the source. The positions and brightness of the multiple images of the source depend in part on how matter is distributed in the lensing galaxy, and thus these positions and fluxes can be analyzed to find the dark matter structure of the galaxy. The collection of discovered lenses will be used to build up a statistical sample of mass profiles present in the universe at different eras and environments. In addition, if the source varies with time, the images will vary as well.

0.245852,"This award funds work to obtain and analyze X-ray, optical, infrared, millimeter and radio wavelength observations to study the explosion properties of short-lived Gamma Ray Burst emission (GRBs). GRBs are mysterious, transient highly energetic phenomena (significantly brighter than supernova explosions) that may be caused by the merger of binaries composed of neutron stars and/or a black hole. The investigators also plan to use the GRBs from very distant sources as 'flashlights' to illuminate foreground galaxies and intergalactic medium. The measurements will be used to measure the chemical enrichment of galaxies, and to constrain models of the Epoch of Re-ionization (EoR), which plays a dominant role in cosmological models. The EoR occurred when the universe was only a few hundred million years old, and marks the transition from when the universe's gaseous component changed from mostly neutral to mostly ionized. The researchers will integrate astronomy research into undergraduate courses, train and mentor students and post-doctoral fellows, and conduct public outreach. <br/><br/>This work will be accomplished by focusing on three main goals using a variety of telescopes, including the JVLA, CARMA, ALMA, Magellan, Chandra and Gemini. The investigators will: 1) determine the composition of the GRB ejecta (baryonic vs. magnetic) in the first few hours to days after a burst is detected; 2) measure the jet opening angles of short GRBs to determine the energy scale and rate, search for r-process powered counterparts to test models that predict that GRBs are generated from compact object binaries; and 3) use GRB emission to measure galaxy metallicities and reionization at redshifts that are inaccessible to direct observations, and to study the mass-metallicity relation at z = 2 - 5."

This research will extend our knowledge of the distribution of very distant galaxies to a very large degree, approximately doubling the number of redshifts available for the construction and testing of cosmological models. This program, to be carried out by members of the group which first discovered very large scale inhomogeneities in the uni- verse, builds on work supported under a previous NSF grant in the form of a multi-object fiber system which permits obtaining thirty or more good spectra of galaxies in only two hours.

0.098223,"9704155 Hunter The proposal is to study a number of nonlinear partial differential equations which model various physical and biological systems. The first equation is a free-boundary value problem which models the deposition of surfactant on a surface by a liquid droplet. There is a complex interaction between the motion of the droplet on the surface and the deposition of surfactant. The second equation is a system of reaction-diffusion equations which models an islet of beta-cells in the pancreas. The aim of Professor Hunter's research is to understand the collective dynamics of the beta-cells and the formation of spatial patterns in an islet. The third equation is a two dimensional Burgers equation which models the diffraction and reflection of weak shock waves in two space dimensions, where there are longstanding discrepancies between theory and experiment. The fourth equation is a modulation equation which describes the propagation of nonlinear gravitational waves in Einstein's theory of general relativity. Professor Hunter proposes to study this equation with the aim of understanding the formation of space-time singularities in a nonlinear gravitational wave. Mathematical models of physical and biological systems provide a way to understand, predict, and control the behavior of those systems. The proposed research involves the study of a number of mathematical models of systems of importance in engineering, biology, and basic science. One model describes the deposition of surfactant on a surface by droplets. Surface deposition has many applications in materials science, including the printing of very small structures on surfaces for the control of fluids, and as an experimental means of preparing liquid crystal display screens. A second model describes the collective behavior of beta-cells in the pancreas. These cells produce insulin and play a central role in diseases like diabetes. A third model describes the propagation of shock waves, which are generated by transonic or supersonic aircraft, in turbines, and in many other high-speed fluid flows. The mathematical theory of shock waves remains very poorly understood. The fourth model is a set of equations which describe the propagation of nonlinear gravitational waves in Einstein's general theory of relativity. The general theory of relativity is the fundamental physical theory of gravity, and it describes the large scale cosmological structure of the universe. The main obstacle to understanding the predictions of the theory is the nonlinearity of the Einstein equations. This work is directed towards an increased understanding of the effects of this nonlinearity."

The absorption, scattering, and re-emission of light by cosmic dust has a profound effect on the interpretation of observed spectral signatures and radiative transfer processes in a variety of astronomical objects. Dust is crucial to star formation processes, and understanding the dust at high redshift is vital to cosmological models and dark energy studies. To account properly for energy budgets in astrophysical environments requires an understanding of the physical properties of the dust, gained from several types of laboratory data: (1) absorbance spectra, which can be compared to observational spectra, and (2) reflectivity spectra, which may be used to derive (3) optical functions. However, quality laboratory data are not available for many of the compounds believed to exist in space, particularly at ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) wavelengths. This project will provide all three forms of UV-vis laboratory data for a suite of solid-state materials found in meteorites and in the condensation sequence. The major goals are: (1) Determine the spectral behavior of selected silicates, sulfides, oxides, glasses, and other materials that may be present in space; (2) Determine optical functions for these materials; and (3) Apply these data to outstanding questions in astronomy, and make all of the data available to the astronomical community.<br/><br/>This research will broaden the participation of under-represented groups and enhance the infrastructure for research and education. The synergistic, cross-disciplinary study involves scientists in astrophysics, mineral physics, and planetary science, using laboratory, observational, and theoretical modeling techniques. Laboratory fundamental research for astrophysics is at a critical stage and this work will train new U.S. researchers and students in this area, matching personnel with underutilized but available equipment.

It also addresses problems in<br/>incompressible fluid mechanics and general relativity, and applies the<br/>results to a variety of important physical problems. A common theme of<br/>much of the proposed work is how nonlinearity leads to the formation<br/>and propagation of various kinds of singularities, such as shock waves<br/>in compressible fluids, or space-time singularities in general<br/>relativity. Specific topics proposed for study are the following:<br/>shock wave reflection; shock wave propagation in random media;<br/>nonlinear hyperbolic surface waves in elasticity and<br/>magnetohydrodynamics; the Prandtl boundary layer equations and<br/>vorticity wave, mean flow interactions in incompressible fluid<br/>mechanics; and the effect of nonlinearity on gravitational waves in<br/>general relativity.<br/><br/>Waves (such as sound waves, seismic waves, light waves, quantum<br/>mechanical waves,or gravitational waves) are a central feature of many<br/>physical systems, from the atomic to the cosmological scales. At lower<br/>intensities, waves superpose and they may be described by linear<br/>theories, but at higher intensities nonlinear effects becomes<br/>significant, leading to qualitatively new phenomena (like shock waves<br/>and solitons).

0.424333,"The proposal seeks funding to begin a research effort on characterizing and extracting galactic dust emissions from the data that will be collected by the NASA-funded Antarctic Long Duration Balloon-borne (LDB) ?E and B Experiment? (EBEX). A leading cosmological paradigm for the beginning and evolution of the Universe posits a period of Inflation shortly after the Big Bang. Inflation generated primordial gravitational waves in the Universe that imprinted a distinct signature called the ""B-mode signal"" on the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. This signal is extremely weak, around 100 microKelvins or smaller, and astrophysical foregrounds such as polarized emission from galactic dust and synchrotron radiation swamp the Inflationary signal over most of the sky. The EBEX balloon payload will have the sensitivity to detect the B-mode signal if it is stronger than 1/10 of the current theoretical upper limit. The balloon observations will be carried out in frequency bands between 150 and 410 GHz. The higher end of this band is not accessible from the ground; thus, EBEX can provide valuable information on the properties of galactic dust emissions. This information is critical for all the CMB experiments searching for the Inflationary signal. EBEX is currently awaiting its flight from Antarctica in the austral summer of 2010/2011. The requested funds will be used to support a post-doctoral fellow and a graduate student to work on the characterization and extraction of galactic dust foregrounds from the EBEX data."

0.089,"Rukmani Vijayaraghavan is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Virginia. Galaxies in dense groups and clusters, unlike ordinary field galaxies like the Milky Way, are subject to extreme astrophysical processes that remove their gas and shut down star formation. These processes are far from gentle; many galaxies go through a violent evolutionary phase before settling into their eventual passive gas-poor states. During this phase, star formation and supermassive black hole activity within galaxies can be triggered by strong pressure in the ambient gas. Energy injected by these stars and supermassive black holes can in turn replenish gas lost from galaxies, further continuing this cycle. These processes, mysteriously, operate in the presence of other mechanisms in dense environments that should destroy galactic gas. While there is abundant observational evidence that these processes operate in cluster galaxies, a theoretical understanding of the physics driving the energy cycle in group and cluster galaxies remains elusive. Vijayaraghavan will exploit recent advances in computing and astrophysical software development to carry out a simulations-based investigation into these extreme astrophysical phenomena. She will also run an educational program to promote enthusiasm for computational astrophysics in middle-school-aged girl students. These students will be exposed to the latest scientific developments and techniques in modern astrophysics through computer- and telescope-based activities.<br/><br/>Solving the problem of galaxy evolution in cluster environments requires modeling and disentangling the contribution of multiple simultaneous complex physical phenomena, operating over six orders of magnitude in physical scale. Vijayaraghavan will perform a series of supercomputer simulations using the FLASH code to progressively incorporate multiple physics modules, and use adaptive mesh refinement to focus computational resources on interesting regions. In these simulations, cosmologically realistic red and blue galaxies, including their stellar and gas components, will be allowed to evolve within massive group and cluster environments in the presence of progressively complex physical processes. Based on these simulations, Vijayaraghavan will identify and disentangle the physical mechanisms triggering star formation and black hole activity in cluster galaxies, and investigate the impacts of these processes on cluster galaxy evolution. She will also generate mock observations from simulations to directly compare with radio, optical, and X-ray observations of the hot and cold gas, star formation, and black hole activity in cluster galaxies. This project will use supercomputing resources at the University of Virginia and NSF XSEDE supercomputers. The educational component of this program will be based around summer day camps, where girls will gain an understanding of modern astrophysics through a combination of interactive presentations and hands-on experience with computers and observatory telescopes. The object of these camps will be to inspire girls to pursue careers in STEM fields."

As part of the original acquisition under solicitation 05-525, Kraken is being upgraded to over 99K cores and over 1 petaflop/s of peak performance. With this memory upgrade, which increases 3,840 nodes from 8 GB to 16 GB, all 8,256 nodes will have 16 GB of memory for an aggregate of 132 TB of memory. This uniform configuration will allow researchers to efficiently utilize the entire system for a single application and will add flexibility in scheduling all applications on Kraken. For the most scalable applications that require 16 GB/node, the additional memory will effectively double the size of the largest jobs on the highest performance system in the NSF portfolio.<br/><br/>This memory upgrade will allow users to run simulations at higher resolution by running at larger scale, increase the fidelity of their simulations by allowing for the incorporation of additional physical processes and/or variables, and allow applications that are limited by their total amount of memory to run on fewer nodes. Many large scale computational science applications are limited by the amount of physical memory available on a node and computational researchers expect to increase their memory requirements as the scale of the computations increase. Increasing the amount of available memory will greatly increase the flexibility in running more advanced multi-scale and multi-component applications, including applications such as multidimensional supernova simulations using CHIMERA, astrophysical and cosmological structure formation with ENZO, nanoscale electronics with OMEN, seismic hazard research with the Anelastic Wave Propagation code (AWP-Olsen), and computational chemistry with NWChem and MADNESS. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this memory enhancement include support for education and outreach via university classes and laboratory workshops at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, and at Morehouse College and Claflin College.

ADMX as ""one experiment, two sites"" will thus be able to pursue a two-prong strategy, simultaneously pushing downwards in the axion-photon coupling and upwards in mass.<br/><br/>In Broader Impacts, ADMX has already proven to be a driver of leading-edge technology; NSF supported the development of the near-quantum limited SQUID amplifiers for ADMX more than a decade ago, which quickly spun off to become a critical piece of IARPA's (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) roadmap in quantum computing. ADMX-HF can similarly be expected to draw from the deep quantum electronics competency at Yale to provide new innovations benefiting basic science and security. The PI has a long history of employing undergraduates to work on his research."
0.2201,"Gaffney, Le and Massey will continue their study of the singularities of complex analytic spaces and mappings. Gaffney will investigate the equisingularity of families of mappings using analytic invariants, extending his results to C- zero finitely determined germs, and he will continue to develop an infinitesimal theory of Whitney equisingularity using integral closure operations. With Massey, he will investigate the correct generalizations of the Le cycles to the complete intersection case. Using blowing up operations, he will study the topology of maps between low dimensional spaces. Le will investigate the relation between algebraic depth and rectified homotopical depth, continuing his study of Lefschetz type theorems for singular spaces. Le also plans to give a new proof of the Le-Ramanujam theorem using vector fields, and he plans to study the canonical decomposition of the local monodromy of complex hypersurfaces and its links with the resolution of singularities and the geometry of polars. Massey will investigate questions concerning a topologically invariant decomposition of a constructible function, the Euler characteristic of the Milnor fibre of f-f(p) at p, and the related question of how the sheaf of vanishing cycles of a map decomposes as a perverse sheaf. The machinery of the derived category should allow for a powerful attack on the structure of non-isolated hypersurface singularities. Understanding singular spaces is important for realistic models of physical phenomena. Perhaps the most widely known singularity is the cosmologists' ""big bang."""
0.125646,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>This project is concerned with a variety of problems related to the construction of normal forms and their various applications to well-posedness of solutions and perturbation theory for classes of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations. It also explores potential applications of these ideas to the dynamics and the spectral geometry of a class of integrable billiard systems. More specifically, it is proposed to study the focusing and defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. The principal investigator aims to construct various normal forms for these equations in the phase space of square-integrable, 1-periodic functions and in certain spaces of distributions. The analysis of the corresponding frequency maps would eventually lead to new well-posedness results and to various applications to perturbation theory. The principal investigator proposes to establish spectral rigidity of a class of Riemannian manifolds with boundary (known as ""Liouville billiard tables"") by introducing new techniques involving quasimodes and a generalization of the Radon transform. The dynamical properties of the corresponding discrete billiard system will play a crucial role in the proof of the claimed spectral rigidity. <br/><br/>The scope of the project lies in the development of new methods coming from the theory of Hamiltonian systems to fundamental problems in analysis, geometry, and the theory of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations. Many of the results obtained by these methods cannot be obtained by the traditional and more general methods for solving such equations. Beyond applications to well-posedness and perturbation theory, normal forms provide a very detailed description of the solutions via so-called Birkhoff coordinates. The proposed activity would lead to a better understanding of the dynamics and the stability properties of the solutions of a class of nonlinear evolution equations that arise in various physical systems such as water waves, plasma physics, solid-state physics, nonlinear optics, and fluid mechanics. Recent applications of the activity include new results in statistical mechanics (preservation of white noise) and applications to astrophysics, namely, the problem of studying light rays moving on black hole backgrounds in the presence of a cosmological constant."

0.5575,"Advancing our understanding in a wide range of scientific and engineering fields require the solution of the fluid equations over a very large range of densities and physical scales. These problems, which are not soluble on the current generation of computers, can be solved with the new generation of massively parallel high performance computers using object oriented languages and are likely to form one of the most important scientific applications of these machines. The MAE and Astrophysics departments at Princeton are at the forefront of research into the development of numerical algorithms and computer technology to utilize the next generation of machines in this effort. The engineering and scientific goals are the applications to aerodynamics (the design of airplanes, cars and ships); to turbulence research; and to structure formation in the universe. Progress in these different application areas requires a continuing research effort toward the development of algorithms amenable to parallel processing, automatic grid adaption, coloring schemes for domain decomposition of an arbitrary unstructured tetrahedral grid, and implementation of efficient message passing algorithms to reduce the communication costs on distributed memory architectures. These problems are generic, and not specific to a particular field of application. It is felt that a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of such problems would greatly benefit the training of students and enhance the effective use of high performance computing in research. The MAE and Astrophysics departments have collaborated in this effort in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. We request support for five graduate students to be trained in the design of algorithms for the numerical solution of partial differential equations using massively parallel computer platforms and the application of complex hydrocodes to engineering and physics problems ranging from turbulence research in aerodyna mics to the evolution of cosmological structure."
0.252,"9703691 Pitman Recent work of the principal investigator and co-authors has made connections between random partitions, random discrete distributions, random trees, and the lengths of excursions of Brownian motion and other stochastic processes. The present project continues the study of these relations and their applications. Sheth's model for gravitational clustering of galaxies leads to problems related to the additive coalescent in which each pair of sets in a partition of a finite set is merging at a rate which is the sum of the sizes of the two sets. Asymptotics of this additive coalescent define a discrete measure valued process which can be constructed by cutting Aldous's continuum random tree at points of a suitable Poisson process. It is proposed to study this and other measure-valued Markov processes which model coalescent phenomena, and to look for novel applications of these processes. Brownian motion provides the doundation of the modern theory of continuous time random processes with continuous paths, and has applications in fields as diverse as physics and mathematical finance. Random partitions find applications to combinatorics, physics and genetics. Statistical models for physical processes of coalescence and fragmentation are of interest in a number of fields. The evolution of a partition of particles into clumps can be variously interpreted, for example, as a partition of atoms into molecules, a partition of molecules into polymers, or a partition of stars into galaxies. In a chemical setting, atoms coalesce to form molecules, and molecules coalesce to form polymers. In a cosmological setting, stars coalesce to form galaxies. The proposed research focuses on models for an irreversible process of coalescence of a partition of a continuum with finite total mass into a finite or countable collection of sub-masses, with conservation of mass."
0.041275,"This award supports research that addresses issues relating to quantum effects in both cosmological and black hole spacetimes. These are questions related to the validity of the semi-classical approximation when it is used to describe the effects of quantized fields on a classical background field and to determine whether observable effects related to the existence of a horizon, in this case a sonic horizon, can be found in certain Bose-Einstein condensates, which can serve as black hole analogues. One project involves determining whether quantum fluctuations in the density and pressure of matter and radiation will be large during a period of inflation when the universe is expanding exponentially. If so, then the semi-classical approximation to gravity breaks down and a different method will be needed to describe what happens. A second project investigates the validity of the semiclassical approximation when the universe contracts for one important model in which the contraction is to a minimal size and is followed by an expansion. Evidence suggesting a quantum instability in this model could indicate that quantum fluctuations become large during the contraction phase. A third project investigates whether quantum effects that could be observed in laboratory studies and which are related to the existence of a horizon exist for a model in which a Bose-Einstein condensate serves as an analog for a black hole. Specifically the density density correlation function is computed in order to determine whether undulations are predicted to occur and whether other new observable effects that require the existence of a horizon can be found.<br/><br/>Completion of these projects will elucidate phenomena ranging from the expansion of the universe to potentially observable effects in black hole analogues. If quantum fluctuations prove to be large in important situations, then predictions made using the semi-classical approximation will be suspect, and a different method must be found to treat the effects of the quantized fields. The work on the validity of the semiclassical approximation could have implications for and be extended to other situations in which this approximation has been used such as the production of particles in the presence of a strong electric field and the modeling of heavy ion collisions in nuclear physics. The work on Bose-Einstein condensates which serve as analog black holes may predict specific effects that experimental condensed matter physicists can attempt to observe in laboratory experiments. If observed, these effects would provide significant evidence that predictions of quantum effects relating to black holes, such as black hole evaporation, are correct. It is expected that at least three undergraduate students and at least one graduate student will participate in many aspects of the research, continuing a long history of the training of students in numerical and analytical research techniques and co-authorship on publications. Results will be disseminated to the research community through publications and presentations at national and international meetings."
0.76338,"The goals of this project are to make more precise and more general tests of the Universality of Gravitational Free Fall. The standard, classical theory of gravity, General Relativity, incorporates the Universality of Free Fall as an exact statement about gravity. It is an experimental question, however, if this principle holds exactly. There are two strong reasons for testing the principle. First, General Relativity is not a quantum mechanical theory and some current ideas about possible quantum-mechanical theories of gravity predict violations of the Universality of Free Fall arising from additional `gravitational` scalar or vector fields. Second, by searching for violations of a symmetry that classical gravity holds to be exact, one can probe for new, ultra-weak, non-gravitational forces. Because it is impossible to shield a gravitational field, such ultra-weak forces would normally lie hidden `underneath gravity`. But any new force is expected to violate the Universality of Free Fall and so can be detected even if it is much weaker than gravity. The proposed tests require the continued development of improved instruments for measuring tiny differences in the accelerations of different materials attracted toward the earth, toward a massive Uranium laboratory source, or to astronomical structures. Three different torsion-balance instruments will be employed. Two of them, developed under previous NSF support, will be upgraded for the proposed tests, and a new more sensitive instrument will be constructed. The combination of these instruments will permit tests of the Universality of Free Fall over length scales ranging from 1 cm to infinity. In particular, it will be possible to test whether gravity is the dominant long-range force between ordinary mater and the cosmological dark matter; and, in conjunction with existing data on lunar laser-ranging, to make a `loop-hole free` test of the gravitational properties of gravitational binding energy. This last test will be performed by comparing the accelerations toward the sun of `scale models` of the Moon and the Earth's crust."

The project will relate directly the spatial distribution and physical properties of the particles in the N-Body simulations with the quantities actually measured for real high redshift galaxies.<br/><br/>Broader impacts include a program to help underrepresented minorities in their transition to college and possibly an astronomy major, and research opportunities for undergraduates."
0.310341,"This award supports continuation of a research program using a dual-isotope rubidium (Rb) magnetometer to search for a hypothetical long-range coupling between Rb nuclear spins and the mass of the earth. It will also support research to explore use of the dual-isotope Rb magnetometer and related experimental techniques to search for anomalous intermediate-range (over distance scales of about one meter) and short-range (over distance scales of about one nanometer) spin-spin couplings. The dual-isotope Rb magnetometer is particularly sensitive to non-magnetic, spin-dependent interactions of the proton so that anomalous interactions of the proton spin produce a differential shift between the Rb spin-precession frequencies, whereas most sources of systematic error produce common-mode shifts of the spin-precession frequencies which can be controlled through auxiliary measurements. The majority of recent searches for similar effects limit anomalous couplings of either the neutron or electron spin, so the proposed experiment searches a parameter space to some degree, depending on the theoretical model, orthogonal to that constrained by previous experiments. The optimized dual-isotope Rb magnetometer has sufficient shot-noise-projected sensitivity to improve experimental limits on long-range spin-mass couplings by an order of magnitude in general and by two orders of magnitude for the proton spin in particular, and improve limits on anomalous spin-spin couplings by over an order of magnitude.<br/><br/>There is renewed interest in scalar-tensor theories of gravity with massless scalar/pseudoscalar fields since they can explain the recent observation of ""dark energy"" over cosmological distances. The pseudoscalar component of such a field generates a long-range interaction between spins and the gravitational field of the Earth. This interaction in the simplest scalar-tensor theory causes a shift of the spin precession frequencies smaller than present limits but just within the range of this experiment. Detection of this type of interaction would be evidence that gravity violated parity and time-reversal symmetries, as well as the equivalence principle which underlies the theory of general relativity. A result consistent with general relativity would still provide new tests of numerous alternative theories, such as torsion gravity, that hypothesize anomalous spin-mass and spin-spin couplings. As the only externally funded physics experiment in the history of California State University / East Bay, this research program has led to tripling the number of physics majors in the past three years and sixteen students, including four women and nine underrepresented minority students, have made meaningful contributions to the project."
0.1,"This award supports preliminary research on a new method to test Newton's law of gravity at length scales shorter than 100 micrometers. Recent theoretical suggestions including unification scenarios, extra dimensions, and cosmological considerations involving dark energy all involve the possibility of a breakdown of Newtonian gravity for short ranges. Previously published results by the PI and others described upper limits to such a breakdown at around 100 micrometers using a torsion pendulum with an array of holes. The new method uses a different true null-experiment with a simple, yet highly efficient geometry designed to detect violations of Newtonian gravity at much shorter distances. A vertical plate torsion pendulum will hang parallel to an attractor plate which generates a uniform gravitational field. As this plate is moved toward and away from the pendulum, the forces on the pendulum will not change if Newtonian gravity holds. To maximize the pendulum's sensitivity to violations of Newtonian gravity, it is made from a plate with a step in its density profile, so that one half of the plate's mass is closer to the attractor than the other. To avoid forces due to electrostatics and residual gas, a thin metallic membrane is placed in the space between the attractor and the pendulum. This experiment is an alternative approach to test using existing torsion balances, with entirely different systematic uncertainties and the potential to test gravity at length scales as small as 20 micrometers. This award will support graduate students to build a scientific instrument and conduct a very challenging measurement, providing excellent training in all the aspects of experimental physics and scientific research. The new method involves many technical innovations that may find applications in other areas such as gravity-wave detection."
0.439447,"This work is about models of Milky Way formation and evolution models in two ways. It continues and expands a program to map the Galactic halo structure using photometric data for 4,000 RR Lyrae stars from the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) survey. This extends the distance limit of current maps and can place better constraints on halo structure. In addition, numerical simulations of galaxy formation are compared to the observational results and to further data sets such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This is a quantitative test whether cosmologically motivated state-of-the-art N-body models reproduce the observed spatial, kinematic, and metallicity distributions of the Milky Way stars. <br/><br/>The LINEAR photometric database will be made publicly available and will be a good resource for other researchers in the field.

0.259378,"Dr. Szkody and her collaborators will conduct three projects on interacting binary stars. In the first, they will measure changes in the orbital period of the only known eclipsing binary of the AM CVn type; this will yield the rate of orbital energy lost through the emission of gravitational radiation. The second project will measure the temperatures and other properties of pulsating white dwarf stars to determine the location of the onset of instability. Finally, they will investigate certain other systems to measure changes in angular momentum with mass accretion, which may shed light on the formation of Type Ia supernovae.<br/><br/>These projects are expected to have an impact in several areas of binary evolution. For example, understanding the gravitational wave radiation from binaries will help distinguish signals of individual objects from cosmological signals in future gravitational wave experiments such as LISA (Laser Gravitational Wave Antenna).

His main emphasis is on the study of incompressible surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds, representations of the fundamental groups of such 3-manifolds, and the geometry and structure of closed geodesics in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Since the space of everyday life is three dimensional, understanding the structure of objects of this dimension is likely to be especially relevant to the real world. This world is certainly locally Euclidean, but on a cosmological scale it may well be hyperbolic -- at issue is the behavior of light paths of enormous length. In any event the techniques invented to answer questions about hyperbolic manifolds have surprisingly many applications elswehere in mathematics and theoretical physics."

Evidence possibly related to the binary nature of these objects has started a new branch of supernovae research to determine when the photospheres of supernovae become spherical and to better understand the dispersion in luminosity and color between objects due to effects of asphericity near supernova maximum. They are exploring the nature of the collapse of the stellar core, specifically probing asymmetries in the explosion with spectropolarimetry. One key factor in determining the physical nature of core collapse supernovae is the geometry of portions of the ejecta of different composition. This is determined by careful spectropolarimetry. Dynamical models of core collapse that generate bipolar and more complex flows are being tested to determine the degree of fundamental asymmetry in the explosion necessary to imprint different polarization in different chemical layers of the ejecta.

The balance of this exchange with time is thought to explain a number of key galaxy properties. The proposing team will test modern models of galaxy assembly by studying the relationship between galaxies and their circumgalactic gas using a combination of space- and ground-based gas-phase spectroscopy, ground-based optical imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies, and numerical simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. Specifically, they will: (1) measure the metallicity distribution in circumgalactic gas using high-resolution spectral observations of quasar absorption lines; (2) determine the covering factor of cold gas as a function of distance from the absorbing galaxies; (3) compare the physical and statistical properties of the circumgalactic gas with those of the central galaxies; and (4) develop new simulations and diagnostics to compare model predictions with observations.

0.457936,"This project will study how particles get accelerated to high speeds in astrophysical sources, focusing on a special mechanism known as Fermi acceleration. Although it is believed that a considerable fraction of the energy in material flowing around pulsars, supernovae, and other strong sources, can be converted into very fast particles, which are identified by the patterns of radiation they give off, the mechanism is not well understood. After this study, the Fermi mechanism will be much better characterized, and may be tightly constrained.<br/><br/>Acceleration of particles in collisionless shocks is at the heart of most models of non-thermal phenomena in the Universe. Observations of synchrotron emission suggest that such shocks in pulsar wind nebulae, in jets from active galactic nuclei, in gamma-ray bursts, and in supernova remnants, can convert a significant fraction of the flow energy into relativistic particles with power-law spectra. However, although it is usually invoked as the cause, the conditions for operation of the first-order Fermi mechanism and its efficiency are not understood from first principles. This project will construct a self-consistent theory of shock acceleration by performing large-scale multidimensional particle-in-cell and hybrid simulations of astrophysical collisionless shocks, and study the microphysics of plasma instabilities, particle scattering, and magnetic field generation, necessary to calibrate nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration theory. Specific questions include: 1) the criteria for existence of shock acceleration, and its efficiency; 2) how accelerated particles influence shock structure and evolution; 3) the proton and electron spectra generated in realistic shocks. The tools developed during this work will enable multi-scale modeling of shocks and will derive particle spectra in the nonlinear regime from first principles. This research will provide predictive power to the hypothesis that Fermi acceleration in collisionless shocks is the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and non-thermal particles, and could place tight constraints on the models of magnetization and on the composition of astrophysical outflows.<br/><br/>Because Fermi acceleration is a fundamental process in astrophysics, the results will be of value to observers, experimentalists, and theorists studying high-energy astrophysical and cosmological sources, and are even applicable to shocks in the solar system. The findings will guide a new generation of laboratory experiments. The work will involve postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate students, training them in numerical modeling and visualization, and thus preparing them for careers in science and technology fields, where large-scale computing increasingly plays an important role. An interactive plasma physics tutorial will be developed to bring intuitive understanding of these thorny subjects to specialists and the general public alike."
0.333977,"Dr. Kritsuk and his team study dynamics of magnetized turbulence and star formation in molecular clouds with numerical high-resolution simulations. The computations are done with the Enzo code, an Adaptive Mesh Refinement and grid-based hybrid code (hydrodymamics and N-body), which is designed to do simulations of astrophysical and cosmological structure formation. The self-consistent computations model effects such as gravity, differential rotation, and radiative transfer on the self-organization in compressible magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the multiphase interstellar medium. The models here incorporate more complex physics, a higher dynamic range of resolved scales, and employ improved numerical methods. In particular, the modeling includes the scaling of multiphase MHD turbulence and its change with the turbulence magnetization. The simulations for the dynamic range of MHD models for molecular cloud formation utilize petascale computational facilities and attempt to resolve the inertial range of supersonic magnetized turbulence in the multiphase interstellar medium. This will test competing star formation models and phenomenological theories when the simulations are compared to observations. More broadly, a better understanding of turbulence is also needed for understanding the acceleration and propagation of energetic particles, transport of momentum and energy in various astrophysical systems. As part of this project, one graduate student will be trained in the development of numerical methods for modeling supersonic MHD flows, in large-scale parallel computer simulations, and in methods for statistical analysis and visualization of magnetized multiphase turbulent flows."

This project will use a combination of observations and simulations to read that record, focusing on two key interrelated topics: the measurement of precise cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the detection and measurement of the effects of energy flows from quasars and galaxies into the intergalactic gas. A large set of high resolution quasar spectra from the Keck observatory will be compared to various sophisticated simulations to study the amount of dark energy, the amplitude and slope of the power spectrum of matter on small scales, the ionization and temperature of the intergalactic gas, the intensity and spectrum of the ionizing radiation, and the energy input from quasars and galaxies, including the input and distribution of metals.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the work builds upon the team's long record of integrating education and diversity with their research.

0.257294,"Anywhere that there is a fluid in motion, whether liquid or gas, there will be turbulence. These disturbances to the flow can be very significant, but their possibly profound effect on the formation of galaxies out of the cosmic gas remains an area of mystery in our fundamental understanding of how the Universe evolves. This work seeks to correct this lack, using high powered computers to carry out novel numerical simulations with very high resolution. For the first time, pretty well all of the physics involved in forming stars within galaxies will be included. The calculations will be intimately connected with telescope data, both checking the computer results and helping to understand the observations. The new ideas will also be useful for other studies of turbulent fluids.<br/><br/>Cosmic gas flows have high velocities, span enormous scales, and are highly turbulent, but the possibly profound effects of turbulence on galaxy formation are largely unexplored. This project is a systematic exploration of turbulence and its effects on accretion flows, star formation, and the structure of galaxies, in self-consistent cosmological simulations using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Part of the work will implement and test a novel model for sub-grid scale turbulence and use it to estimate local turbulent stresses. This model will be used to add new physically-motivated prescriptions for star formation into the galaxy formation simulations, incorporating a rich set of physical processes thought to be critical for comparison with observations, including modeling of molecular hydrogen, chemical enrichment and evolution, dust formation and destruction, radiative transfer of ionizing and far-ultraviolet radiation, star formation, and stellar feedback with radiation pressure and cosmic rays. Observational comparisons will test and inform the theoretical models, while the simulation results will help to understand the data. Scientific results will include quantifying the effects of turbulence on the cold accretion gas flows onto galaxies, assessing the relative contribution of dynamical drivers of turbulence, and quantifying the effects of turbulence on the density structure of the gas. The emphasis on observational comparisons will make this study particularly valuable for interpreting the results from current and future facilities. Both the methods and the results will be of value for other simulations and for semi-analytic models. The simulations also lend themselves well to high-fidelity, scientifically-accurate visualizations well suited to the high resolution environment of full-dome planetarium projectors, but of value to all planetaria."

The detection by Dr. Cowan and his collaborators of the long-lived radioactive element thorium in several, and recently uranium in one, Galactic halo stars has provided a perhaps unique opportunity to directly determine the ages of the oldest stars. Dr. Cowan will also introduce a chronometer pair, Th/Hf, to make age determinations for the oldest stars in the Galaxy. These studies, independent of cosmological models and parameters and chemical evolution models, will result in more accurate age estimates for the oldest stars than previously possible and will help to answer the fundamental questions of just how old are the Galaxy and the Universe.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed research activity involve several areas. The NSF-supported research is incorporated directly into the course curriculum of Dr. Cowan's regularly taught introductory astronomy course for non-science majors.

0.335028,"One of the primary objectives of extragalactic astronomy is to understand the formation and evolution of structures over cosmic time. Clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, and so a better understanding of their formation and evolution leads to deeper knowledge of the physics of the cosmos. In order to fully probe the physics and evolution of clusters, however, a co-ordinated multi-wavelength campaign is needed: while observations with X-ray telescopes are excellent at finding clusters, follow-up observations with optical telescopes are critical to measuring their distances from us. <br/><br/>This collaborative project will use the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) 2.4m, Magellan, and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) optical observatories to measure the redshifts and distances to clusters identified in the X-ray Swift Serendipitous Cluster Survey (SSCS). The program will produce one of the largest X-ray selected cluster catalogs to date, and make it available to the entire astronomical community. The increased numbers of high-redshift clusters as a result of this work will lead to a better understanding of the evolution of cluster properties over cosmic time. The team will also study the relationships between the optical and X-ray properties of clusters as a function of redshift. Finally, they will use the sample to constrain cosmological parameters, such as the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy. <br/><br/>The two Principal Investigators of this collaboration will also launch an innovative series of outreach events that are designed to further develop the STEM workforce. At the University of Oklahoma-Norman, Dr. Xinyu Dai will use a portable planetarium to deliver presentations to high schools in the Greater Oklahoma City area. At the same time, Dr. Joel Bregman will develop new shows for the on-campus planetarium at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor.

The connection between the vacuum energy and periodic classical orbits via the semiclassical Maslov indices will be analyzed in particular by looking at the eigenvalue energy distributions. The PIs propose also to calculate the vacuum energies and spectral densities near boundary edges and corners: the spectral effects of such singular boundaries are also of mathematical interest in connection with generalized index theorems, which may include other explicit physical applications. <br/>The broader impact of the project stems partly from its interdisciplinary nature. Vacuum energy is relevant both to new nanotechnology devices and to cosmological issues (""dark energy"").

The MWA-LFD is a collaboration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), the Australian University Consortium, the Australian Telescope National Facility (ATNF), and the Western Australia government. The MWA-LFD will be located at the Mileura radio quiet site in the Western Australian desert. This scientifically capable array, consisting of 500 phased-array antennas feeding sophisticated digital signal processing systems, will have high sensitivity, broad 80-300 MHz frequency coverage, very high spectral and temporal resolution, electronic pointing agility and multi-beaming capability. Most importantly, it will feature an inherently very wide ~30 degrees instantaneous field of view. This combination of properties allows the demonstration array to perform cutting-edge science experiments with much better sensitivity than any existing instrument. This science capability will be available two years after the start of funding, and the last two years of the program will focus on science investigations with the array.<br/><br/>The science goals of the MWA-LFD are in three main areas of investigation. The highest priority is to detect and characterize redshifted neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) signals from the cosmological Epoch of Reionization. The array will be capable of measuring the power spectrum of fluctuations, as well as imaging structures created by Stromgren spheres around quasars at redshifts with z~6.5, providing the first view of the cosmic dark ages. and early structure formation in the Universe. Second, the wide field capabilities of the array will be exploited to perform a blind search for transient sources of radio emission which is 6 orders of magnitude more sensitive than any previous work in this frequency range. Third, the array will be used to probe the heliosphere with unprecedented precision using interplanetary scintillation (IPS) and Faraday rotation techniques. The Faraday rotation holds the unique promise of constraining the orientation of the magnetic field in coronal mass ejection (CME) events, which is essential for predicting the impact of solar storms on the earth. Several other scientific topics, such as pulsar studies, solar bursts, the local structure of the interstellar medium, and radio recombination lines, can also be effectively addressed with the array.<br/><br/>The MWA-LFD will demonstrate a broad range of technologies and techniques that are essential for the future feasibility and performance of full-scale wide field arrays that are currently in a conceptual stage of development. The MWA-LFD is relevant to cyber-infrastructure and cyber-science initiatives in the development of an astronomical telescope with no moving parts, all ""actions"" are handled electronically, and in the demonstration of new data handling techniques, involving massive, near real-time processing and preliminary analysis, followed by data compression. The application of the MWA-LFD to heliospheric measurements will make an important contribution to the National Space Weather Program, and thus will have valuable societal benefits. The project will be executed by multiple national and international partners, which offer opportunities for student exchange, and promotion of international scientific relations. The grant will train postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and will engage undergraduate students and teachers in the project at no cost to the grant, through existing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) programs at MIT and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).

0.381534,"Galaxies are the birthplace of stars and planets, and act as cosmic signposts for the invisible dark matter. The shapes and colors of galaxies provide important insight into how and when galaxies formed their stars and merged to become larger galaxies. Dr. Lotz and team will devise innovative software tools to measure the structures of thousands of nearby galaxies, and compare the distribution of shapes of today's galaxies to distant ones observed as they were ~10 billion years ago. By tracking the metamorphosis of galaxy shapes over cosmic time, and by comparing with simulations of galaxy evolution, the project will illuminate the physical processes governing the evolution of galaxies like our own Milky Way. The tools developed by this project will help to fully exploit future astronomy surveys with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. Besides its scientific significance, the project will support the training of a postdoctoral fellow, and the education of a graduate student and a Baltimore-city high school student. The broader public will be engaged through a related citizen science project to study galaxy images. <br/><br/>The stellar and gaseous structures of galaxies provide direct insight into their most recent assembly events, as well as longer timescale internal secular processes, both of which drive galaxy star-formation and quenching. However, the existing coarse structural classifications fail to capture the complex assembly processes responsible for the morphological transformation of galaxies over the past 10 billion years. Building upon working currently being done for redshifts 0.5<z<3, this project will develop new non-parametric, quantitative measures of galaxy structure, identifying galaxy mergers and classifying galaxy morphology, and apply this approach to nearby galaxies in the Pan-STARRS Optical Galaxy Survey. This low-redshift baseline will be compared to high-redshift observations by the Hubble Space Telescope to track the emergence of spheroidal galaxies and the frequency of different types of galaxy mergers over time. In concert with this observational analysis, the investigators will statistically compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from Illustris to the distribution and evolution of morphologies of observed galaxies at redshifts 0<z<3; this will provide physical insights into the measured structural quantities and distributions, and place constraints on the viable modes for galaxy assembly and evolution."

The DOT system, a product of the paradigm shift from large-scale applications running on large parallel systems at single sites to those running on distributed systems, has come about by the availability of high-speed optical networks (E.g., Starlight, TeraGrid 40 Gb/s network, the PacificRail 10 Gb/s network). This shift necessitates techniques that allow applications to efficiently utilize distributed systems. In contrast to parallel systems, these systems must exploit two characteristics:<br/>Heterogeneity of resources (processors and networks) and <br/>Dynamic changes in performance of shared resources, especially wide area networks. <br/>The system, consisting of Linux clusters at six geographically different sites interconnected via two existing research DWDM networks, I-WIRE and OMNInet, involves the following sites: Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA), Northwester University Chicago Campus (NU-C), Northwestern University Evanston Campus (NU-E), and the University of Chicago (UC). DOT will facilitate the following research activities in the area of distributed applications:<br/>Dynamic Load Balancing (Taylor)<br/>Performance Monitoring and Prediction (Dinda, Sun, Taylor)<br/>Data Management (Choudhary, Foster)<br/>The first activity develops techniques utilizing network performance predictions that take into consideration the heterogeneity of the processors and networks of distributed systems to dynamically balance the load during execution.

The virtual numerical laboratory that will be created represents technical solutions widely applicable to many areas of scientific and educational endeavor.<br/><br/>Cosmological computer simulations with large dynamic range that model statistically representative parts of the observable universe are an essential component of the quest to understand the structure of the universe, and in particular how galaxies form, how they are distributed in space, and how environment influences their evolution. The data sets produced by such simulations have started to exceed in size and richness the results of the largest observational surveys, straining the computational and storage resources that support the required complex algorithms. This is especially true because much of the analysis will be performed by scientists who were not involved in the original work and may be unfamiliar with the properties of the simulation outputs. This project will allow access to the original simulations, and simultaneously extend and complete the creation of synthetic observations that can be directly compared to telescope data. The system will allow experts and non-experts to investigate the virtual universes created by simulations and match them to observation, by forming a virtual observatory with access to everything from raw outputs, through idealized intermediate products, to realistic model observations. Users can investigate such aspects of gravitational collapse as scaling relations and distinct clustering patterns, and study systematic biases and information loss. The objective is to enable everyone to perform the sort of scientific experiments on simulation data that can currently only be done by specialists.<br/><br/>The broadly usable technical solutions that will be created by this study will tie raw Petabyte size simulation output files to structured relational databases, with direct applications as diverse as turbulence and genomics.

0.474135,"Professor Richard Elston will carry out a five-year observational program to study the formation of galaxies and the large-scale structure in the Universe. The core of the program is the first systematic study of the clustering of galaxies at redshifts between z = 1 and 2. By observing the galaxies in the universe in this redshift range, we are seeing the Universe as it was about 7-9 billion years ago. The measurement of the number and richness of galaxy clusters when the universe was young provides a direct constraint on the amplitude of the initial power spectrum of the universe, from which all structures formed. Additionally, this cluster data will be used to determine the mass density (Omega) and test for the presence of the cosmological constant (Lambda). <br/><br/>Prof. Elston has developed a technique to search for distant clusters of galaxies in the near-infrared (IR). The galaxies that populate the clusters tend to be red and therefore emit the bulk of their light in the near-IR. Thus, the clusters tend to stand out much more prominently in the near-IR than in the optical. It has been shown the contrast of the clusters can be further enhanced by selecting galaxies with near-IR wavelength bands J-K >-1.8. This makes it possible to select only galaxies at z > 1. This new technique was recently tested by observing a small galaxy cluster at z = 1.27 in a small near-IR survey that was just completed. The plan is to carry out a very wide field near-IR survey of 18 square degrees to K < 20.5 and J < 22.5. Due to the extreme optical faintness of the galaxies and since there is a lack of strong spectral features in the optical wavelengths for galaxies with 1.3 < z <2.3, galaxy redshifts using a near-IR multi-object spectrometer will be used to observe the galaxies. The obtaining the spectra for thousands of possible cluster members in the IR was beyond the capability of any previously existing astronomical instrument. The new FLAMINGOS infrared wavelength instrument, which Prof. Elston is building and is to be completed in the fall of 1999, will be used for these observations.<br/><br/>A scientific education program aimed at elementary school students; undergraduate university students and graduate students in astronomy will be integrated with this observational research program.

The length-scales involved range, literally, from the size of the universe down to the scale of elementary particles. High-performance scientific computing is an indispensable tool in tackling these challenging problems. However, the output generated by simulation of such systems is so large that long-term storage of the data at its source has been problematic. This has led to a prevalent style of research in which very valuable scientific data is used once and then discarded. <br/><br/>Utilizing Major Research Instrumentation Funds, the Digital Laboratory for Multiscale Sciences (DLMS) at the Johns Hopkins University will realize a new paradigm in the study of multiscale systems: that of using an integrated database and cluster as a ``virtual laboratory''. This system will allow for fast in-house simulations of the large-scale systems of interest, combined with a long-term storage capability of up to 100 Terabytes of data, search rates of about 10 Gigabytes per second, and fast, flexible computational analysis tools within the database itself. This will allow us to approach parameter space and physical domain sizes that were entirely beyond our reach. Among other projects, a simulation of incompressible fluid turbulence, at an unprecedented grid size of 550 billion points, will be performed at national laboratories and US supercomputer centers and housed and analyzed at the DLMS. We expect that breakthrough developments will be facilitated in an interdisciplinary program of research in science and engineering across the spectrum of multiscale systems. <br/><br/>About fifty graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows working at the DLMS will receive training in the areas of multiscale sciences, numerical simulation, parallel computing, visualization, data analysis, and data-base technology.

The recent detection of reionization, and thus star formation, at high redshift, underscores the pivotal role played by the creation and destruction of these molecules at early times. However, significant uncertainties, even to orders of magnitude, exist in the published atomic data for the particularly important charge exchange and rearrangement reactions. These uncertainties translate into major inaccuracies in the predicted relative abundances of both molecules at this key epoch. This study comprises a series of laboratory investigations to measure the rate coefficients for the relevant reactions in the relevant temperature range for cosmological object formation.

(2) How well do models that yield galaxies matching global galaxy properties also match the observed properties of the gaseous reservoirs? (3) How does the CGM regulate the baryon cycle and galaxy evolution? (4) Do current analysis methods of absorption lines yield inferred gas properties (metallicities, spatial-kinematics distributions, gas phases, and gas reservoir masses) that are consistent with the gas being probed in the simulations? (5) What are the quantitative relationships between inferred gas properties from observational analysis and the gas actually giving rise to the absorption?

This project, the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey, will chart the evolution of the rest-frame optical spectra for approximately 2000 galaxies between 1.5 and 3.5, more than an order of magnitude improvement over existing surveys. The project will make use of 44 nights allocated on the Keck I telescope through 2016, and will survey three well-studied regions of the sky already having extensive multi-wavelength datasets. By combining new and existing data, the proposing team will characterize the star formation and accreting black hole activity in distant galaxies, their masses, contents and structures, and the manner in which baryonic matter passes through them. In collaboration with theorists, the MOSDEF team will use these results to test and inform forefront models of galaxy evolution. The MOSDEF spectra will be publicly released to the astronomical community to enable additional investigations. Graduate and undergraduate students will be supported by the project and involved in the research, and team members will develop pedagogical resources for K-12 teachers on the key aspects of the science and techniques."
0.475,"Topological structures are central to many different branches of physics, at a variety of different energy and length scales. Quantized vortices, for example, express the rotational properties of a superfluid system; and, cosmologically, Dirac monopoles have long been sought in the magnetic field since evidence for their existence has implications for the quantization of charge. Here, several experimental aspects of topological structures in the pristine and highly controllable context of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are explored. The dynamics of small clusters of interacting quantized vortices and their response to changing environmental conditions, including temperature and the strength of the interatomic interactions, are explored using real-time imaging techniques under development as a central part of the project. More exotic topological structures in spinor condensates are also sought for study, including merons (two-component vortex ""molecules"") and Dirac monopoles.<br/><br/>Research on topological structures engages fundamental problems in basic physics and the nature of the world. Progress toward answering these questions contributes to the understanding of increasingly complex phenomena and ultimately to its application to problems of significance. Here, one might envision a study of superfluid rotation as leading to the creation of more sensitive rotation detectors. Of more direct and immediate benefit is the emphasis on education and training of undergraduates of diverse backgrounds in the performance of cutting-edge research in physics. This training takes place much earlier than is typical of research universities. The participating students then become active members of the next generation of scientists and citizens."
0.025152,"Increasing rates of socioeconomic change are associated with widespread increases in social distress and related mental illnesses, yet health systems often struggle to develop the capacity and knowledge for responding to mental disorders. Focusing on the biological dimensions of mental illness, scientists predominantly search for biomedical solutions. Recent studies, however, have called into question the effectiveness of biomedical treatment models, noting unexpectedly good mental-illness prognoses among populations with scant historic access to biomedical interventions. These positive prognoses have been attributed to cultural and familial practices. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, seeks to understand the impact of rapid socioeconomic change on the mental health and treatment of marginal populations. <br/><br/>Cornell University graduate student Ting Hui Lau under the supervision of Dr. Magnus Fiskesjo, will examine indigenous mental illness categories and traditional healing practices in rural Southwest China where ethnic and religious minority populations are undergoing rapid socioeconomic change. Her study includes the following two major components: First, she will document and analyze indigenous illness categories, religious cosmologies, and associated healing practices. Second, she will ethnographically evaluate the transformation of these practices in the context of rapid development. Her project advances social scientific understanding of mental illness by (1) evaluating the impact of rapid social and economic change on marginalized minority communities and their mental health; (2) deepening scholar's and policymaker's understandings of how marginalized communities derive resilience from indigenous spiritual practices in the face of social distress; and (3) contributing to scientific knowledge of the nature and origins of mental illness by giving more consideration to the social and cultural dimensions of mental illness. Methods include participant observation, open-ended interviews, and the collection of life histories, all of which are widely accepted and standard ethnographic approaches for this type of study."
0.053052,"AST-1109243/1109008<br/>Norman/Reynolds<br/><br/>Adaptive mesh refinement cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulations pioneered by this group have recently expanded to include sufficient physics and enough resolution to simulate directly the prior effects of Population III star-forming mini-halos on the first galaxies. This technical advance has occurred just when observations from both ground and space are providing astrophysical data on galaxies in the previously unimaginable range of redshifts from 6 to 8.5. These observations indicate substantial evolution in the bright end of the luminosity function, and a steep faint end slope consistent with the notion that high-redshift dwarfs dominate the reionization photon budget. They also reveal substantial evolution in stellar populations over this redshift interval. The advance in simulation capability is also well timed for the start of operations of the first NSF-supported sustained petaflops supercomputer, Blue Waters.<br/><br/>Combining these software, hardware, and data advances, this project will simulate the formation and evolution of the first galaxies across the entire range of masses and luminosities observed, and compare the results to the data through simulated images and spectra. This will lead to inferences about the Population III initial mass function, feedback effects, the growth of supermassive black holes, and even the dark matter power spectrum, and place important constraints on the accretion rate of gas onto galaxies. The simulations will improve estimates of the escape of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic medium, and directly address whether high-redshift galaxies are capable of reionizing the Universe. This is the very first time such near-first-principles simulations are feasible, due to the convergence of petascale computing hardware, simulation software, and algorithmic advances, and also the first time that relevant observational constraints are being obtained.<br/><br/>Simulations at this scale have a strong impact on the astronomical community, the high performance computing community, and the larger science and technology-curious public. They drive the development of the hardware, software, and networking infrastructure. This project is one of six selected for first access to NSF's new petascale supercomputer, and the required code enhancements will be made generally available. There are also plans to include these scientific results in a new IMAX film by the Reuben H.Fleet Science Museum in Balboa Park, San Diego, anticipated in 2013."

The team, by correlating the colors of quasars with the density of foreground galaxies, has established that these galaxies (on average) have dust halos extending out to on the order of 10 megaparsecs. In this project they will greatly increase the depth and wavelength coverage of the analysis, applying their existing techniques and making use of the newest archival data releases from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Deep Lens Survey, and the deep sample of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (optical), the GALEX satellite (ultraviolet), and the FIRST survey (radio). They will study the dependence of the dust extent and absorption properties on galaxy luminosity, morphological type, and redshift; constrain the physical nature of the dust and possible scenarios for the enrichment of galaxy halos; and assess the impact that extended dust will have on future measurements of the expansion and acceleration of the universe. A software package developed by the PI for analyzing multiwavelength data from disparate sources (STOMP) will be made available to the community.

0.932,"The possibility of charge parity (CP) violation in the neutrino sector may be crucial to understanding the evolution and matter dominance of the Universe. Neutrino oscillations are of fundamental interest, probing new phenomena at both subatomic and cosmological scales. The William and Mary particle physics group is heavily invested in the neutrino program at Fermilab, and active on MINOS, MINERvA, and NOvA experiments. While the data taking phase of MINOS will come to a close in the near term, analysis will continue for the first year of this grant. MINOS will make a final statement on compelling problems in neutrino physics, such as the<br/>search for muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions, the value of the neutrino oscillation parameters, and the existence of sterile neutrinos. As the statistical precision of these measurements improves, the ultimate precision of MINOS, other current experiments, and the optimal design of future experiments, is hampered by the poor understanding of neutrino interactions. The William and Mary group will continue to exploit its investment in MINERvA to measure neutrino reactions across a wide energy range. Furthermore, the William and Mary group has adopted a strong role in NO&#957;A, the next generation experiment designed to study muon neutrino to electron neutrino transitions. Indications of a potentially large value of theta_13 from the Daya Bay Experiment imply that the NOvA physics program will indeed be rich, perhaps able to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy. Finally, the William and Mary group will capitalize on the opportunity to run the MINOS detectors in the NOvA era. The neutrino flux in the new beam configuration will peak at energies above the oscillation maximum, but the high rates will enable sensitive studies of the energy dependence of the oscillation probability.<br/><br/>On broader impacts, William and Mary is committed to engaging undergraduates in research as a vital component of their education. The group's program provides summer research opportunities for undergraduates and enables senior research thesis topics. Beyond promoting science education, the group will team-teach an Emerging Scholars program at a local elementary school. The debut of this program will be in winter 2012 and will consist of ten weekly after-school sessions. An inherent goal of the after-school program is to expose students from historically underrepresented communities to the sciences and to practicing physicists and exciting science activities.

0.00799,"This dissertation project proposes research on the origins and development of SETI, a modern scientific field comprised of several highly innovative research programs and organizations. SETI (the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) is a branch of radio astronomy in which researchers utilize large radio telescopes, small satellite dishes, or optical telescopes to search for electromagnetic signals of intelligent origin. Study of this scientific field offers greater understanding of scientific organization, practice, and the relationship between science and the public. Specifically, this project posits that SETI is a unique scientific activity in which researchers are inventing: 1) new organizational forms; 2) new scientific practices infected by feedback from the public; and 3) new ways of engaging and enrolling the public in basic scientific research. SETI is a scientific activity that explicitly addresses issues of deep cultural significance. SETI researchers often point out that demonstrating the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent life would have profound effects upon cosmological, religious, and popular conceptions of our place in the universe. In part because of this, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) terminated direct funding for SETI programs in 1993. SETI scientists and researchers have therefore been forced to appeal directly to the public to obtain the funds, expertise, and other resources necessary to carry out search programs. This has resulted in a wide proliferation of innovative organizational forms within the SETI research community. This project will explore: 1) the diversity of organizational forms through which SETI research is carried out; 2) how these organizational contexts affect scientific practice; and 3) how these different organizational structures have cultivated/limited public involvement in SETI. This project proposes 11 months of field research to: 1) interview and interact with researchers affiliated with SETI organizations throughout the continental United States; 2) conduct archival research at organizations that have sponsored SETI research work; 3) participate in various public presentations, conventions, and conferences at which SETI scientists interact with members of the general public; and 4) map the ways that SETI is understood by enthusiasts and in popular culture. Primary data for this study will be collected through more than 40 in-depth, focused interviews conducted with SETI researchers, volunteers, and enthusiasts. In order to frame informants' perspectives within the larger historical and social context in which SETI research is done, interview data will be supplemented with ethnographic data and archival sources. This research design is built upon site visits and preliminary interviews conducted between March and October of 1999."

0.291044,"Vacuum (Casimir) energy in quantum field theory is of interest in the physics community and its connections with some mathematical topics in spectral theory and asymptotics of differential operators have recently become clearer. Thus this collaboration between physicists and mathematicians is an effective approach to further progress. The investigators intend to build on the results of their previous collaboration to make progress in two areas: (1) Gravitational significance of vacuum energy: The previous work has demonstrated that vacuum energy gravitates just as does any other form of energy. For plane geometries the divergences renormalize the masses of the material bodies confining the field. This analysis will be extended to general geometries. This requires the mathematical theory of the asymptotics of (Schwartz) distributions as well as sound physics. (2) Improved calculational methods: In the presence of curved surfaces, higher-order corrections are hard to calculate in classical-path analyses of vacuum energy and eigenvalue distribution. In the presence of sharp edges or corners (other than right angles) the semiclassical methods break down quite seriously (diffraction). The project will develop and apply more fundamental and accurate analyses, known as multiple reflection or multiple scattering. Previous success in treating the forces between dielectric bodies by multiple scattering will be extended and applications to practical configurations such as noncontact gears and multilayer surfaces are being pursued. Also, the multiple-reflection expansion will be used for accurate calculation of vacuum energy density and pressure near curved surfaces and edges and corners.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project stems partly from its interdisciplinary nature. The subject not only combines physics and mathematics, but also combines topics within physics and within mathematics that are ripe for productive interaction. Vacuum energy is relevant both to new nanotechnological devices and to cosmological issues (dark energy). Mathematically, the connection between periodic-orbit theory and vacuum energy has only recently been exploited, and the implications of vacuum energy for spectral theory have barely been explored. Undergraduate and graduate student research assistants from both physics and mathematics will be recruited and their educations will be enhanced, and a diverse student population is being trained.

The algorithm smoothes the data set, constructs surfaces of constant density (density contours) and measures the topology of the contour surfaces as a function of density enhancement. The preliminary results obtained so far have been quite encouraging. In many models (including those involving cold dark matter) the topology of smoothed constant density enhancement at the present epoch reflects that present in the initial conditions. Models with random phases (as might arise form quantum noise in inflationary cosmologies) have a universal dependence of topology on density enhancement which can be compared with the observations. These studies should provide some important new insights into the nature of the observed topology and its relation to the initial conditions that produced it."

0.0105,"Science manifestly has the capacity to change our views of the world. Major transformations of our world view, however, are relatively rare. The paradigm case is that of the Scientific Revolution of the 16th & 17th Centuries in which the traditional view of a closed universe with the stationary earth at its center was replaced by an infinite universe in which the earth is one of several planets circling the sun. Another radical transformation of our world view occurred at the start of the 19th century. In this case, geological sciences replaced the classical understanding of a brief history of the earth traditionally derived from the Bible, to the vastly extended histories associated with modern radiometric methods and modern cosmologies. This temporal transformation, as significant in its extent as the spatial transformation of the Scientific Revolution, is surprisingly poorly understood and is too often described in terms limited to the simplistic models of the conflict of science and religion. Although the issues are generally framed in terms of an expanding time scale, the magnitude of time itself was actually of less importance than the character of the history (of the earth and of life, including human life) that was believed to have filled it. The crucial period in this outstandingly important development was the first half of the 19th century (with the last years of the 18th).

0.12,"""This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).""<br/><br/>Cosmological data have established that most of the energy density of the Universe is made of two mysterious components, dark energy and dark matter. The most promising candidate for dark matter is a new weakly interacting particle with a mass near the electroweak scale, suggesting a tantalizing connection with electroweak symmetry breaking. The PI intends to investigate this connection by developing and exploring models beyond the Standard Model with unusual particle dark matter candidates, and calculating the astrophysical detection prospects as well as their novel collider signals. Remarkable dark matter detection experiments are now underway which have already provided unprecedented clues to the properties of dark matter. Very recent results, including the reconfirmation of the DAMA annual modulation, the PAMELA positron ratio excess, and others, are strongly suggestive of electroweak scale candidates with unusual properties. Simultaneously, the start of the large hadron collider this year will revolutionize our knowledge of the electroweak scale. The PI intends to exploit these opportunities to actively participate in uncovering the nature and identity of dark matter. As to broader implacts, the PI plans a series of integrated outreach programs afforded by the strong public appeal of the physics of the Universe to broaden the impact of this proposal. The PI has begun a working relationship with South Eugene High School with plans to expand students' opportunities for research through advising their Senior Research Project. The PI is proposing a new public lecture series that will bring forefront researchers to Oregon. Using the University of Oregon's recently enlarged Portland facility, the public outreach effort would be directed at Oregon's largest population center and combined with new opportunities to have leading researchers visit with undergraduates at traditional liberal arts colleges such as Reed College.<br/>This program allows opportunities for undergraduates of wide backgrounds to be inquisitive and become excited by research as well as developing ideas for senior thesis research projects."
0.456,"PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0758082<br/>INSTITUTION: Ohio State University Research Foundation<br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Beatty, James J.<br/><br/>TITLE: Particle Astrophysics at the Energy Frontier with the Auger Observatory<br/><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) is an international project aimed at the study of the highest energy cosmic rays. These highest energy particles in the Universe are very rare, and the elucidation of the mystery of their origin is one of the key challenges in modern astrophysics. They interact with the cosmic microwave background, as noted in 1966 by Greisen, Zatzepin and Kuz'min. As a result, cosmic rays with energies of ~10**20 eV are strongly attenuated over cosmological distances, and sources nearer than ~50 Mpc are expected to be dominant. The PAO, a large hybrid detector employing both the surface detector and air fluorescence techniques, is nearing completion in Argentina. <br/><br/>The Ohio State group has played a key role in the design, integration, commissioning, and management of the surface detector electronics chain and has played a leading role in the development of the detector trigger and the automated detector calibration scheme. Their analysis efforts benefit from their detailed understanding of the design and operation of the surface detector and they plan to continue their activities in support of detector operation and maintenance, and participation in the analysis of the Auger data. <br/><br/>The group has been active in engaging the public and providing opportunities for understanding the fascinating science involved in cosmic rays, by conducting tours of facilities both in the U.S. and in Argentina for schoolchildren and others. They are engaged in a program of education and outreach through a partnership with a local high school, where they are introducing students to cosmic ray research."
0.15,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>A broad program of research is proposed to elucidate the geometrical structure that underlies the internal dimensions of string theory, and to overcome key obstacles to extracting 4D particle physics from this geometry. The two main areas that will be investigated are warped compactifications and generalized geometry. Three additional areas include global embeddings of local models of particle physics, the string theory LHC inverse problem, and a cosmological model in which conventional string theory vacua arise from a more symmetric phase in the past. <br/>Intellectual Merit: Nearly all compactifications of string theory currently under sudy are warped compactifications. It is proposed to apply string duality to derive the precise effect of warping in the reduction to 4D, and to check nonperturbative corrections to warped compactifications. The first project is essential for reliably computing perturbative mass spectra in string theory models. The second will increase confidence in recent nonperturbative mechanisms for moduli stabilization and for the generation of hierarchically small Majorana neutrino masses and mu-terms. Another critical ingredient in moduli stabilization and inflationary scenarios is internal magnetic flux, now generalized to nongeometric flux. The nongeometric flux radically alters our understanding of the internal geometry by destroying the usual 6D interpretation of the extra dimensions as a manifold. A set of strategies is outlined to more precisely characterize compactifications with generalized flux, and to extract the 4D physics of D-branes in this background. Of the remaining three proposed projects, two further advance the goal of connecting string theory to 4D physics at the scale soon to be probed at the LHC. The last project provides a concrete realization of a long speculated idea that conventional string theory vacua describe a symmetry breaking phase of a more symmetric underlying theory. <br/>Broader Impacts: The PI brings the exciting frontiers of string theory and elementary particle physics to Bryn Mawr College. Supervised research will foster diversity in science and engineering, by building on Bryn Mawr's strong tradition of individualized research mentoring of talented undergraduate women (a quarter of whom are students of color) and coeducational graduate students, with a proven track record of recruitment and retention. The Ph.D. program, as a feeder to the faculties of regional liberal arts colleges, expands research activity in high energy physics. The plan exploits existing infrastructure: departmental colloquia, the Tri-College PACT seminar, and connections to the University of Pennsylvania. The PI will initiate a Theory Lunch and a visitor program tailored to the needs of a high energy theory program at a thriving liberal arts college."
0.248223,"In the fifty years since the discovery of quasars, a picture of these enigmatic objects has emerged wherein quasars are supermassive black holes residing at the centers of large galaxies. The black hole may have a mass of millions to billions times that of the sun. As this picture implies, the quasar phenomenon is one and the same as that of the objects referred to as ""active galactic nuclei."" All are characterized by enormous luminosity such that the quasar frequently outshines the light from all of the billions of stars in its host galaxy. Their extreme luminosity makes it possible to observe quasars located at billions of light-years from earth. Due to the finite speed of light, this means that astronomers can literally observe quasars at an earlier epoch in the universe, the age of the formation of galaxies. This project will specifically study pairs of quasars. Quasar pairs are relatively rare and are not physically associated with one another. Instead, they are a superposition of two quasars at different distances that appear close together on the sky. As the light from the more distant quasar passes by the nearer one, any gas in the halo of the galaxy hosting the latter quasar, the so-called ""circumgalactic medium,"" imprints a signature on the spectrum of the more distant quasar, allowing the study of the characteristics of that gas and giving clues as to the mechanism of the formation of the host galaxy. This team of researchers has assembled a sample of such pairs and will use them to study the circumgalactic gas as well as the gas between galaxies. The project will also support internship programs at a minority-serving college and public outreach.<br/><br/>This project is an extension of the well-established Quasars Probing Quasars project into several new scientific directions and support astronomical outreach into the Hispanic community of Salinas Valley. Specific scientific emphasis will be concentrated on the circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies, AGN physics, and the intergalactic medium at redshift of about 2. The project will utilize data from essentially every large-aperture, optical/near-IR telescope and will leverage state-of-the-art cosmological simulations to interpret results and test theories of galaxy formation, quasar feedback, cosmic re-ionization, and supermassive black hole evolution. The core of the project will be the use of pairs of quasars to probe the intergalactic and circumgalactic media at high redshift as well as to provide evidence for the resolution of fundamental questions in quasar physics. Typical quasar pairs are not physically associated with one another but the light from the background quasar is imprinted by material associated from the nearer, lower redshift member of the pair. This allows determination of the size of structure in any absorbing gas along with its density, mass, etc. Three distinct but coupled programs will be supported: (1) to test theories of galaxy formation by elucidating the properties of the circumgalactic medium around galaxies hosting quasars and sub-millimeter galaxies; (2) to estimate timescales for the active galaxy phenomenon using the transverse proximity effect; and (3) make the first measurements of the small scale structure of the intergalactic medium at redshifts around 2. This is an ambitious program for which the PI and his collaborators have the necessary physical resources (telescope time, etc.) and intellectual prowess."

This project will carry out high-resolution two-fluid simulations of AGN-heated cluster cores, including correct treatment of cosmic-ray pressure and buoyancy, turbulent mixing, and thermal conduction, as well as test-particle simulations of electron diffusion in turbulent magnetic fields, to improve previous approximate theories of thermal conduction. The investigation will rigorously test whether AGN heating solves the cooling flow problem, and will also show how to modify cluster-formation simulations to account for these two important heating mechanisms. This will lead to a better understanding of the relation between cluster masses and observables, and assist cluster surveys to constrain cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>The project includes junior researcher training, but also a major outreach effort through the University's Upward Bound Project, which targets low-income and first-generation students."
0.469346,"This project addresses the issue of how gas flows into spiral galaxies, a process essential to support the long histories of star formation in these systems. The PI and co-PI will use the adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code Enzo to carry out two series of simulations of gas flow into disk galaxies. The first series will consist of very high resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy halos similar to that of the Milky Way; the goal is to resolve the interface between the cold and hot phases of the gas and determine whether cold clouds condensing from the hot phase make their way to the disk. The second series will simulate a vertical column in and above the galactic disk, with the goal of determining whether and how thermal instabilities serve to channel the cooling medium into the disk. The code will also be used to construct simulated observations of emission and absorption lines arising in the cooling medium, for comparison with available spectroscopic data. The work will in part be performed by, and will include the mentoring of, a postdoctoral fellow. The postdoc, PI, and co-PI will participate in a program to train graduate students to visit middle schools to conduct interactive outreach programs, and visualizations constructed from the simulations will be made available for planetarium shows or other public venues."
0.711008,"Precisely how galaxies initially form and how they change throughout their lifetime are among the least understood problems in astrophysics. Many projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries. This project aims to provide the first robust census of gas-rich halos over a cosmologically significant volume and intends to provide important insight into how some massive galaxies maintain huge gas reservoirs without converting their gas into stars and how isolated low mass halos are able to retain some atomic hydrogen gas despite their fragile thermal state and shallow potential wells. This proposal is intended to conclude the already initiated survey, previously funded by NSF. The conclusion of the survey was understandably delayed primarily by telescope downtime but should conclude by the fall of 2012.<br/><br/>The survey is conducted at the Arecibo radio telescope and uses the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA), the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA). The survey has already produced results far exceeding the previous survey in this field, and the survey results will help to characterize the mass function of such halos and allow direct comparison with theoretical simulations of Universe in the current Lambda-CDM paradigm. ALFALFA, an extragalactic HI 21 cm line survey, will identify HI-bearing objects found over 7000 square degrees of the high galactic latitude sky out to z < 0.06. The public ALFALFA database includes HI line spectra and catalogues of HI line positions, redshifts, velocity widths, and flux densities as well as coordinates and cross-identifications in other digital data sets of the most probable optical counterparts.<br/><br/>This project has educational broader impacts as well. Graduate students will be intimately involved in all phases of the project, helping to plan and execute the observing program, developing software for data processing and analysis, producing public data products and interfacing with the Virtual Observatory, as well as undertaking their own science projects.

0.270063,"AST-0708284<br/>Statler<br/><br/>The primary conceptual bottleneck in our understanding of the formation of galaxies is feedback: the entropy and thermal energy injected into the protogalactic interstellar medium by stellar winds, supernovae, and accreting supermassive black holes. The first comprehensive survey of X-ray gas morphology in normal elliptical galaxies has shown that the gas is rarely, if ever, in hydrostatic equilibrium, but is being continually pushed about by modest outbursts from comparatively weak active galactic nuclei (AGN). It also revealed three new, fundamental correlations that constrain the thermodynamic state of the gas and its relation to AGN activity. This project will elucidate the hydrodynamic histories of elliptical galaxies, and constrain the physical nature of feedback, using these new correlations, coupled with detailed hydrodynamical simulations. These simulations will progress to increasing complexity, in order to isolate the effects of quiescent AGN feedback, merger-induced AGN feedback, and merger-induced star formation and supernova feedback. The results will contribute to the ability to perform realistic simulations of structure formation on cluster, supercluster, and cosmological scales.<br/><br/>The project supports a new collaboration between Ohio University and Los Alamos National Laboratory, helping to foster close ties between the national centers and academia. The associated graduate student will receive scientific and technical training in current research tools, including parallel computing.

The Higgs bosons represent the one aspect of the weak nuclear force about which essentially nothing is yet known. Yet, they are a very central aspect of our understanding of this force.

0.124,"9500672 Arnold This project will involve devising, improving, and analyzing methods for the numerical simulation of complex physical phenomena modeled by partial differential equations. A major emphasis will be on the modeling of thin structures (plates and shells). Specifically, an innovative new finite element method recently proposed by a team of computational engineers for plate bending will be analyzed and a new approach the investigator introduced in collaboration with Brezzi to develop and analyze new finite element methods for modeling the deformation of elastic shells will be pursued. This latter approach has produced the best theoretical results to date for avoiding the phenomenon known as membrane locking which has plagued shell computations. In addition to studying numerical methods and the errors they introduce, the investigator will consider the errors introduced by mathematical models of thin structures. Specifically, a new technique of analysis to study the convergence of two-dimensional models of thin plates will be used. This technique gives the possibility of obtaining sharp convergence estimates for plate modeling errors both globally and away from the lateral boundary (where convergence may be higher). It is hoped that this research will clarify in what situations the Reissner-Mindlin plate model affords better approximation than the classical Kirchhoff model, an important question that eluded resolution for decades. A second area of emphasis will be on the development, implementation, validation, and dissemination of a finite element code to simulate the collision of black holes. This problem involves the solution of the Einstein field equations on an unbounded domain in four dimensional space-time and is extremely demanding computationally. Work will focus, at least initially, on the solution of the initial data problem for black hole collisions, i.e., the determination of physical ly consistent and meaningful initial data. The initial data problem is a nonlinear elliptic system posed on an unbounded three-dimensional domain. For this problem the computer code to be produced will involve a variety of sophisticated modern techniques that have not yet been applied in computational relativity, including adaptive tetrahedral mesh generation and multigrid preconditioning. The investigator's work is directly related to several critical technological issues. It is generally agreed by practitioners that the current state of the art of numerical modeling of shells is inadequate, and this has been implicated in the failure of engineering structures such as stadium roofs and airplane fuselages. The investigator's work in both the area of the development and analysis of finite element methods for plates and shells, and on plate modeling errors is directed at overcoming these problems. The work on the simulation of black hole collisions is directly motivated by the ongoing construction of the LIGO gravitational wave observatory. LIGO is expected to be able to detect radiation from black hole collisions early in the next decade. Massive numerical simulations are needed to identify the cosmological events which are the sources for the detected radiation. It is clear that these simulations push the limits of available hardware and software technology. The investigator's work is directed at improving the speed and accuracy of these simulations by employing and adapting recent advances in numerical algorithms. The resulting computer codes will be adapted to parallel computer architectures and will provide an excellent opportunity for the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working under the supervision of the investigator to learn high performance computing techniques."

0.0403,"The research is in the areas of knot theory and 3- dimensional manifolds. One of the problems Thompson will work on is the property-P conjecture. A knot in the 3-sphere is said to have property P if no non-trivial surgery on the knot yields a homotopy 3-sphere. It has long been conjectured that all non- trivial knots in the 3-sphere have property P. Gordon and Luecke have recently shown that non-trivial surgery on a non-trivial knot cannot yield the 3-sphere itself. There remains the possibility that one could do surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere and obtain a counter-example to the Poincare conjecture. The suggested approach to this problem involves a generalization of work of Gabai on sutured manifolds, as well as considering the equivalent problem of whether one can do surgery on a knot in a fake 3-sphere and obtain S3. In addition, recent work with Scharlemann has suggested several interesting questions about imbedded finite graphs in 3-manifolds. Thompson will try to generalize their work characterizing unknotted planar graphs in S3 to arbitrary finite graphs in the 3-sphere. These are fundamental questions about three-manifolds. The fact that they are open points up how much we still do not know about three-dimensional manifolds. This is so despite the fact that we live in one, and so such topological questions might even have cosmological significance."

0.255,"The research supported by this award covers a wide variety of projects in general relativity, gravitational physics, and geometric analysis. A number of the projects are concerned with what Einstein's equations for the gravitational field tell us about properties of black holes. We hope to complete a proof that, in any spacetime dimension, black holes in equilibrium must have spatial symmetries. We also plan to continue a program of study of model astrophysical systems which are not in equilibrium: when can one identify such a system as a future black hole, and can one do this in a topologically closed universe? Other projects we are proposing involve mathematically probing the nature of gravitational fields near the Big Bang: is a curvature (tidal) singularity generally to be found near the Big Bang, and does the current support for oscillatory behavior seen in restricted families of cosmological models in fact extend to less restricted families?<br/>In addition to these projects involving general relativity, our proposed research includes studies of Ricci flow. This system of partial differential equations, which has recently played a major role in the proof of the Poincare and the geometrization conjectures, is a promising tool for further studies of the relationship between geometry and topology. We have had success in studying the stability of certain equilibrium geometries in Ricci flow, and we plan to extend this work to a wider class (including collapsing geometries.)"
0.154867,"A 3-manifold is a space where an object can move around in three distinct perpendicular directions. The universe that we inhabit is a 3-manifold whose global structure we do not yet understand. Thanks to powerful theorems by Thurston, Perelman, and Mostow, we do know that the geometry of a manifold (measurements of angles, distances, and curvature) is closely tied to its topology (an account of the different ways in which one may head off in one direction and eventually come back from another). However, we do not yet have a good quantitative understanding of exactly how geometric measurements determine topological structure and vice versa. A deeper quantitative understanding of this relationship can eventually be used to analyze cosmological data and shed light on the topology of the universe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project seeks to build and strengthen connections among the following perspectives in low-dimensional topology: combinatorial topology, hyperbolic geometry, quantum invariants, and group theory. This goal splits into several sub-projects. The first sub-project is to build explicit combinatorial models for hyperbolic 3-manifolds based on the combinatorial data of a fibration over the circle. The second sub-project is to use quantum invariants such as the Jones and colored Jones polynomials to gain information about the boundary slopes of knots, fibration data, and hyperbolic volume.

The origin of these key structures can be clarified through the interplay of new multi-wavelength survey observations and improved theory, essential for guiding and interpreting the observations. This research focuses on the growth of cosmic structure and on the two opposing effects of early, efficient star formation, and the quenching of this process in massive dark-matter halos, which together govern the formation of blue and red galaxies. This project should discriminate between galaxy spheroid buildup by cold gas inflows and disk instabilities and the alternative of major and minor mergers. The work should also identify the roles of nuclear activity versus virial shock heating in halos above a threshold mass, distinguish satellite from central quenching, and understand the cross-talk between the shutdown of star formation and the development of spheroidal stellar components and SMBHs. Detailed models of early-type galaxy formation will be compared with observations of mergers and other processes out to high redshifts, and also of nearby galaxies whose properties can be studied in detail. The work is supported by a large program of recently completed and planned follow-on computer simulations, using the most up-to-date cosmological parameters and having high mass and spatial resolution. Additional high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations will clarify galaxy formation processes and permit the calculation of kinematics, spectra and images, including dust scattering and absorption.

0.332514,"AST-0808099<br/>Brodie<br/><br/>Globular star clusters are powerful probes of the formation epochs, assembly mechanisms, and subsequent evolution of galaxies. This is because of the association of globular cluster formation with star-forming episodes in a galaxy's history, and because globular clusters survive as largely unaltered bright beacons, particularly in galaxy halos. Globular clusters are also simple stellar populations, and thus more easily analyzed and understood. To exploit to its fullest the unique ability of globular clusters to clarify outstanding issues, including the distribution of dark matter and the star formation histories of early-type galaxies, there must be a synergy between theoretical models and observations, particularly at low redshift where galaxies may be studied in suitable detail. This approach of galactic archaeology has recently been gainfully applied in the Local Group, and it is timely to extend it to distances of dozens of megaparsecs, and thus to a more representative cross-section of the Universe. This project will focus on two key areas: 1) Galaxy assembly and the role of dark matter, that is, how and when do the building blocks of galaxies combine, and 2) Stellar populations, that is, how and when do stars form within these building blocks? It involves an unprecedented systematic survey of the fundamental properties of globular cluster systems, and how they relate to their host galaxies, with a particular focus on early-type galaxies. This is the first constructive integration of globular cluster and galaxy research in a cosmological context.<br/><br/>This survey will couple innovative observations using a suite of the world?s most powerful ground-based facilities with a team of world-leading researchers spanning a wide range of sub-disciplines.

Since the gas is very tenuous and spatially extended, changes in the metallicity, temperature, kinematics and ionization state of the IGM can persist for long periods. Observations of the absorption caused by the IGM in the spectra of background quasars reveal the often-subtle signatures of the various astrophysical processes that cause such disturbances. This project will study the general structure of the gaseous cosmic web at high redshift, with particular emphasis on the interactions between galaxies and the IGM. High-quality, high-resolution observations of absorption systems will be used to search for the kinematic signature of interstellar and intergalactic winds, while data from closely spaced quasar lines of sight will be used to measure the small scale density field and to determine the turbulent energy and bulk motions. A large part of the effort will be aimed at taking an image of the general distribution of neutral hydrogen at high redshift by seeing the glow from the IGM.<br/><br/>The project includes multi-level educational and practical experiences for students, with particular emphasis on undergraduates from colleges in the Los Angeles area. Students will get first-hand experience of a working professional observatory, including observing trips with staff members to South America, and will be expected to complete a self-contained project."

Two complementary projects will (1) provide unprecedented detailed observational constraints on the extent, distribution, kinematics, and chemical and ionization conditions, of galactic halo gas, and (2) undertake an analysis of high-resolution simulations, both to interpret these data and to place constraints on various galaxy feedback recipes. The work will accumulate and analyze the highest quality quasar spectra and galaxy data from space and ground archives, as well as obtain additional critical data. Analysis of the simulations will create synthetic quasar absorption line spectroscopy to analyze in the same fashion as the observational data. Analysis of mock quasar spectra through cosmological simulation is a highly promising way to interpret the underlying temperature, density, and ionization structure of the halo/cosmic web interface, and the influence of galaxies on chemical enrichment.<br/><br/>The project includes an innovative state-wide networked science course designed to encourage under-represented students from the state of New Mexico to pursue technical careers.

First, he will seek to verify and extend the role of distant supernovae as cosmological probes through the spectroscopic and photometric study of supernovae discovered by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy and QUEST-2 surveys.

The clusters are chosen from a survey that combined 3.6-micron images from a 50-square degree survey with the Spitzer Space telescope with images from the ground at 900nm, to pick out the red sequence of old elliptical galaxies. These are some of the most distant galaxy clusters for which distances have been confirmed spectroscopically. Dr Wilson and her team will seek additional spectroscopy for about 50 galaxies in each cluster, calibrating the relation between cluster mass and richness for comparison with cosmological simulations of early galaxy formation. Additional optical images will provide a total of 10 color-bands in the optical and near-infrared, which will be used to estimate the rate of star formation (both dust-obscured and otherwise) and the stellar masses present in each galaxy. The PI also seeks near-infrared spectroscopy for more distant candidate clusters in the 'redshift desert' between 1.5 < z < 2; these would be the first confirmed clusters in this redshift range. This sample of clusters is especially valuable for comparison with models, because it is selected in a quantifiable way, but one that is different from that for X-ray-selected clusters.<br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by participating in the research.

0.341371,"The main topic of this project is Floer homology and related invariants in low-dimensional topology. Floer homology is an infinite dimensional version of Morse theory which has been used to construct various invariants of knots, 3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, etc. In turn, these invariants can answer subtle questions about the respective topological objects. One source of invariants with numerous topological applications is Heegaard Floer theory. For example, the Heegaard Floer invariant for knots (called knot Floer homology) is able to detect the genus of a knot. Originally, all the Heegaard Floer invariants were defined in terms of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symmetric products. Recently, the Heegaard Floer invariants of knots, 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds have all been given combinatorial descriptions, based on grid diagrams. One focus of this project is to improve our understanding of these combinatorial descriptions. The PI will also work on finding connections between knot Floer homology and other knot invariants, such as the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies; on extending Heegaard Floer theory to manifolds with corners; and on constructing new Floer-theoretic invariants of three-manifolds using moduli spaces of flat connections.<br/><br/>The proposed research is on topology, an area of mathematics that studies geometric objects such as curved spaces (manifolds), and knots in space. One useful method of studying manifolds and knots is through topological quantum field theories (TQFT's), which are certain toy models used in Mathematical Physics to explore quantum theories about the universe. TQFT's are of interest to topologists because they contain information about the possible shapes of space in various dimensions. An important problem is the classification of these shapes, and this is particularly difficult in four dimensions. Because our macroscopic space-time has four dimensions, the properties of four-dimensional shapes are an essential input for quantum physicists and cosmologists looking for geometric models for the universe. The goal of this project is to study the TQFT's which hold the most promise for our understanding of four-dimensional shapes."

The DASI instrument is currently providing measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation anisotropy over a range of scales that span the first three acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum. The shape of the power spectrum, in particular the spacing of the peaks, provides a potentially clean measure of the geometry of the universe. Other DASI studies include the measuring of currently undetected polarization of the CMB anisotropy. This information will provide a critical test of the early structure of the universe. Also, the receiver will be reconfigured for higher frequencies in order to measure the fine scale anisotropy and the tail of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum. Education and outreach efforts will proceed in parallel with DASI reconfiguration, testing, observing, and analysis; an undergraduate hands-on course on radio telescopes is being developed as part of this work, with a teachers workshop planned for the first year of this renewal.

The second project concerns finite group actions on 4-manifolds, with emphasis on the question of smoothability and methods of classification. The third project concerns nonorientable 4-manifolds and their exotic smooth structures. Manifolds are very natural geometric objects, being the locally Euclidean ones.

0.26185,"The potential for cosmological observations in the 21 cm line, using the Universe's phase transition from neutral to ionized hydrogen called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), has been widely recognized. The EoR, when the first stars, proto-galaxies and quasars emerged, is a very interesting time, because that object formation leads to patchy 21-cm brightness structure, which should be detectable today at redshifts near nine. Several large telescopes sensitive at meter wavelengths are already being used in attempts to detect and eventually map this patchiness. A great deal of theoretical work has been dedicated to predicting 21 cm signatures, and many groups are awaiting the first observational data. This project will use the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to observe the patchy neutral gas and thus pin down the timing of the reionization as well as the duration of the partially ionized era.<br/><br/>To achieve these astronomical goals, this study will continue a program of noise reduction at GMRT, including the elimination of terrestrial noise sources and the installation of lower noise amplifiers, which will benefit all users of the telescope. Additional benefits will come from the development of new signal processing techniques, from programs to make astronomy and physics more accessible to students and to the public, and from several programs specifically targeting high school students."

Observations suggest that supernova or AGN heating and gas cooling are significant for the formation of clusters and groups of galaxies. The SZE is a unique way to probe high-redshift low-density objects, complementary to observations of the X-ray luminosity. This is new and exciting science, from a modest research effort leveraged on existing investment in a nearly-completed interferometric array of telescopes, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA). Two cluster samples with measured central SZE decrement and total integrated decrement will constrain the linkage of X-ray luminosity to baryon depletion or to increased gas entropy. Understanding the relationship between cluster observables and cluster mass is invaluable for using clusters as cosmological probes.<br/><br/>This project primarily supports a graduate student, already involved in construction and deployment of the SZA, to pursue related thesis work and to continue an established relationship between the university laboratory and a local high school teacher and her students."

Secondly, optical depth effects and photon trapping will be added to simulations of early star formation, to try to make those studies more realistic. Finally, brightness temperature fluctuations due to the free-free contribution from the reionization epoch will be modeled in detail, for comparison to planned observations.

The research will be largely analytic, checked by comparison with cosmological N-body simulations. In ellipsoidal collapse, three numbers determine the fate of each halo: the local overdensity of dark matter, and two quantities related to the ellipticity and prolateness of the surrounding distribution of mass. Thus the abundance and the formation history of dark halos depend on the surrounding large-scale structure: the halo population in filaments of the cosmic web should be different from that in sheets and voids. Dr Sheth will calculate how ellipsoidal collapse should affect the relation between 2-point, 3-point and higher-order clustering statistics. The next generation of galaxy surveys will measure these quantities to within a few percent. This work is essential for interpreting those measurements accurately, to estimate the level of fluctuations in the dark-matter density and determine how its distribution differs from that of the luminous galaxies.<br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by participating in this research. Models of the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos are required to interpret measures of galaxy clustering and the baryon acoustic oscillation signal, and hence constrain the equation of state for the dark energy."

These interactions can be used as a probe of both ISM and ICM physics. A recent wealth of new data includes observed tails and wakes, and although simulations have shed some light, much remains to be understood, including a mismatch between the predicted and observed width of wakes, the way in which dense, molecular gas is stripped, and the fate of the stripped gas. To answer these questions, this project will increase the realism of stripping simulations, first by adding radiative cooling to idealized galaxies with constant density and velocity winds, using a high-resolution, adaptive-mesh refinement hydrocode. Secondly, those systems will be placed in realistic cosmological simulations of cluster formation and evolution. Finally, the team will add important extra physical processes such as viscosity, heat conduction and magnetic fields into their simulations.

This program operates in a single millimeter frequency band (26-36 GHz). .Recent measurements of the spectrum and the spatial anisotropy of the 2.7K CMB have dramatically improved our understanding of the early universe. The third characteristic of this radiation, its polarization, has not yet been detected. The amplitude of the linear polarization and its spatial distribution are extremely sensitive to both the source of the temperature anisotropy (density perturbations or gravitational waves) and the ionization history of the universe. The predicted polarization amplitude is less than or equal to 10% of the size of the COBE (Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer) anisotropy signals at 7o. The research team is using new receiver technology with 100 times more sensitivity than previous polarization experiments, as well as a novel instrument design.

0.726426,"Observing the metallicity and star formation history of galaxies since the earliest times in the universe is crucial to understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Theory suggests that metallicity changes less rapidly than star formation rate as a function of redshift, but there is no firm observational foundation for the cosmic metallicity history of star-forming galaxies. To address this, Dr. Lisa Kewley (University of Hawaii) will carry out a program to gain a simultaneous understanding of the metallicity and star formation history of galaxies between 0 < z < 3. This research builds upon the foundation laid by Dr. Kewley for diagnosing and interpreting the metallicity and star-formation properties of galaxies. The observations to be carried out in this program will: (1) impact the use of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) hosts as tracers of star formation and metallicity to high redshifts by determining the relationship between GRB hosts and the general galaxy population, (2) uncover the relationship between metallicity and large-scale structure using the unprecedented large area and completeness of new intermediate redshift surveys, and (3) provide a solid observational understanding of the cosmic metallicity and star formation history of galaxies. The observed metallicity history will be compared with predictions from semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, providing a critical test of our current theoretical understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.<br/><br/>This research will be incorporated into the University of Hawaii Active (inquiry-based) Learning Astronomy 110 class being developed by Dr. Kewley to engender an understanding of Hawaii's past and present role in astronomy. The research program will also be integrated into the University Hawaii Student/Teacher Astronomy Research (HI STAR) program, which targets years 9-12 native Hawaiian or other minority students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Dr. Kewley will develop for the HI STAR program a spectroscopy lab and galaxy evolution project and, with her research group, will mentor HI STAR students for Science Fair projects using spectra obtained as part of the research program. By promoting a solid understanding of spectroscopy and sharing the excitement of astronomical discovery, this program aims to strengthen the physics and astronomy background of underprivileged students in Hawaii, and motivate them to pursue a career in science."
0.357875,"AST-0707985<br/>Weinberg<br/><br/>Imaging and spectroscopic surveys of enormous galaxy samples, most notably the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have transformed the study of large scale structure, but the challenge of interpretation is that observable galaxy clustering reflects both dark matter clustering and the potentially complex bias effect between galaxies and dark matter. The Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework addresses this challenge by describing galaxy bias at the level of virialized dark matter halos, principally via the probability that a halo of a specified mass contains a given number of galaxies of a specified class. This project includes theoretical and observational investigations that will further develop HOD methods and apply them to measurements from the SDSS. The theoretical work will reveal the effect of environmental variations on the HOD, such as a systematic dependence of the galaxy content of dark matter halos on the large scale density field. The observational work is a coherent analysis and interpretation of the final SDSS galaxy redshift survey, drawing on correlation functions, group multiplicities, redshift-space distortions, void probabilities, galaxy-galaxy lensing, group mass determinations, and the large scale galaxy power spectrum. This analysis will yield HOD determinations of many different classes of galaxies, and cosmological parameter constraints that are tighter and better tested than traditionally obtained. It will shed new light on galaxy formation, the physics of inflation, the matter content of the Universe, and the nature of dark energy. The project includes some work on cluster-galaxy lensing as a tool for probing the growth of fluctuations and the evolution of the cosmic distance scale.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator serves as Spokesperson for the SDSS, responsible for fostering the scientific interaction and productivity of the SDSS collaboration and for promoting the SDSS to the astronomical community and the general public. This research provides indirect but crucial support to such activities, thus enhancing the scientific return from the SDSS and its role in education and public outreach. The project also supports graduate student training and the public presentation of astronomy in various forums."
0.332605,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/>Dr Zehavi will analyze and model the clustering of galaxies in large surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), to probe galaxy formation and the development of cosmic large-scale structure. She and others have shown that on small scales, dim red galaxies are more strongly clustered than brighter ones. This could be explained if the dim galaxies are satellites of more luminous galaxies, sharing their massive dark halos. Dr Zehavi and her team will test this hypothesis by examining much larger samples from the SDSS, and comparing the clustering properties of the dim red galaxies to those predicted for satellite dark halos by gravitational N-body simulations. The SDSS data will also be used to examine the distribution of satellite galaxies, comparing the observed anisotropic distribution with predictions from current models in which the satellites form in filaments of the cosmic web. She will use other surveys of more distant galaxies to examine how galaxy clustering has changed over the past 10 billion years of cosmic history. To do this, Dr Zehavi will construct a Halo Occupation Distribution model, which gives a statistical relation between the luminosity and appearance of a galaxy at a given time and the mass of its dark halo. The growth of dark halos can be followed in cosmological N-body simulations, so this model will provide a link between present-day galaxies and their probable precursors, billions of years earlier.<br/><br/>A postdoctoral scholar will be trained by participating in the research; undergraduate students will also be involved.

0.346967,"Dr Oh and his team will study the effect of newly-forming galaxies on the diffuse intergalactic medium, as the ultraviolet radiation from their young stars and active nuclei reionizes the gas. They will incorporate Monte-Carlo radiative transfer into the cosmological hydrodynamics code of collaborator Yoshida, and use this code to investigate how radiation pressure and the trapping of Lyman-alpha photons can regulate star formation and gas flow in early proto-galaxies. Several low-frequency radio telescopes now under construction will measure the redshifted 21cm radiation emitted by neutral hydrogen gas less than half a billion years after the Big Bang. Dr Oh and his team will develop better numerical algorithms and statistics to analyze these observations, and to remove signals from nearby objects. This will provide better measures of how the fraction of neutral gas decreases with time, and of the location and size of the regions ionized by nascent galaxies. The remaining neutral gas produces absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. This team will use simulations to derive an improved model that will allow better estimates for the time that hydrogen and helium were reionized, for the equation of state of the intergalactic gas at early times, and for the clustering of intergalactic gas clouds close to the present day.<br/><br/>Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained by participating in the research.

0.12,"This Collaborative Research is proposed by Klaus Kirsten, BaylorUniversity, and Paul Loya, Binghamton University. Casimir effect is a term used for quantum effects resulting from the finite extension of systems. The continuing miniaturization of technical devices makes this effect increasingly more important; e.g. in microelectromechanical systems it is responsible for up to 10% of the forces encountered. Also on cosmological scales this effect is relevant to the dark energy and to the stabilization of extra dimensions of the<br/>universe. However, presently not even the origin of the sign of the Casimir energy is well understood. In addition, the change of the Casimir energy is largely unknown when the shape of small objects and their material properties are altered. The goal of the present proposal is to considerably improve this situation by employing two completely different strategies. 1.) For highly symmetric situations, e.g. spheres, cubes and tori, the Casimir energy is well understood. Using contour integral methods this pool will be significantly increased to include configurations related to any separable coordinate<br/>system. 2.) At present, no practicable technique is known to find the change of the Casimir energy when the geometry of objects or their material properties are changed.<br/>This proposal entails a completely new approach. Analytical surgery, a geometric<br/>analysis method designed to analyze changes in spectral quantities, will be newly employed in the field of the Casimir effect.<br/>Broader Impacts. The deeper understanding of the Casimir effect is necessary<br/>for the optimal design of microelectromechanical devices. Furthermore this project will involve the collaboration of undergraduate and graduate students from various backgrounds and different departments. The techniques that the PIs will use to study the Casimir effect are accessible to advanced undergraduate students with a complex analysis background. An undergraduate text book and class on complex analysis, path integrals, and zeta regularized determinants will be developed by the PIs within the next two years. The newly established mathematical physics seminar at Baylor University started by Kirsten will serve to communicate results obtained under this grant to attract Baylor graduate students. Loya as the adviser of the Undergraduate Math Club at SUNY Binghamton will inform those students. This project will serve as a springboard to<br/>attract graduate students to this field of research to both involved universities. Finally, coming from the areas of mathematical physics (Kirsten) and analysis (Loya), the collaboration of the PIs in this project is multidisciplinary and will be a seed for new ideas combining physics and analysis."

Such ""megamasers"" --- so called because they are roughly <br/>a million times more luminous than typical masers associated with young stars found in the Milky Way --- are produced by excited H2O or OH molecules.

The number evolution of galaxies with time is not yet known, although it is likely to be an important element in the galaxy evolution process. This study will (1) establish the space density of OH megamasers from a broad OH spectral line survey of merging galaxies at the Arecibo Observatory, (2) determine the spatial scale of OH masing in these systems from a study of line intensity variability, (3) characterize the type of host most favorable to producing an OH megamaser from optical spectroscopy at Palomar Observatory, and (4) characterize the potential use of OH megamasers as indicators of merging galaxies at high redshift. <br/>***"
0.200106,"AST 95-00515 PI: J. Patrick Henry The study of rich clusters of galaxies provides much information of cosmological importance. They were the first places where dark matter was found. Their brightest member galaxies have been used as standard candles from the inception of modern investigations into the age and fate of the Universe. Despite their extreme importance, there has never been a catalog of clusters at high redshifts that could be used for objective statistical studies because most clusters are found from visual inspection of optical plates. Clusters of galaxies are also very luminous X-ray emitters, hence they are found in X-ray surveys of the sky. Further, finding clusters by their X-ray emission properties greatly reduces biases inherent in selecting them in the visible band while simultaneously providing a catalog with quantifiable characteristics suitable for statistical analysis. The most sensitive X-ray survey of an appreciable region of the sky is that performed by the German satellite ROSAT around the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). Work already performed under an existing NSF grant shows that the number of clusters at high redshifts in the X-ray data is as expected, and will in fact provide a sample of about the same size as that accumulated after decades of effort using optical techniques. This investigation will optically follow-up studies of the ROSAT NEP X-ray cluster sample with particular emphasis on the initial identifications of the clusters and later investigations of evolution of X-ray and optical properties, large scale structure, and the infrared magnitude-redshift diagram. The depth and completeness properties of the ROSAT sample will enable significant improvements to be made in these areas compared to previous studies. ***"
1.246027,"This is a renewal proposal to continue operating the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Array (AMANDA) at the South Pole Station through 2004-2006. The AMANDA uses natural 1.5-mile deep Antarctic ice as a Cerenkov detector. The telescope's effective area has reached 40,000 sq. m for the detection of point sources of cosmic neutrinos and exceeds 50,000 sq. m for gamma ray bursts at all zenith angles. The AMANDA detector has now operated for more than three years in its final configuration of 677 optical modules on deployed 19 strings. The detector collects approximately 4 terabytes of data yearly. These data are filtered at a high level at the South Pole and transmitted back to UW-Madison at a rate of about 3 gigabytes per day via the geostationary satellite systems and stored for further analysis and distribution to the AMANDA collaboration. Also stored are simulation data needed to analyze the experimental data. Presently 6 TB of AMANDA data is held online on large high availability RAID arrays. To enhance the quality of data management UW-AMANDA is taking the lead in adapting the DIF metadata standard to astrophysics. The scientific analyses in AMANDA can be classified as follows: (a) Atmospheric muon flux: the cosmic ray muon flux has been used to do a precision calibration of the detector with high statistics; (b) Atmospheric neutrinos: AMANDA's performance has been calibrated by reconstructing upward-going muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos. The detector, in steady operation, collects roughly four neutrinos per day using fast on-line analysis software. The atmospheric neutrino spectrum is now measured up to 100 TeV; (c) Cascades produced by the secondary electromagnetic and hadronic showers initiated by electron and tau neutrinos. The flux level is approaching where the much lower atmospheric neutrino fluxes should be observed, as well as the prompt flux from the decay of heavy quarks can be measured; (d) Search for point sources of cosmic neutrinos such as supernova remnants, mini-quasars, active galaxies; (e) Search for a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos; (f) Search for gamma ray bursts; and (g) Extremely high energy events from cosmological remnants or mini-black holes, magnetic monopoles, cold dark matter particles. The UW plays a major role in all analyses except for the last one. With the University of Delaware, the UW group determined that the fraction of heavy elements in the cosmic ray flux increases with energy in the region of the knee, by studying the muon response of AMANDA to air showers detected by the SPASE array deployed at the surface. The UW AMANDA group has pioneered many of the programs that are now part of the extensive IceCube education and outreach program including the Science in the Ice course that involves high school teachers and their students, as well as participants in the TEA (Teacher Experience in Antarctica) program."
0.162801,"The proposed research is on Floer homology and its applications to low-dimensional topology. Floer homology is an infinite dimensional version of Morse theory which has been used to construct various invariants of knots, 3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, etc. In turn, these invariants can answer subtle questions about the respective topological objects. One source of invariants with numerous topological applications is Heegaard Floer theory. For example, the Heegaard Floer invariant for knots (called knot Floer homology) is able to detect the genus of a knot. Originally, all the Heegaard Floer invariants were defined in terms of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symmetric products. Recently, knot Floer homology has been given several combinatorial descriptions. One focus of this project is to find combinatorial descriptions for the Heegaard Floer three- and four-manifold invariants as well. In other directions, the PI will work on finding connections between knot Floer homology and other knot invariants, such as the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies; intepreting the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies geometrically; developing Floer homotopy theory; and constructing new Floer-theoretic invariants of three-manifolds using moduli spaces of flat connections.<br/><br/>Floer homology plays a central role in the construction of topological quantum field theories. These are toy models used in Mathematical Physics to develop quantum theories about the universe. They are also of interest to topologists, who study the possible shapes of space in various dimensions. An important problem is the classification of these shapes, and this is particularly difficult in four dimensions. Floer homology and the associated invariants are some of the most useful tools for detecting properties of four-dimensional shapes. Because our macroscopic space-time has four dimensions, this is an essential input for quantum physicists and cosmologists looking for geometric models for the universe. Furthermore, recently Floer homology has found surprising applications in biology, more precisely in the analysis of DNA knotting."

0.209452,"This Small Grant for Training and Research (SGTR) supports development of a program to train graduate students in study of emerging technologies. Given the rapid pace of technological change in such areas as biotechnology and the new genetics, information technology and computing, and nanotechnology and materials, demand is increasing for a cadre of social scientists and humanists specializing in the study of the social dimensions of emerging technology. The SGTR will create a focus area on emerging technologies in Cornell's existing Ph.D. program in Science & Technology Studies (S&TS). This award will provide support for two students for three years. Students in the new focus area will participate in a new graduate seminar on ""Studying Emerging Technologies,"" take an advanced methods seminar, and take courses, participate in laboratory rotations, or engage in other activities to acquire appropriate technical knowledge. Each will conduct an empirical research project on an emerging technology that requires active engagement with the technical knowledge and help to organize and present an annual campus-wide panel discussion on social dimensions of emerging technologies. The program will also involve organizing an annual research workshop on studying emerging technologies. Unlike studies of any particular new technology, study of ""emerging technologies"" requires understanding a cluster of related issues: the complex deployment of ""revolutionary"" discourse; the intertwining of changing practices in laboratories, patent offices, and investment houses; the new ""practical cosmologies"" developed by technical workers as they embrace and extend technological revolutions; and the ethical complexities of conducting research about emerging technologies while often, because of ethnographic methodology, simultaneously participating in technological development. This project seeks to create a coherent training and research program integrating these issues into a coherent theoretical frame. The direct impact will be to train a particular cohort of two students per year in studying emerging technologies. Its broader impacts will include producing new courses on ""studying emerging technologies,"" ""archiving contemporary science,"" and other topics; sponsoring empirical research projects that, through presentation and publication, will contribute to wider scholarly discourse about emerging technologies; supporting campus-wide discussions between the scientific and technical communities and the science and technology studies community about the social dimensions of emerging technologies; and engaging individual faculty and students in the sciences and engineering in exploration of emerging technologies. Taken together, these activities will create broader awareness of issues associated with emerging technologies and will lead to wider integration of issues from science and technology studies into the work of scientists and engineers."

Dr. Crotts uses numerical models that simulate the reaction of gas to collapse dominated by cold dark matter. He is using both ground based and HST data for this work. Astronomers have detailed information about the two extremes in lookback time. At zero redshift (i.e., the present) we can measure the masses of galaxies, including how much material is gaseous. At very high redshifts the isotopic abundance rations set by the Big Bang determines how much gas existed at early epochs. In between these extremes lies a complex set of conditions that are addressed by the study of the Lyman alpha forest. The Lyman alpha forest is a dense set of spectroscopic absorption lines that cluster near the Lyman alpha break in the spectrum of quasars.

Thin film dynamics and the Van der Waals forces operating between thin layers are described by singular quasilinear equations of super-fast diffusion. The dynamics of population growth, polymer chain growth, including cross linking and high rate growth of biomolecules, are also non-linear phenomena amiable to our basic studies.

0.01199,"Under the direction of Dr. John Rick, MS Silvia Kembel will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will continue her archaeological fieldwork at the site of Chavin de Huantar, located in the highlands of Central Peru. Although the dates are not precisely known - their determination forms one aspect of MS Kembel's research - the site was occupied for over a millennium, from approximately 1,800 to 200 BC. Peru is one of the few areas in the prehistoric world where the transformation from hunting and gathering societies to empires took place and it has, therefore, provided a focus for archaeological attention. Scientists wish to understand the basic processes which underlay this cultural evolution. Chavin is particularly important in this context because it is the first center which spread its influence across most of the Andean region. Thus it laid the groundwork for the series of true empires which succeeded it, the latest and best known of these founded by the Inca. From the data available, it appears that Chavin influence spread not through direct physical conquest, but rather was ideological in nature. It may best approximate a powerful religious movement. The site of Chavin contains a large temple constructed primarily of stone. From the arrangement of the structure and `joins` between segments it appears that the temple was constructed in stages, perhaps over hundreds of years. In the Andes, buildings themselves serve symbolic functions and their shape and arrangement provide insight into cosmological beliefs. Therefore if one can reconstruct the construction sequence at Chavin and determine how temple form evolved over time, insight can also be gained into the belief system which underlay it. MS Kembel and her colleagues have developed a three dimensional computer mapping program which allows them to fix multiple points within the sprawling complex of chambers and galleries and to produce an accurate map. With these data and other information provided by iconography and contained archaeological remains, it will then be possible to set the structure into a chronological context. This research is important for several reasons. It will further develop a computer mapping technique of potential widespread archaeological utility. It will provide data about an important archaeological site and shed additional light on the process of Andean state development. It will also assist in training a promising young archaeologist."

These peculiar velocities are thought to be due to anisotropic gravitational forces that arise as matter in the universe becomes increasingly clustered over time. Thus, they can be used to test models of the formation of large- scale structure. Coherent peculiar motions over volumes many tens of megaparsecs in diameter are indicative of mass density fluctuations over comparable or larger scales. These mass fluctuations must be shown to be consistent with angular fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation if the standard Big Bang model is to remain internally consistent. The peculiar velocity field within the local universe can be mapped in sufficient detail to compare with theoretical predictions based on redshift survey data and thus provide strong constraints on the cosmological density parameter."

For the boundary reducibility problems, he will concentrate on the 1- bridge conjecture for surgeries on knots in handlebodies. For the reducibility problems, he will start by searching for more examples of exceptional Dehn surgeries, as this will hopefully lead to some intrinsic (probably even a complete) understanding of the reducibility of surgered manifolds. Also, he will study the cabling conjecture for surgeries on knots in 3-manifolds which contain a non-separating reducing sphere. Three-dimensional manifolds are very basic objects of geometric interest. They are spaces which have the local character of Euclidean 3-space but may be globally much more complicated. Examples in two-dimensions are easier to picture -- many surfaces are not the plane but would appear to be to ants crawling on them. Since we live in a 3-dimensional manifold, ignoring the time dimension, they are of cosmological interest as well, and there is a surprising amount not known about them."

0.012,"This dissertation research project focuses on the controversies surrounding William Herschel's observations on double stars, nebulae, and the planets. Herschel parted company with contemporary astronomers by attending to the appearance of celestial objects rather than to measuring their positions. As most eighteenth-century astronomers were equipped with small aperture refractors, rather than the large reflectors Herschel employed, many were unable to resolve the objects Herschel reported. The unconventional nature of Herschel's instrumentation and observing practices made it difficult for other observers to evaluate his claims. Were the stars he observed really double, or was their `doubleness` an artifact of his telescopes? Herschel sought to make his catalogue of double stars the test of the `goodness` of the telescope, but as the doubleness of many of these stars was itself in dispute, the debate over the meaning of resolution continued well into the nineteenth century. One way in which Herschel sought to convince other astronomers of the reality of his findings was to make reflecting telescopes for them, much as Galileo had done in the seventeenth century. While Herschel's commercial telescope venture is commonly treated as distinct from his `more important astronomical endeavors, this dissertation research project will argue on the contrary that the business is a crucial and unexplored dimension of his astronomy. By making telescopes for others, Herschel helped to ensure the acceptance and diffusion of his cosmological speculations. ÁÁ?Á? ?????¥?>?¥` Â?? ¥©Á ?>?Á¢¥?À/¥?? ¥? ¢¥Á? ???> Â??_ ©Á?

0.301454,"This project will make cosmological measurements of two distinctly different types. 1. The experimenters will make cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) measurements of the absolute brightness of the sky above South Pole at three frequencies, 1.0, 1.5 and 7.5 GHz. Similar measurements were made at the higher two frequencies from Pole in 1989, but the 1.0 GHz radiometer is new. The purpose is to determine if there are deviations from the CMBR temperature of 2.735 K which has been measured at higher frequencies, most notably by the new NASA satellite Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). Deviations, at different wavelengths, from the 2.736 K figure would indicate that there has been an input of significant energy into the universe since the time of the big bang. 2. They will attempt to measure microwave radiation coming upwards from the polar ice sheet, which is over two kilometers thick at South Pole. It has been hypothesized that extremely energetic neutrinos that have passed entirely through the Earth can interact in the ice, or rocks just below, and cause a electromagnetic shower that could result in detectable radio emissions. If this is true, then the polar ice sheet could be used as a vast detector for the new field of neutrino astronomy. This project is jointly funded by the Divisions of Polar Programs and Astronomy."
0.049768,"Technology has transformed the world. Yet technology affects society differently in different cultures. One needs only to examine the differences in housing, in heating systems, in appliances (even in toilets, as illustrated in the novel ""Fear of Flying""), in order to see how society shapes as well as is shaped by technology. In order to understand this interaction of technology and society, it is critical that we see these forces at work in a number of different settings. In this project, Professor Bray is investigating specific ways in which technological systems relate to various types of power relations and cultural features within a society, taking pre-modern China as an example. She stresses the role of technology as a cohesive force embodying relations of production as well as interacting processes of technological processes of technological, social, and cultural change. Historians of Western technology have brought considerable sophistication to such analyses, but these methods have not as yet been systematically applied to China. She is also applying approaches to technology developed by social and cultural anthropologists. Under this grant, the principal investigator is examining a restricted number of topics grouped around three thematic headings: divisions of labour (e.g significance of the household as the predominant unit of production; the contributions of women to production); culture mental and material (e.g. the implications of scarcity; how architectural forms reflect cosmological beliefs and social practice); forms of control and the exercise of power (e.g. water control; the importance of standardized measures; access to medical expertise). Eventually, Professor Bray hopes to develop this approach into a systematic treatment of technology in Chinese society and culture."
0.544112,"9732960 Devlin The main scientific goal of the research is to the study the anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The CMB is the photon remnant of the Big Bang. The observations of the fluctuations in light intensity of the CMB, and by analyzing the data, the fluctuations in the matter density of the universe at roughly 100,000 years after the big bang can be inferred and this information used to predict the present distribution of matter in the universe. The anisotropy in the CMB provides a key test of models of structure formation of the Universe. The knowledge of the sizes of fluctuations on different angular scales may allow the measurements of cosmological parameters such as the mass density of the universe, the expansion rate, and the baryon density. These parameters will enable us to learn about the universe today, its past, and its future evolution. The focus of the research is an aggressive plan to produce new results in CMB research. The plan is to combine the best aspects of ground-based and balloon borne experiments. The plan is to measure the spectrum of the anisotropy of the CMB on angular scales of from 0.15 to 4 minutes of arc with unprecedented accuracy. The technique of using ground-based observations has already been proven with previous measurements made in Saskatoon, Canada.. These measurements have very long integration times, but are limited by the poor stability of the atmosphere at the site. Balloon borne observations have negligible atmospheric interference, but are limited by integration time. A telescope built for a balloon measurements has been converted into the Mobile Anisotropy Telescope (MAT) which will be used to make observations from a high plateau (5,200 m) in Chile. The atmosphere is stable at this site and integration times can be extended for as long as necessary. The improvement in the measurements will require the use of state-of-the-art detector technology. A 115 element array of transition edge superc onducting bolometric detectors operating at 300 mK will be built for use with the MAT telescope. The array will to used to collect data which will yield independent measurements of the CMB anisotropy over a large fraction of the sky. The net result will be an improvement over the sensitivity of the Saskatoon data by an order of magnitude or more, and an increase in angular resolution by a factor of three. The other goals are to establish a new laboratory for (CMB) research, to develop a research program that incorporates undergraduates and graduates, and to play a central role in developing an astrophysics curriculum. The curriculum will range from courses for general undergraduates and astronomy/astrophysics majors to courses for graduate students. Major progress has already been made along each of these directions. Data on the CMB with a balloon borne telescope has been obtained. Undergraduates will be able to use a newly established laboratory. The undergraduate students will come from a variety of backgrounds, including physics, mechanical engineering and computer science. The development of a new astronomy course for non-majors will be exciting and instructive for both the faculty and students. The plan is to extend the scope of the research and education activities by initiating an outreach program with the City of Philadelphia high schools which will provide area students with supervised projects in observational astronomy. ***"
1.775285,"Research is proposed that can make an important contribution to the question: Do neutrinos have mass? The answer to this question is important to our understanding of our Sun and other stars, which are prolific emitters of neutrinos, to cosmological questions about the existence of dark matter, thought to make up must of the universe, and to particle physics in understanding the relationship of the neutrino to other elementary particles. If neutrinos have mass, the known three types of neutrinos can oscillate, one into another, given enough time- depending on their energy. In this case the produced neutrinos have sufficient time to oscillate, traveling 730 km. through the earth from Fermilab to a detector equipped mine (Soudan) in Minnesota."
0.40475,"Abstract - Nemiroff The universe we live in changes continually, but most changes are not easily observed. The planned projects will have a focus on some of the few areas of astronomy where significant change occurs on easily measurable time scales. The study of change may brings clues which have far reaching implications - from the better understanding of the nature of dark matter to the better understanding of the nature of high energy environments. The temporal nature of humanity's understanding of our universe lends itself nicely to public outreach efforts and educational programs. Programs on the following topics will be carried out: Gamma Ray Bursts: The temporal aspects of gamma-ray bursts will be further explored. Previously, there was the successful detection of the existence of time-dilation in gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The precise amount of time-dilation. however, is still unknown by almost a factor of 1.5. The effort will be to work toward increasingly accurate calibration of this important attribute with regard to different samples, systematic errors, and the amount expected from calibration to best-fit cosmological brightness distributions (Log N - Log P). Definitive resolution of the GRB distance scale debate would occur were a gravitational lensing signature isolated. The search for lens detection in GRB data will be extended to all GRB data as it becomes available. The search for new hard GRBs in the BATSE data stream will be extended. Gravitational Microlensing: The temporal aspects of gravitational microlensing will be further explored. Previously, there was success in quantifying the success rate of microlensing (MACHO) searches before results were reported, and predicting the usefulness of finite source lenses in determining the nature of the lenses. Currently, the microlensing searches are entering a new era - one where common single lens, point source events have only statistical value. More complex events, such as those involving binary lenses and finite sources, have become increasingly important as they give more direct evidence of the mass, velocity, and distance to the lens. The effort will continue to study how best to deconvolve mass, distance, and velocity using multiple lens and finite source size effects. The mass and density of Galactic lenses currently implied is controversial and goes to the heart of the Galactic dark matter problem. The effort will include the use of computer simulations to better study which microlensing measurements best deconvolve mass from the amplitude and duration of finite source events, predict which type of MACHO surveys would yield best information about the density and composition of our Galactic halo, and scrutinize public domain data for finite source size effects and implications. Astronomical Debates: Disputes at the forefront of astronomy also change. Two successful astronomical debates have been staged. These modern debates act a natural platform for the teaching of astronomical subjects and for public outreach. Three more debates are planned. Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD): As the universe changes daily, so does APOD. Each day APOD will display a different astronomically oriented picture on the World Wide Web along with a heavily hyperlinked description. In its 1.5 year existence, APOD has acquired many thousands of readers and has been praised by magazines including The New Yorker. APOD' s archive now contains many of the most famous astronomy pictures. APOD's use in education is shown by it popularity in astronomy class home pages, and its outreach potential by the high access rate from the businesses domain. The APOD's will be expanded, to create an outreach program for cooperating U.S. universities, and to directly incorporate student interns in APOD's daily routine."
0.144219,"In 1978, William Thurston revolutionized low-dimensional topology by<br/>demonstrating that many 3-manifolds have hyperbolic metrics.

A tremendous<br/>number of results have come out of these ideas. The goal of this proposal<br/>is to further understand hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In particular, there are a<br/>set of invariants that come out of the cusps of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and<br/>hyperbolic knots, including the cusp volume, the meridian length and the<br/>longitude length.

0.380708,"Though their field was once thought to be reasonably well-understood, astronomers in the massive-star community are now faced with a number of new and fundamental questions about the non-spherical character of stellar mass loss. The nature and extent of wind clumping remains an unsolved problem; recent studies suggest that due to this clumpiness, O star mass-loss rates should be revised downward by an order of magnitude or more. In addition, a growing body of evidence shows that magnetic fields can influence the geometry of mass loss in hot star winds in unanticipated ways. The effects of stellar rotation on the structure and formation of disks around some main sequence and post-main sequence massive stars are still not fully understood. Meanwhile, detailed observations of supernovae reveal that many more core-collapse objects interact extensively with aspherical circumstellar environments than previously realized, and signatures of this interaction may be mined for clues to the mass-loss histories of massive supernova progenitors. <br/><br/>This project is a comprehensive study of clumpy and aspherical structures in the circumstellar media of massive stars and supernovae. Motivated by access to high-resolution spectropolarimetric data and using an established Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, Drs. Ignace and Hoffman, and their team, will construct simulations of variable line and continuum polarization in the stochastically clumped winds of Wolf Rayet, luminous blue variable, and O stars; in the disks and rotating magnetospheres of other active stars; and in core-collapse supernovae interacting with their immediate environments. They will also develop algorithms that will allow the modeling code to simulate line polarization arising from the Zeeman and Hanle effects from the circumstellar fields of magnetized stars. The investigators have broad experience in both radiation transport techniques and interpreting spectropolarimetric observations of hot star winds and interacting supernovae. By confronting detailed 3D models of these systems with multiwavelength and polarimetric data, the goal is a better understanding of how the mass-loss history of main-sequence and evolved massive stars can be extracted from their observation and those of core collapse supernovae. <br/><br/>The project includes a unique outreach program, Promoting Careers in Science, through which Drs. Ignace and Hoffman will each implement innovative strategies for improving science education and literacy in their respective communities. Dr. Ignace will reach out to school counselors to enhance science education among Appalachian middle- and high-school students. Dr. Hoffman will partner with the University of Denver's Women's College to create new entry points into the scientific career 'pipeline' for non-traditional female undergraduate students. In addition, Dr. Ignace will continue supervising undergraduate research projects both through East Tennessee State University and through involvement in an REU site program. The bulk of the 5-year funding will go to support the training and professional development of a postdoctoral researcher at East Tennessee State University and a graduate student at the University of Denver who will be trained in the theoretical modeling of radiation transfer."

0.473029,"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br/><br/><br/>The California-Boston AstroStatistics Collaboration is developing a new model-based strategy for statistical inference that embeds computer models into multilevel models that explicitly account for complexities of both astronomical sources and the data generation mechanisms inherent in new high-tech telescopes. The resulting highly structured models must be fully utilized in order to learn about the underlying astronomical and physical processes. This strategy requires state-of-the-art scientific computation, advanced methods for statistical inference, and careful model checking procedures. The Collaboration has a track record using these methods to solve outstanding data-analytic problems in astronomy. In addition, the PIs (van Dyk, Meng, and Yu) have substantial research experience in developing the methods that the Collaboration will extend, employ, and publicize: inferential and efficient computational methods under highly-structured models that involve multiple levels of latent variables and incomplete data. Such models are ideally suited to account for the many physical and instrumental filters of the data generation mechanism in high-energy astrophysics. The five astronomers (Chiang, Connors, Kashyap, Kelly, and Siemiginowska) all have expertise on the instrumentation and science of high-energy and/or optical astronomy, and, all have collaborated with statisticians in efforts to develop appropriate methods to address scientific questions. The collaboration specifically aims to develop a mixture of parametrized and flexible multi-scale models that can be combined with complex computer-models to describe spectral, spatial, and timing data, either marginally or jointly. The models are developed in a fully Bayesian framework that allows us to incorporate external information, provide coherent estimates of uncertainty, and calibrate statistical comparisons of proposed underlying physical models. These methods require the Collaboration to develop new sophisticated statistical computing techniques for Monte Carlo exploration of complex and often multi-modal posterior distributions.<br/><br/>In recent years, technological advances have dramatically increased the quality and quantity of data available to astronomers. Newly launched or soon-to-be launched space-based telescopes are tailored to data-collection challenges associated with specific scientific goals. These instruments provide massive new surveys resulting in new catalogs containing terabytes of data, high resolution spectrography and imaging across the electromagnetic spectrum, and incredibly detailed movies of dynamic and explosive processes in the solar atmosphere. The spectrum of new instruments is helping scientists make impressive strides in our understanding of the physical universe, but at the same time generating massive data analysis challenges for scientists who study the resulting data. The complexity of the instruments, the complexity of the astronomical sources, and the complexity of the scientific questions leads to many subtle inference problem that require sophisticated statistical tools. For example, data are partially missing, are subject to varying measurement errors, and are contaminated with irrelevant artifacts. Scientists wish to draw conclusions as to the physical environment and structure of the source, the processes and laws which govern the birth and death of planets, stars, and galaxies, and ultimately the structure and evolution of the universe. Sophisticated astrophysics-based computer-models are used along with complex mathematical models to predict the data observed from astronomical sources and populations of sources. The California-Boston AstroStatistics Collaboration aims to tackle outstanding statistical problems generated in astrophysics by establishing frameworks for the analysis of complex data using state-of-the-art statistical, astronomical, and computer models. In so doing the Collaboration will not only develop new methods for astronomy but will also use these problems as a spring board in the development of new general statistical methods, especially in signal processing, multilevel modeling, computer modeling, and computational statistics."
0.05,"This proposal focuses on the study of coadjoint representations and related algebraic structures related to coadjoint orbits. These coadjoint representations play a fundamental role in understanding certain aspects of the Anti-de Sitter Space / conformal field theory conjecture as well as understanding such diverse topics as black hole quantization and conformal field theory. The research will focus on understanding the Virasaro algebra arising in string theory and its dual (the coadjoint representation). By considering the semi-direct product of the Virasoro algebra and the Kac-Moody algebra, two symplectic structures of classical mechanics can be obtained which are important for quantizing the theory. The resulting action can be used for describing quantization about BTZ black holes as well as for studying Chern Simons theory. A toy M theory will be studied based on a particular N=1 Virasaro action."

0.07,"The proposal seeks support to complete the analysis of data from the QUaD experiment located at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in 2005-2007. QUaD is a 31-pixel polarization-sensitive bolometric camera mounted on a 2.6 meter Cassegrain telescope, which was making maps of the polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation on angular scales from 5 angular minutes to 2 degrees. Recently released results from the first season of observations (2005) improve any previous results obtained by individual small angular scale experiments. A second successful season of data taking (2006) is now complete and data are in an advanced state of the analysis. The third observational season (2007) just completed and the data are undergoing initial checks, characterization of ground spillover and mitigation of its effects by appropriate filters in Fourier space. As processed and analyzed, these data will produce most precise measurements of the CMB polarization spectra in the multipoles range 200-2000. This will permit a detailed test of whether scalar fluctuations in the early Universe were adiabatic as predicted by the simplest inflationary models, or whether there were significant amounts of isocurvature fluctuations. QUaD also serves as a pathfinder for many of the modern observational techniques that will be needed by future experiments, probing systematic effects that must be confronted in the quest to detect the faint polarization signature from tensor modes."
0.26752,"Dr Voit and his team will explore the conditions under which the hot diffuse gas of a galaxy cluster can make a transition to inhomogeneous cooling and star formation. The results may explain why galaxies do not grow indefinitely large. Analytic calculations will explore how the thermal stability of the hot gas depends on the entropy gradient. These linear calculations will be used to test a hydrodynamic code that has been modified to include thermal conduction. That code will then be used to explore the nonlinear growth of instabilities, producing models that can be compared with X-ray observations of real clusters. Simulations will test how long cool gas stripped from galaxies can survive as such in the hot cluster medium, and compute the expected optical spectra from those wisps of dense gas. Simulations will be run from both spherically-symmetric and cosmologically-generated initial conditions. Dr Voit and his team will then investigate how including thermal conduction, magnetohydrodynamic effects, and energy fed back into the cluster gas by active galactic nuclei in the calculation would affect the results. The team will also obtain optical images of the central regions in a sample of nearby galaxy clusters that have been studied in X-rays, to explore how star formation in and around the central galaxy is related to the state of the hot cluster gas. <br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by participation in the research. Dr Voit and collaborator Dr Donahue have a strong record of both graduate and undergraduate student training.
