Anions play an important role in various environments and have many applications in technology and fundamental research. Among these applications are not only common products such as smoke detectors, but also much more sophisticated devices, including fusion reactors (devices that transform the mass of light atoms into into electricity and which may be a major source of clean energy for the second half of the 21st century). Anions play an important role in semiconductor technology and have important implications for the space industry since they have been found in interstellar space and the atmospheres of large planets. Despite its importance and many uses, the formation of anions is poorly understood. This is because the process involving collisions of electrons with molecules is difficult to describe theoretically. In some situations, it is possible to overcome the lack of theoretical understanding by doing the appropriate experiments. However, experiments are expensive, especially if no theoretical guidance is available. An example is the use of anions in plasmas, where experiments are expensive because of the extreme temperatures needed for fusion to occur. The aim of this research is to understand and model the process of molecular anion formation in relation to the interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres, and technology development. The proposed research program is a cross disciplinary effort involving astrophysics, planetary science, and plasma physics. The project will answer the question of how observed molecular anions are formed in cold plasmas (such as in the interstellar medium or upper atmosphere of planets) and also how fast they are formed and destroyed. The project will develop theoretical methods that could be used by the scientific community to study other similar processes. <br/><br/>This project addresses a number of atomic and molecular physics problems related to elementary processes in molecular plasmas. Molecular plasma evolution and decay are governed by collisions between electrons and molecules (or molecular ions). Understanding such elementary processes is important in studies of laboratory plasmas, planetary atmospheres, and the interstellar medium (ISM). It also allows one to develop tools for modeling, monitoring, and controlling plasmas, which is crucial for technological applications such as semiconductor etching or tokamak plasma wall protection in the divertor region. The project is mainly devoted to the study of the formation of negative molecular ions by radiative electron attachment (REA) and dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The study is motivated by a recent detection of negative ions CnH- (n=4,6,8) and CnN- (n=1,3,5) in the ISM. It was suggested that these ions (except, maybe, CN-) are formed in the ISM by REA. Recently, a fully-quantum method to calculate the REA rate coefficients was developed in the group and applied to study REA in CN-. A very low rate coefficient for REA formation of CN- was found. For larger molecular ions, the fully-quantum method will likely give rate coefficients that are also small, which would mean that the observed ISM abundance of the ions cannot be explained by REA. One goal of the project is to adapt the developed fully-quantum method to other observed molecular ions: The REA mechanism of negative ion formation will be studied using first principles. It is likely that results of this study will lead to a revision of the accepted mechanisms of anion formation in the ISM. Later, the developed methods will be applied to study several problems in the chemistry of anions and cations in the interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres, and laboratory plasmas. In particular, the question of whether the dissociative or radiative mechanism of anion formation in the ISM is more efficient will be addressed. The project will contribute to the development of plasma-related databases, in particular, those used for modeling magnetic fusion devices, planetary atmospheres, spacecraft re-entry, and interstellar medium."

The solar atmosphere is a chaotic stew of such arched magnetoplasma structures that cover broad spatial and temporal scales. The tiny ones are the size of California; the Earth would be barely noticeable inside a big one. The arched magnetoplasma structures efficiently confine plasma until they become unstable and erupt. Some of these eruptions drive extremely intense energetic events that influence systems and technologies in orbit and on Earth. To get insight into the eruption processes, highly reproducible arched magnetoplasma eruptions will be generated and studied in a laboratory experiment at UCLA. In addition, collaborative efforts between plasma and solar physicists will be initiated to enhance the impact of this project in broader areas of physics. This project will also provide educational opportunities to high-school students and train a graduate student towards his/her doctorate.<br/><br/>Contemporary models of solar eruptions attempt to explain initiation and evolution of arched magnetoplasma structures on the Sun. It is difficult to test these models by solely relying on constraints provided by remote observations, especially since key elements (such as magnetic-field and plasma flow in the corona) are not directly measured. In this project, a series of specially designed laboratory plasma experiments will be conducted to simulate the eruption of arched magnetoplasma structures under a variety of scenarios on the Sun. These experiments will provide data with a high spatio-temporal resolution in three dimensions and will have the flexibility of testing a variety of models of solar eruptions, such as dynamic injection of magnetic flux into an arched magnetoplasma and slow-storage of magnetic energy driving a fast eruption. The arched magnetoplasma will evolve in a large background plasma produced by another source. Thousands of identical eruptions will be routinely produced and their evolution will be recorded using movable diagnostic probes and a fast CCD camera. To complement these studies, remote observational results on solar eruptions will be compared with the laboratory results for few selective cases. These research efforts are expected to contribute to a wide range of topics relevant to the Sun such as coronal mass ejections, loss of equilibrium due to force imbalance in an arched flux rope, and excitation of waves and oscillations in the solar atmosphere."

Plasma processing has become indispensable in a wide range of applications where high performance materials with tailored surface properties are employed. Moreover, development of new plasma surface modification processes and deposition chemistries is a burgeoning area with impact on biomaterials, coatings, and sensor applications. A more complete understanding of the underlying chemistry in these systems could lead to manufacturing improvements with economic impact across many industries. Thus, the goal of the proposed work is to improve understanding of the fundamental chemical processes that occur at surfaces during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and surface modification of polymers. Professor Fisher and her students will achieve this goal through an integrated, comprehensive approach to understanding the molecular-level chemistry in these systems. The primary experimental tools to be employed are in situ sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and the laser-based imaging of radicals interacting with surfaces (IRIS) technique, which provides steady-state surface interaction data for plasma species. The SFG experiments are designed to examine the evolution of plasma modified films upon exposure to atmospheric gases to study labile intermediates formed in plasma modification, thereby elucidating mechanisms involved in aging and hydrophobic recovery processes. <br/><br/>Plasma processing is used to prepare high performance materials with tailored surface properties. These materials are used in many fields and industries including computational science, information processing, data management, sensor fabrication and communications. In this project, Prof. Fisher and her students will use a combination of experimental tools to study plasma processing. The results will enable the development of new materials and the improvement of existing ones. The intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of this research will afford students a broad exposure to and education in chemistry, engineering, and materials science, beyond the traditional boundaries in chemistry. Professor Fisher will continue her efforts in broadening participation of underrepresented groups and use the proposed experiments to develop demonstrations of plasmas and lasers for visitors, high school groups and K-12 teachers."

Our understanding of the atmospheric microplasmas and the nature of the plasma interaction with biological matter is very limited. In this project, we will, in particular, advance the knowledge of atmospheric microplasmas relevant for medical applications. This research program will serve as a vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of plasma science. The PIs will make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority students in this project by working closely with the relevant student organizations at George Washington University. To recruit women, the Society of Women Engineers will be contacted and informed of the project activities. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research through the Work Study program or a Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement. The experience will impart them with the knowledge and the skills to excel in independent academic or industry careers they pursue after completing their education. The educational plan for this project also aims to generate interest in science and technology in the area of plasma science and bioengineering and to reach out to K-12 teachers, school children and their parents.

The award provides funds to support undergraduate participation in the overall research effort, which is being funded separately by the DOE under contract to Princeton University contract (Grant Number TBD)."" <br/><br/>Broader Significance and Importance: Plasmas formed from focused laser beams provide reactive heated volumes of gas, somewhat analogous to the sparks produced by conventional ignition systems. Laser plasmas, therefore, are of interest for a number of applications including ignition. We will develop the basic plasma science to provide tailored laser pulse schemes for ignition and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) applications. In terms of combustion, laser ignition has many potential benefits. For reciprocating natural gas engines one can ignite leaner mixtures (reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation) and higher pressure mixtures (leading to higher engine efficiencies and fuel-savings). In aerospace applications one can achieve better relight in aero-turbines. The multi-pulse approaches may lower the burden on required laser sources and fiber delivery implementations. We will present our activities to local minority-serving public schools (K-12) and include research advances in courses at our universities. We will specifically target underrepresented or minority groups to work on the project as their Ph.D. thesis research.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The proposed research focuses on innovative approaches employing pre-ionizing pulses (ns-ps-fs) to enhance and control laser plasma formation in gases. In particular, we will examine cases in which an initial pulse is used to achieve pre-ionization, and is followed by a second pulse that provides controllable energy addition. The energy addition of the second pulse is enabled by pre-ionization due to the first pulse. The result will be a laser plasma that is not at full breakdown conditions (i.e. no spark), but that has elevated temperature (>~2000 K). Such laser plasmas can provide novel and improved ignition sources by avoiding the unnecessarily high temperatures, strong shock waves, and elevated laser pulse energies that accompany full laser breakdown (sparks). We will consider a range of pulse durations (ns-ps-fs) as well as both non-resonant and resonant schemes for pre-ionization. We will also study both non-resonant pre-ionizing pulses as well as Resonant Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) schemes. The REMPI schemes will be developed for future applications in air with initial studies in synthetic gas mixtures, e.g. we will study REMPI of argon and oxygen which are abundant in air. The plasmas will be experimentally studied and characterized as well as modeled numerically. We will determine optimal laser pulse parameters (wavelength, duration, temporal separation etc.) to provide sufficient pre-ionization and to allow subsequent energy addition. Owing to the lack of visible emission, the study of such plasmas is challenging and a key feature of our proposal is the use of a newly developed microwave scattering technique to measure electron parameters. The proposed research will be transformative in terms of laser plasma formation; despite a large body of research in laser breakdown using single laser pulses there has been minimal research on multi-pulse approaches and pre-ionization. The three-year program will be conducted by Colorado State University (CSU), University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK), and Princeton University (PU) and combines experimental studies, advanced diagnostics, and computational plasma and combustion modeling."

Plasma assisted materials processing is largely responsible for the impressive progress that continues to be made in production of microelectronics devices of ever increasing capability. Plasma etching is the only known, industrially implementable method to fabricate the nanometer sized features in logic and memory chips. During plasma etching, fluxes of ions and neutral particles are directed towards the wafer being processed. The energy and angle of impact of the particles onto the surface of wafers are the critical parameters for the fabrication of microelectronic devices, as well as nanostructured and biocompatible materials. Control of these parameters allows for finer control of the surface composition and, in microelectronics fabrication, etch rate. Low temperature plasmas for plasma materials processing have traditionally used continuously excited plasmas. However, all major semiconductor chip and equipment manufacturers are predicting that pulsed plasmas will be the enabling technology for achieving sub-10 nanometer feature sizes. The most direct impact of this research is addressing fundamental science issues that are of paramount importance to the plasma processing of high performance microelectronics, nanostructures and biocompatible materials. In addition to the technological broader impacts, this project will be highly focused on educational outreach. Prof. Gekelman is one of the founders of LAPTAG (Los Angeles Physics Teachers Alliance Group) and several LAPTAG students and will be involved in these plasma processing studies. Prof. Kushner, director of the Michigan Institute of Plasma Science and Engineering, will leverage those resources to launch the Plasma Picture of the Day website with the goal of providing informative images of plasmas to educate the general public and school children about plasmas.<br/><br/>The lack of fundamental understanding of the dynamics of pulsed plasma systems is the current impediment to widespread adoption. For example, instabilities and waves are nearly universally observed in pulsed plasmas, and particularly in electronegative plasmas, which sometimes prevents operation in desirable parameters spaces. The sources of these instabilities and the means to prevent them are not understood. Pulsed plasma processing can be arbitrarily complex. For example, modern capacitively coupled plasma etching tools may be driven by up to 3 separate power supplies at different frequencies which can be pulsed independently at different repetition rates and different duty cycles. The combinations of parameters can number into the millions. This extremely large parameter space places a large premium on having a fundamental understanding of pulsed plasma processing and so be able to predict plasma performance. In this research project, a highly collaborative experimental-modeling effort will investigate the fundamental properties of pulsed plasmas as used in materials processing, with an emphasis on instabilities and waves, diagnosing and modeling the dynamics of the transition from interpulse afterglow to powered plasma, and the means to improve uniformity through pulsing. Laser induced fluorescence will be used to characterize the trajectory of ions as they are accelerated through the transient sheaths produced by pulsed plasmas; and will be correlated with Langmuir probe measurements of plasma properties. Multi-dimensional computer modeling will be validated by these measurements and will be further used to illuminate fundamental issues related to plasma transport in pulsed systems."

Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimental students learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theory students can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program.

The physics issues will be studied with experiments at Berkeley and at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, Vlasov codes and 3D Particle-In-Cell codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics.

A better understanding of meteor plasma dynamics and its radiowave scattering characteristics is needed in order to be able to utilize the information that radars generate about meteors.

In-situ data and new analysis techniques will both be employed to measure the low charge states of heavy ions for the first time, revealing previously undetected ICME core material. The science objectives aimed with this project are highly relevant to topics that are central to the SHINE community. A fundamental part of the research work integrates the expertise of young scientists at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor with the professional training of seasoned researchers. In addition to providing the community with a comprehensive list of in-situ observations of cold ICMEs, this work will also provide a thermal history of the plasma involved. Future models by the community will be constrained and improved by these plasma results. By including researchers at the undergraduate level in several of the data analysis tasks, this work will also act as a tool to educate and give experience to the rising generation.

The Michigan Ionization Code (MIC) will be used to predict charge state evolution in the filament in order to: (i) investigate the formation of higher charge states and the survival of low charge state ions during the eruption process; and, (ii) reconstruct the energetics of erupting filaments, including the temperature, density, and velocity evolution of the plasma from launch to the freeze-in point.

The study will utilize observations at the six NSF radars (and associated lidars), as a diversity of frequencies, viewing angles relative to the geomagnetic field, and latitudes/seasons is required to determine the whole earth meteoroid mass flux, explore the head/trail-echo scattering mechanisms, and to reveal details of the meteoroid interaction with the atmosphere including fragmentation, ablation, sputtering, and the resultant plasma physics and aeronomic effects. The complex role of the meteoroid mass flux to the Mesosphere & Lower-Thermosphere (MLT) on the aeronomy and electrodynamics of this region as represented by, e.g., sporadic-E, sporadic metal layers, and Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes (PMSE), remains an illusive and even unrecognized component of space weather. Detailed understanding of the radio science of the radar head/trail-echo radar scattering processes is required to correctly interpret how the plasma surrounding the meteoroid--and that then forms the meteor trail--is generated and evolves, thus revealing important insights into sputtering, fragmentation, and terminal processes. Details of these processes remain a source of controversy. The investigators will also study how the meteoroid metals arrive in tidal ion, sporadic-E layers, noctilucent clouds, and PMSE. Modern high-power, large-aperture (HPLA) radar meteor observations have greatly stimulated the entire field of meteor physics and associated aeronomy. Observational and modeling/simulation studies of the radar meteor head/trail-echo scattering processes provide unique insight into meteoroid interaction with the atmosphere and also into the contribution of meteoric ions and ""smoke"" to the ionospheric D- and E-regions. The observations will provide details on how the meteoroid plasma trail evolves into geomagnetic field aligned plasma structures and will explore the surprising and instructive meteoroid flare generated plasma waves that produce non-thermal radar scattering. Together with radar observations, Rayleigh and metal lidar results provide a new dimension to meteoroid flux aeronomic studies. The meteoroid flux into the MLT is linked to solar system and local galactic processes. These are ""systems of systems"" space weather issues where meteoroid energy dissipation heating of the upper atmosphere is of the same order as Joule and particle heating of the auroral zones--an apparently unrecognized property of the meteoroid flux. This study will also lead to the development of new radar imaging techniques and help address issues such as the role of the meteoroid mass flux in many lower atmospheric processes such as cloud formation and stratospheric chemistry. Exploration of meteor-related electrodynamics and non-equilibrium plasma physics may stimulate other areas of research in, for example, the ionospheric heating community. This research will involve both graduate and undergraduate researchers, featuring discovery and learning to communicate knowledge concerning the meteoroid processes, related spaceweather and systems issues, and associated aeronomy."

From stellar nurseries to the Earth's ionosphere, plasmas represent a fourth state of matter that is the most common form of matter in the visible universe. Moreover, a phenomenon known as a ""dusty"" or ""complex"" plasma is formed when charged particulate matter, such as dust or ices, becomes incorporated in the plasma environment. In space, phenomena such as in comet tails or the rings of Saturn are examples of dusty plasmas. Closer to Earth, control over particulates in plasmas are important in high-technology and microelectronic fabrication. In both astrophysical and technological plasmas, the presence of magnetic fields can have a profound influence on the properties of the plasma. This research project supports a new, state-of-the-art, multi-user, superconducting, high-magnetic device to understand the basic properties of a strongly magnetized plasmas and magnetized dusty plasma. The intellectual merit of this work is that it will enable the study of new regimes of plasma physics and dusty plasma physics that have not been accessible in previous experiments. The main project goal is to investigate how the structural, thermal, charging, and stability properties of a dusty plasma evolve as the system is taken from an unmagnetized state through a progression of regimes where first the electrons, then the ions, and then charged microparticles become magnetized.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work is substantial. This project is a direct collaboration among three US universities (Auburn University, The University of Iowa, and University of California-San Diego) that perform leading research in the field of dusty plasmas. The researchers from these three organizations will coordinate a broad team of collaborators representing universities, national laboratories, and international partners. And, this project will provide excellent opportunities to train the next generation of plasma scientists through the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as providing partnerships with dusty plasma researchers at predominantly undergraduate institutions."

Most of the light reaching Earth originates at the 'surface' of the sun, a region called the photosphere. However, the regions of the solar atmosphere immediately above this surface, the solar chromosphere and corona, create most of the dangerous Ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation. These regions also generate the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that pass the Earth at speeds in excess of 400km/s. Both the rapidly changing radiation and the solar wind create hazards for spacecraft, astronauts, and have a number of important terrestrial impacts. A long-standing mystery has prevented scientists from understanding and accurately modeling the chromosphere and corona. A short distance above the 'surface' of the sun, the solar atmosphere's temperature jumps up by a factor of two to three. The goal of this project is to provide an explanation of the origin of this heating. The project will also provide opportunities to recruit and train student researchers in plasma and solar physics, simulations, and modeling at the Boston University. Many of the Boston University PI's undergraduate research advisees, about half of whom are women, have continued on to graduate school. <br/><br/>This research will examine whether solar plasma flows emerging from the photosphere can transfer sufficient energy into turbulent plasma of the solar atmosphere, which, in turn, will heat the chromosphere sufficiently to explain whether the observed UV spectra originate there. It will also evaluate whether this mechanism can account for chromospheric spectral observations. This requires four linked research tasks: (1) solving for plasma drifts and fields when a convecting neutral gas pushes it across magnetic field lines; (2) analyzing the theory of streaming instabilities applicable to the collisional plasma found there; (3) performing a series of kinetic simulations to explore the nonlinear and thermal properties of the resulting turbulence; and (4) incorporating the resulting electron heating into a radiative transport code in order to evaluate its impact on chromospheric radiance. This research combines several research areas encompassed by the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Science and Engineering."

Nearly a half of the manufacturing steps necessary to fabricate a computer microprocessor employ plasmas. The interaction of plasmas with materials depends on the region close to the surfaces known as the plasma sheath. Better understanding of sheaths will lead to improved microprocessor fabrications and might be essential in achieving controlled fusion.

The specific questions that will be addressed are: 1. What are the details of the newly recognized instability-enhanced collisional friction? 2. What happens to the anisotropy of ion velocity distribution functions (IVDFs) along the presheath and at the sheath-edge? 3. Why do experimental transverse IVDF results differ from simulations? 4. Are the ions in three species weakly collisional plasmas all lost at the system sound velocity when they have comparable densities? 5. Are there separate presheaths associated with ion-neutral collisions and oblique magnetic fields? 6. How do sheaths and presheaths at dielectric and mixed boundaries differ from those at conductors? 7. Does the sheath disappear or not when a small electrode is biased to the plasma potential? Coordinated studies of these phenomena will be carried out at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of San Diego. Experiments will determine the presheath and sheath plasma potential profiles and the resulting IVDFs associated with ion acceleration. Most of the experiments will be carried out in Madison and led by the PI Prof. Noah Hershkowitz.

Astrophysical collisionless shocks will be mimicked in the laboratory using high-powered lasers. This will allow their properties to be studied in a detail not currently possible by observing them in space. Collisionless shocks in space affect the particle and field distribution throughout the universe and are believed to be the primary source of cosmic rays.

Collisionless coupling between the debris ions and ambient plasma accelerates the ambient ions to super-Alfvenic velocities and a self-sustained shock can separate from the laser-plasma piston and propagate through the ambient plasma over large distances. The shock will be characterized by measuring the jump of density, magnetic field, temperature and flow across the ramp in a variety of shock geometries. These experiments could potentially launch quasi-parallel (i.e. Alfvenic) shocks and find evidence of particle acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting for the very first time.

This work will advance our understanding of organic gas-liquid reactions in electrical discharge plasma where the liquid droplets are exposed to the plasma environment under ambient temperature and pressure conditions such that they are not evaporated. The research involves the synthesis of a wide range of organic compounds starting with saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon liquids that are sprayed into the reactor as small droplets. The pure organic droplets will flow into the low temperature and low power plasma where vapor and interfacial reactions occur. In the case of saturated hydrocarbons, hydroxylation reactions to form alcohols will be investigated with emphasis on hydrocarbons with 6 to 10 carbons. Hydroxyl radicals will be formed from small amounts of water and or hydrogen peroxide vapors added to the flowing gas stream. In the case of unsaturated hydrocarbons hydrogenation reactions will be investigated with hydrogen mixed in an argon carrier. Unsaturated hydrocarbons with 6 to 10 carbons as well as selected oils will be studied. In both cases selectivity and yields will be analyzed as functions of the various reactor properties including gas and liquid flow rates and composition, pulsed input power and frequency, and electrode geometry. The general working hypothesis that will be tested and analyzed is that reaction selectivity and yield for plasma reactions of organic compounds from organic liquid droplets can be controlled through variation of plasma and reactor operating conditions. It is anticipated that the reaction products that are soluble in the organic liquid phase will be favored through a mechanism found previously for hydrogen peroxide generation from liquid water droplets whereby liquid soluble products preferentially accumulate in the liquid phase where they are protected from plasma degradation in the surrounding gas. In general, the project seeks to develop a new way to introduce functionality into organic compounds in the liquid phase through spatial and temporal control of the plasma.<br/><br/>This project will develop fundamental knowledge on how plasma in gas-liquid environments leads to the formation of various synthetic organic compounds. Understanding of how such reactions occur is important for the design and operation of chemical reactors that can be used in practical applications to make many useful compounds. For example various alcohols can be made from hydrocarbons in such systems, and this work will have impact on a range of other applications of plasma processes used in material and chemical synthesis and fuels processing.

Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community, due to the fact that dust and ionized gas are found in most space environments, including the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings, and noctilucent clouds in the earth's ionosphere. Dusty plasmas are also present on Earth in applied settings. They are formed in the chemically active gases used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield. Dust contamination within fusion devices is also an issue, since dust produced through erosion of the containment walls raises both safety (operating instabilities) and health (long-term contamination) concerns. The formation of dust crystals, clusters and strings in laboratory plasmas has also proven to be a capable analog for atomic and molecular systems. <br/><br/>Charging of dust grains is a unique and important aspect of dusty plasmas. Understanding the physics behind this charging and subsequent formation of dust structures immersed within plasma has proven to require nuanced details. The charge acquired by the dust grains is determined by the plasma environment, but the charged particles in turn influence this environment. Local variations in the charge, either over the surface of a single dust grain or the multiple dust grains comprising a larger structure, can affect both the grain's local dynamics and the evolution of the overall system. Many situations introduce asymmetries into this problem, making the charge difficult to describe analytically. Complicating factors include variations in space (due to geometry of the dust structure or of the plasma environment) as well as variations in time (due to the response of the plasma to the moving dust grains or stochastic charging processes). The dust charge is also extremely difficult to determine in experiments. Thus, the primary objective of this research is to determine how variations in charge in both time and space influence and respond to the dynamics and configuration of dust particles in plasma environments.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish this goal, numerical modeling techniques will be combined with laboratory experiments to provide a proper understanding of the processes governing the system behavior. Numerical models will be used to model temporal and spatial charge variation over the dust structures, including stochastic effects to resolve the variations in time due to the discrete nature of the plasma particles. The charging will also be linked to numerical models of the plasma environment which define the response of the plasma to boundary conditions and the dust itself. Simultaneously, laboratory experiments will employ state-of-the-art techniques to control and confine the dust within dust clouds, strings, clusters, and aggregates in order to use them as in situ probes to measure the local plasma environment."

Plasmas are often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids, and gases) and account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. Since plasmas are charged gases, they serve as excellent conductors of electricity, and thus are of great practical interest. As an example, plasma engines have been developed by a number of space agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, the use of plasmas within nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently of immense scientific interest. Other notable examples of plasmas include the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, and comet tails. A complete understanding of the solar wind would also be particularly useful, as this natural phenomenon dictates the intensity of ""space weather"", which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting the Earth. In general, the motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated partial differential equations dictated by physics. Among the goals of the current project are to demonstrate that these equations possess realistic solutions, determine their qualitative behavior, compute their sensitivity with respect to model parameters (such as masses, charges, and temperature), and computationally approximate them so that one can accurately predict outcomes in future situations.<br/><br/><br/>A plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are often strong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting, collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the Maxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity averages of solutions to the Vlasov equation. One major question this project will study is: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as in lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity variables), smooth global solutions are known to exist. Similarly, the associated Fokker-Planck system will be studied to further elucidate the smoothing influence of collisions on the particle distribution. Another problem to be investigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge density and electromagnetic field in the system. More specifically, do dispersive effects in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient interaction so as to sustain their strength even as time tends to infinity? Finally, the sensitivity of fields and densities with respect to model input parameters will be computed using global sensitivity metrics and particle-in-cell simulations."

A beam of light can put pressure on things to force it to move. Normally, this force is too small to see, but if a laser beam is bright enough and the objects have a small weight, it is possible to see these effects. In this project, we will look at how controlling the shape of a pulse of laser light can make it easier for this force to get electrons moving fast. We will also look at how these laser pulses can make strong waves in a plasma, where the electrons and ions become separated by another laser pulse. Our pulses of light are so short (a fraction of a trillionth of a second) that the ions left behind don't have time to move. The electrons accelerate in the laser pulse like a surfer on a big water wave, where she chooses just the right angle to ride the wave. We hope to show that this can lead to a new way to make beams of electrons traveling near the speed of light. The work should also help us understand how we can use these laser pulses for making small channels and for eye surgery. It will also show us how to convert these pulses to other colors of light. <br/><br/>The research aims to explore using spatio-temporally structured intense laser pulses to control both ionization and electron dynamics in laser-produced plasmas. By controlling the transverse and angular distribution of the frequency components of the beam, we can control the spatio-temporal structure of a pulse. Important for this project, the angular spatial chirp results in an intensity envelope that is tilted relative to the direction of propagation. This gives us control of the transverse group velocity, which can range from super- to sub-luminal. We will use this control to affect the dynamics of electrons and waves in the plasma. In the free electron regime we will test our calculations that predict that with the proper pulse front tilt angle, electrons can be captured and accelerated to the side by the ponderomotive force of the beam. Such a configuration could ultimately be useful for direct acceleration of electrons to the MeV range, useful on their own or as an optical injector for wakefield accelerators. In the underdense and overdense plasma regime, the tilted pulse fronts can enhance the generation of waves in the plasma. In the latter case, we will perform a series of experiments to explore coupling of ultrafast pulses to surface plasmon waves. Our projects closely couple experiment, theory, and computational modeling. The experiments will be performed at CSM with our kHz repetition rate Ti:sapphire amplifier. Computational modeling will be performed with the open source 3D EM PIC program Epoch and with the finite-element Comsol Multiphysics platform."

Undergraduate research experiences in this small college environment tend to provide more comprehensive research skills training than comparable experiences at larger institutions, thereby contributing in significant ways to developing the future workforce in technical fields.

Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics.

Furthermore this proposed work will increase the exposure of the general public and future graduate student to the exciting and interdisciplinary field of plasma engineering.<br/><br/>This proposed research experimentally investigates micro- and nano- scale discharges in liquids. By using nanosecond duration voltage pulses, nanoscale electrodes, and a high density medium such as a liquid, plasma discharges as small as 10s-100s of nanometers in size can be created. Such systems are very complicated with various effects of the plasma generation including: electrophoresis, shock waves, radical species generation, non-equilibrium conditions, light emission, high pressures and high temperatures. The temporal evolution of the thermodynamic state in the small discharges will be measured and manipulated by voltage pulse control to emphasize desired effects for a particular application. Diagnostics will include sub-ns temporal resolution microscopic visualization, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), Schlieren imaging and hydrophones. The experimental results will be correlated with analytical and low-order models comparing the system to existing theories on underwater electrical and laser induced breakdown. These results will be tied into developing course material, and disseminated to students, the general public, and research peers. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The hypothesis of this research is that nanoscale plasma discharges can be created to accentuate various physical, chemical, radiative, or thermal effects by controlling the electrode size, and voltage application. This study of miniscule discharges in high density fluids pushes the limits of current low temperature plasma physics to smaller sizes and higher electron densities. Diagnostic techniques will also be developed in this new regime. Proof of concept tests for some potentially transformative applications will also be explored such as: the chemical analysis of attoliter volumes of liquids; intracellular surgery and diagnostics; maskless nanopatterning; bottom-up nanofabrication; and hydrodynamic flow control. Future potential applications of these unique small size, high energy density, and luminous systems are: nanoscale thermonuclear devices; sub-wavelength visible and UV light sources for near field optical techniques; electro-optical interconnects and, yet unexplored quantum confinement effects in nanoscale plasmas.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The study of such plasma liquid interaction and their applications is important as it is a new regime of plasma physics ripe for new technologies and discoveries. Similarly the nanoscale manipulation of materials and processes is also important. The proposed research focuses on very fundamental aspects, mechanisms and applications with nanoscale plasmas. As a novel system it also has potential for new commercial applications. To enhance educational impacts this proposal will: 1) train and exposure undergraduate, master and doctoral students in the cross disciplinary field of plasma engineering, 2) develop a new undergraduate course on Plasma Engineering including laboratory demonstrations, 3) develop a workshop and seminars on nanoscale plasmas and plasmas in liquids for several international meetings, 4) focus on increasing graduate school participation of domestic students including the underrepresented, and 5) create You-Tube and Wikipedia content to excite and inform the general public about plasmas."

As such, blazars provide a direct view of how energy is radiated away and degraded in and around fast moving plasmas. Unfortunately, the current explanations have proven inadequate. This research team has introduced a new model that looks very promising in initial, approximate, studies. This project will use new computational techniques to simulate the motions of large amounts of high-speed plasma, to study the problems in sufficient detail to distinguish between the possible alternatives by comparing with astronomical observations. The research tool developed for this work will be packaged for others to use in many areas of plasma science.<br/><br/>Blazars are the primary sources of persistent extragalactic gamma-ray radiation detected by ground- and space-based observatories. They provide a direct view of dissipation and radiative processes in relativistic collisionless plasmas. Recent observations of rapid intense flares imply that the emitting regions are very compact and propagate with much higher Lorentz factors than the bulk jet values deduced from radio observations. A semi-analytical model using localized, relativistic sub-flows, called minijets, has reproduced the main features of flaring blazars, but is based on crude approximations. This project will use a new, fully radiative Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code to study collisionless reconnection in relativistic plasmas, including the effects that plasma magnetization, the strength of the magnetic guide field, and the plasma composition, can have on bulk plasma motions, particle acceleration, and radiative signatures. Simulated time-dependent spectra will be compared to existing data. The puzzling gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula cannot be due to shock acceleration or any other magnetohydrodynamic process, and this research team's comprehensive model is the first compelling case for reconnection as the main dissipation mechanism in a distant astrophysical system. The present work will study the bulk kinematics of relativistic reconnection outflows, the effects of plasma composition on reconnection outflows, and radiation processes in these self-same outflows. These will be the first kinetic simulations to model relativistic reconnection in an electron-ion plasma, and among the first to treat radiative losses self-consistently.<br/><br/>The powerful research tool used here will be made freely available, with all necessary documentation, test problems, diagnostic tools, and sample scripts. The study itself applies widely not only to other astrophysical systems such as pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray bursts, and accretion disk coronae, but also to space physics applications and laboratory plasmas.

Dusty plasmas have long been of interest in the astrophysics community, due to the fact that dust and ionized gas are found in most space environments, including the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings, and noctilucent clouds in the earth's ionosphere. Dusty plasmas are also present on Earth in applied settings. They are formed in the chemically active gases used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield. Dust contamination within fusion devices is also an issue, since dust produced through erosion of the containment walls raises both safety (operating instabilities) and health (long-term contamination) concerns. The formation of dust crystals, clusters and strings in laboratory plasmas has also proven to be a capable analog for atomic and molecular systems. <br/><br/>Charging of dust grains is a unique and important aspect of dusty plasmas. Understanding the physics behind this charging and subsequent formation of dust structures immersed within plasma has proven to require nuanced details. The charge acquired by the dust grains is determined by the plasma environment, but the charged particles in turn influence this environment. Local variations in the charge, either over the surface of a single dust grain or the multiple dust grains comprising a larger structure, can affect both the grain's local dynamics and the evolution of the overall system. Many situations introduce asymmetries into this problem, making the charge difficult to describe analytically. Complicating factors include variations in space (due to geometry of the dust structure or of the plasma environment) as well as variations in time (due to the response of the plasma to the moving dust grains or stochastic charging processes). The dust charge is also extremely difficult to determine in experiments. Thus, the primary objective of this research is to determine how variations in charge in both time and space influence and respond to the dynamics and configuration of dust particles in plasma environments.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish this goal, numerical modeling techniques will be combined with laboratory experiments to provide a proper understanding of the processes governing the system behavior. Numerical models will be used to model temporal and spatial charge variation over the dust structures, including stochastic effects to resolve the variations in time due to the discrete nature of the plasma particles. The charging will also be linked to numerical models of the plasma environment which define the response of the plasma to boundary conditions and the dust itself. Simultaneously, laboratory experiments will employ state-of-the-art techniques to control and confine the dust within dust clouds, strings, clusters, and aggregates in order to use them as in situ probes to measure the local plasma environment."

Avalanches are sudden events that cause major changes over an extended region of a physical system. Although the concept is commonly associated with catastrophic ""snow avalanches"", the general phenomenon occurs widely in both natural and artificial systems. A typical driver and source of energy for an avalanche is a sharp change in one of the parameters that describes the underlying system. This project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical study of avalanches triggered by a steep slope in plasma temperature and density across a magnetic field. This is a situation widely encountered in natural plasmas, such as in magnetic field structures on the Sun and around the Earth, and has to be accounted for in any design of a magnetic fusion device. The project will involve a graduate student who will gain a unique perspective on modern experimental techniques and will also participate in theoretical and numerical modeling work.<br/><br/>To date, the majority of experimental information about avalanche transport in a magnetized plasma has been obtained in devices designed for fusion studies. However, due to the complexity of these devices, it has proven difficult to unravel the underlying physical mechanisms of the process. This project aims to significantly expand the experimental knowledge base by exploring the behavior of a well-defined plasma configuration that exhibits repeatable, controllable avalanche events. The data obtained in the experiments will provide quantitative information about the role of self-organized criticality dynamics, the formation and evolution of streamers, the effect of flows and flow shear, and the manifestation of nonlocal transport of both temperature and density. These topics are at the frontier of plasma science and are the subject of numerous ongoing theoretical and computational studies."

In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth."

Earth's magnetic field lines are ""frozen"" into the plasma and thus are entrained in this convection. Of particular interest, the feet of these convecting magnetic field lines thread the ionosphere (a layer of charged particles in the Earth's upper atmosphere) at high latitudes and set the ionospheric plasma into motion as well, forming patterns of convection that change as the solar wind changes. At lower latitudes the ionospheric plasma co-rotates with the Earth. Disturbances in the solar wind associated with stormy space weather strengthen the convection in the magnetosphere, which has the effect of expanding the convection pattern in the ionosphere equatorward into regions where previously the ionospheric plasma was co-rotating. This project aims at improving knowledge of the portion of the expanded convection pattern in the mid-latitude region, where observations have previously been sparse, using a set of newly built radars. This is crucial to understanding space storms and their effects at Earth. The improved convection patterns from this project will enable a broad spectrum of new research. This geoscience postdoctoral fellowship will support the further training of an early-career scientist. It will also ultimately result in more accurate space weather models of value to society.<br/><br/>To accomplish its goals, this project will use the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), which is a primary tool for constructing the high-latitude convection pattern and its variability. Recently SuperDARN expanded its coverage in the northern hemisphere by adding nine mid-latitude radars and three polar cap radars to better resolve these sections of the convection pattern.

The waves are excited and measured in a large laboratory plasma with local magnetic fields produced by strong permanent magnets and current-carrying coils. Wave propagation, wave refraction and reflection, standing waves and nonlinear effects are obtained from detailed measurements of three vector components of the wave magnetic field in three dimensional space and time. The findings are expected to produce a new understanding of wave effects in space plasmas and to improve industrial plasma sources for plasma processing.<br/><br/>Specifically, whistler wave propagation will be studied near magnetic X- and O-type null points, magnetic neutral sheets and dipole fields with high mirror ratios.

Under those circumstances, different group and phase velocities are possible and complicate the wave propagation. The experiments produce complete data sets that provide valuable insight for the understanding of whistler-mediated reconnection, whistler eigenmodes on closed field lines, and whistler wave reflection at the lower hybrid frequency layer as well as whistler modes near lunar crustal magnetic fields, whistlers in small toroidal plasmas, and in helicon and magnetron discharges.

Vacuum glass is like a flat and transparent thermos bottle for windows. Vacuum glass has three times less heat loss than triple pane glass but costs no more to manufacture. This disruptive value proposition will drive rapid market penetration, regardless of energy price, and without the need for government subsidy. This project will produce vacuum insulating glass that will enable R-10 windows, consistent with the goals and schedule of the DOE Windows Roadmap. Immediate benefits include improved occupant comfort and reduced heating bills without thermostat setback. Furthermore, vacuum windows will be condensation-free and fog-free forever. The potential impact is huge. Buildings represent 40% of total U.S. carbon emissions. Near-universal use could reduce total U.S. energy use by 3% (about 3 quadrillion BTU/year), while adding no cost to building infrastructure. Germany, Japan, Australia, China, and Russia have vacuum glass development programs; a successful development under this project will ensure that the U.S. stays at the scientific and technological forefront of this technology, and participates in a large and growing market.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will develop the use of plasma degassing to achieve a vacuum life beyond 20 years, a condition for private investment. Without adequate degassing, moisture attached to internal surfaces is trapped at the time of seal-off. Trapped moisture molecules will later outgas, causing vacuum decay. Traditional high-temperature bakeout is too costly for affordable vacuum glass. Bakeout takes hours, but plasma degassing takes minutes. A German vacuum glass development effort tried plasma degassing under vacuum, which is inefficient. In contrast, this project will use atmospheric pressure plasma degassing, which is both faster and cheaper. Building on lessons learned during the Phase I project, a plasma treatment protocol will be developed to produce VIG panes as large as 25% of the average residential window size. Working in parallel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will work to optimize the insulating performance of the design to enable an R-10 window for the DOE Windows Roadmap. Thereafter, an integrated pilot line will be assembled, able to produce vacuum glass units suitable for meaningful retrofit projects.

Laser plasmas, therefore, are of interest for a number of applications including ignition. We will develop the basic plasma science to provide tailored laser pulse schemes for ignition and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) applications. In terms of combustion, laser ignition has many potential benefits. For reciprocating natural gas engines one can ignite leaner mixtures (reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation) and higher pressure mixtures (leading to higher engine efficiencies and fuel-savings). In aerospace applications one can achieve better relight in aero-turbines. The multi-pulse approaches may lower the burden on required laser sources and fiber delivery implementations. We will present our activities to local minority-serving public schools (K-12) and include research advances in courses at our universities. We will specifically target underrepresented or minority groups to work on the project as their Ph.D. thesis research.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The proposed research focuses on innovative approaches employing pre-ionizing pulses (ns-ps-fs) to enhance and control laser plasma formation in gases. In particular, we will examine cases in which an initial pulse is used to achieve pre-ionization, and is followed by a second pulse that provides controllable energy addition. The energy addition of the second pulse is enabled by pre-ionization due to the first pulse. The result will be a laser plasma that is not at full breakdown conditions (i.e. no spark), but that has elevated temperature (>~2000 K). Such laser plasmas can provide novel and improved ignition sources by avoiding the unnecessarily high temperatures, strong shock waves, and elevated laser pulse energies that accompany full laser breakdown (sparks). We will consider a range of pulse durations (ns-ps-fs) as well as both non-resonant and resonant schemes for pre-ionization. We will also study both non-resonant pre-ionizing pulses as well as Resonant Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) schemes. The REMPI schemes will be developed for future applications in air with initial studies in synthetic gas mixtures, e.g. we will study REMPI of argon and oxygen which are abundant in air. The plasmas will be experimentally studied and characterized as well as modeled numerically. We will determine optimal laser pulse parameters (wavelength, duration, temporal separation etc.) to provide sufficient pre-ionization and to allow subsequent energy addition. Owing to the lack of visible emission, the study of such plasmas is challenging and a key feature of our proposal is the use of a newly developed microwave scattering technique to measure electron parameters. The proposed research will be transformative in terms of laser plasma formation; despite a large body of research in laser breakdown using single laser pulses there has been minimal research on multi-pulse approaches and pre-ionization. The three-year program will be conducted by Colorado State University (CSU), University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK), and Princeton University (PU) and combines experimental studies, advanced diagnostics, and computational plasma and combustion modeling."

More specifically, proving that a plasma at rest is stable under small perturbations would be a major physical discovery and would most certainly greatly enhance our ways to control plasma. This is especially fitting since plasma stability is one of the main factor limiting performances in tokamaks. Finally, beyond industrial applications, plasma represents the state of more than 99% of the matter in the universe and any work providing better understanding of this state would be of great importance. Dispersive equations and equations on curved spaces (manifolds) provide a rich area of interaction between various branches of mathematics as well as between different sciences. The study of equations on curved spaces is of interest to geometers, analysts, and number theorists in mathematics, as well as to theoretical physicists working in quantum chaos and general relativity. Fourth-order equations naturally arise in many different branches of physics and mathematics, especially those linked with elasticity and are critical to understand phenomena as diverse as the movement (and possible oscillations and breakdown) of bridges or the structure of blood vessels and the interaction between their membranes and the biofluids."

However, passing from the understanding of microscopic objects to moderately complex configurations remains a challenging problem. This projects aims at understanding simple but basic questions for slightly complicated systems, focusing on situations and models related to macroscopic plasma physics. A plasma is a collection of many charged particles that, because of their long range interactions exhibit a collective macroscopic behavior which is complex and remains poorly understood. This in turns limits some potential major applications, controlled fusion being perhaps the most well-known. Thus, furthering the understanding of this ""small scale to large scale"" cascade of information can have major possible applications. The emphasis of this proposal is on large-time questions such as ""can a plasma macroscopically at rest spontaneously develop dramatic behavior such as high concentration or velocities, or spontaneously form a vacuum?"". Another related question is to find possible scenarios for the large-time behavior of a plasma that remains away from the quiet neutral equilibrium. Investigating these questions involve a fine study of the deep mechanisms of transfer of energy inside different parts of the plasma as a result of collective elementary simple interactions.<br/><br/>This projects aims at developing the study of two fundamental equations from physics. First we consider stability issues for the 2-fluid Euler-Maxwell equation in two dimensions. This is a fundamental equation modeling the dynamical properties of a plasma. The goal is to prove that under certain conditions, small perturbations of an equilibrium will not develop shocks and that actually, the plasma will get back to equilibrium, even in the absence of dissipation. Such a result would be of great physical and mathematical importance as it is known to be false for the compressible Euler equation in the absence of a self-consistent electromagnetic field. In a second part, we study the Schroedinger equation on a curved background. This equation is a universal model appearing in many time reversible equations, notably in some plasma models. When this equation is posed on a nonconstant background, many classical tools from the Euclidian theory break down and one expects the appearance of various new phenomena due to the influence of the geometry. We study in particular the effect of the growth of the volume on the global behavior of the solutions and on the possibility to obtain asymptotic dynamics different from scattering. A unifying theme is to understand the asymptotic dynamics of solutions in a context where the dispersion is limited. Another unifying theme is to try to find simpler limit equations and understand their significance for the full model. A last unifying theme concerns the specificity and relevance of dispersive systems. Some tools we plan to use and develop are concentration compactness methods, study of the space and time resonances, study of dispersive systems and pseudo-products estimates with singular multipliers."

The charged atoms (ions) and electrons exert electrical forces on each other. In ordinary plasmas, the ions and electrons move quickly and only push on each other briefly as they rapidly pass one another. When the plasma temperature falls, the amount of time charged particles spend near each other increases and the influence of the electrical force becomes more pronounced. At low enough temperatures, the gaseous plasma assumes characteristics of dense liquids. Interestingly, fusion-class plasmas (extremely hot plasmas that are being studied for their potential as an advanced source of electrical power production) also behave as dense liquids. This happens not because of low temperature, but because of high density. The degree to which a plasma behaves as a dense liquid is given by a mathematical quotient of the plasma density divided by the temperature. In fusion plasmas, this quotient is large because of high density. In the proposed experiments, this quotient is large because of low temperature. This makes it possible for the proposed experiments to study the physics of fusion-class plasmas using a model system at low temperatures with exquisite control over experimental conditions. Activities funded by this proposal will explore the limits of low temperatures in ultracold plasmas. Brigham Young University, where this research will be carried out, sponsors one of the largest undergraduate physics programs in the nation. Because several undergraduate students will be involved in this work, NSF funding will directly influence their scientific education and preparation.<br/><br/>The strong coupling parameter, gamma, is limited in ultracold neutral plasmas by the process of disorder-induced heating (DIH). The cold ions are created by photo-ionizing laser-cooled Ca atoms in a magneto-optical trap. Although cold, these ions have an overwhelmingly large electrical potential energy. The ions are accelerated as they move to minimize their potential energy. The Ca ion temperature increases from a few mK to a few kelvin, a factor of 1000 in less than 100 ns. Kinetic and thermodynamic plasma properties scale with gamma. Unfortunately, DIH limits gamma to be less than 2 in neutral plasmas. The goal of this research, therefore, is to reduce the ion temperature in ultracold neutral plasmas using laser cooling, increasing the value of gamma. This proposal builds on extensive previous work by Dr. Bergeson in this field. Successful realization of this goal will generate a platform from which high-gamma experiments can be performed in the future. The ions will be cooled using a powerful frequency-broadened laser at 397 nm. The optical leak in the cooling transition to the 3d doublet D (J=3/2) level will be plugged using lasers at 850 and 854 nm. Repumping coherences will be avoided by alternately switching these near-infrared laser intensities. After a specified cooling time, the cooling light will be switched off and the ion temperature will be probed by scanning a low-intensity laser across the 397 nm absorption line profile, collecting the laser-induced fluorescence, and fitting the measured lineshape to a Voigt profile. One challenge in this project is using optical forces to overcome the electron-driven radial plasma expansion. Simulations suggest that this is possible. Another challenge will be to scatter photons from the plasma ions fast enough that the ions can be slowed and confined before velocity-changing collisions redistribute the ion kinetic energy to untrapped portions of the ensemble. Numerical estimates suggest that this should be possible at low plasma densities."

In these plasmas, where collisions between charged particles are rare, energy can be transferred to a charged particle from a plasma wave (analogous to a surfer on an ocean wave). As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another, and for energizing a small portion of the population to very high energies. There are many types of plasma waves. Microphysics tells us that plasma waves, called electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (EMIC), are able to scatter electrons formerly trapped in the radiation belts into the atmosphere where they are lost. However, the relative importance of EMIC waves to the global variability of the radiation belts has been a subject of intense scientific debate for the past 50 years. The main goal of the research is to resolve this debate by combining multi-point conjugate measurements of particles and fields in space with electron precipitation. The capability for making these measurements was recently expanded by the Van Allen Probes and BARREL balloons missions. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The resulting global maps of relativistic electron precipitation will be useful to the broader space physics and aeronomy communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>To address the open questions raised above, the methodology is to construct large-scale maps of plasma and wave fields in space and correlated maps of high-energy electrons precipitating into the atmosphere from multiple satellites both at high- and low-Earth orbit. At issue is how long radiation belt electrons actually travel through regions occupied by EMIC waves as they move along closed drift path in the radiation belts. The longer they interact with the EMIC waves the more likely they will be scattered out of their closed drift paths and be lost. If the waves exist only in limited regions that are sparsely distributed throughout the radiation belts, or turn on and off rapidly, their cumulative effects may be insignificant. Comparing these maps not only provides information about the global distribution of plasma waves but also about whether the relationships between the mapped quantities are consistent with EMIC waves. Even if these maps are not consistent with EMIC wave interactions with the energetic particles and cold plasmas, they provide clues to, and place constraints on, other mechanisms.."

The dangerous levels of energy and momentum, contained in this medium, constantly bombard the Earth. Though the Earth's magnetic field acts as a shield deflecting most of this medium around the Earth, some small fraction makes its way through the Earth's magnetic shield (called the magnetopause) and, even this small amount can power space storms at high altitudes in the space surrounding the Earth. How this happens is an important problem because severe space storms can negatively impact a variety of technologies upon which our interconnected society relies. Most recently, the potential of extreme space weather events to disrupt power grids over global scales with cascading disruption of a large variety of critical social infrastructures has been the subject of national and international attention. It is commonly accepted that primary mechanism to deliver solar wind energy into the magnetosphere is the joining of the Earth's magnetic field lines with the Sun's through the process of magnetic merging. However, another route has recently come to light though the exact details and relative importance are not yet known. Large amplitude low frequency plasma waves are commonly observed just inside the magnetopause in the vicinity of mixed populations of heated and cold ions and Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are waves generated on the magnetopause surface by the solar wind blowing past. Current theories suggest that these surface waves couple to internal waves along magnetic field lines (called kinetic Alfven waves) at the plasma and field gradients associated with the magnetopause. These waves are able to heat ions within the magnetosphere. This process, in effect, transmits energy from the solar wind into the ion populations within the magnetosphere. However, there has been no experimental confirmation yet that the observed low frequency waves in this region are indeed kinetic Alfven waves. This proposal introduces a novel data analysis technique that is able to identify the modes of the observed plasma waves. If successful this represents a major step forward. The science topic addressed here has parallels with the problem of solar coronal heating; therefore advances will also be of interest to the solar and astrophysics communities. A graduate student will receive training and mentoring while working on this project and undergraduate REU students will participate in the project over the summer months. Finally the PI is herself an early career female physics professor who will be able to continue her research program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University as a result of this project.<br/><br/>This project uses a newly demonstrated novel technique to experimentally determine the dispersion relation and thus identify the wave modes of large-amplitude plasma waves frequently present in the low latitude boundary layer. This technique requires two Cluster spacecraft with the appropriate separation to observe a plasma wave in a region of mixed plasma populations or K-H waves in the vicinity of the magnetopause. Observations of electric and magnetic fields by the two spacecraft are used in the construction of the dispersion relation, which allows identification of the particular plasma wave mode. The technique has been successfully for one case. Identifying a significant number of such events where the above conditions are met introduces considerable risk into the success of the project but if successful, the rewards are high."

The three major tasks of this project are to investigate: (1) the role of plasmoid instabilities in producing turbulent reconnection in line-tied coronal current sheets, and the role such turbulence plays in the observed broadening of current sheets; (2) the role of secondary Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities in reconnection exhaust regions in producing the observed characteristics of SADs; and, (3) the formation of plasmoids and SADs during a CME. One important aspect of this project is to foster cross-comparison, verification, and validation between simulations and solar observations. One of the major goals is to establish the capability of capturing coronal eruption, plasmoid formation, and SADs within a single simulation. The results of this project are expected to further advance our understanding in how the magnetic energy is stored and released in large-scale systems such as the solar corona."

It influences the formation of the 'hot spot' in inertial confinement fusion, limits radial compression of imploding Z-pinches, drives penetration of stellar ejecta into pulsar wind nebula, dominates energy transport in core-collapse supernova, provides conditions for synthesis of heavy mass elements in thermonuclear stellar flashes, controls material transformation under high strain rates, and strongly affects the dynamics of shocks and blast waves. Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops when matters (plasmas) of different densities are accelerated against the density gradients. The induced material mixing is a complex (anisotropic, inhomogeneous and statistically unsteady) turbulent process, whose theoretical description requires novel approaches that go well beyond the domain of idealized canonical considerations. The tremendous successes achieved recently in high energy density plasma experiments and in large-scale numerical simulations, and the striking similarity of behavior of Rayleigh-Taylor mixing in vastly different physical regimes make this moment right for a theory to appear and to advance knowledge of fundamental aspects of the non-equilibrium turbulent processes in plasmas.<br/><br/>The core of this theoretical approach is a new concept, the invariance of the rate of momentum loss. This concept will be applied to capture the transports of mass, momentum and energy in Rayleigh-Taylor mixing plasmas and to study invariants, scale coupling, scaling, and statistics of the turbulent process. Group theory and stochastic analysis considerations will be employed, and coherence and randomness of the dynamics will be analyzed and related to space-time symmetries of the conservation laws. Incorporating the high energy density conditions, the dependencies of integral characteristics of plasma mixing will be investigated and their connection will be established to the control parameters of simulations and experiments (e.g. target non-uniformities in high-power laser experiments). The developed theoretical foundations will be further applied to analyze existing datasets and to advance the design of experiments and simulations. The project will impact a broad range of disciplines in science, mathematics and engineering, including plasmas, high energy density physics, astrophysics, mathematical physics, stochastic processes, fluid dynamics, and material science, as well as technology in the areas of nuclear energy and communications. It will also initiate a new program for graduate education on modern methods of theoretical modeling and advanced data analysis techniques. The theoretical tools will be communicated through and contribute to the development of a newly emerging international research community 'Turbulent mixing and beyond.'"

This award supports fundamental research on high-density plasma using a unique magnetically enhanced inductive plasma source. New knowledge obtained from the research will lead to novel plasma sources that enable efficient manufacturing of electronic devices and various thin-film products, significantly reducing the costs of consumer electronics, promoting the adoption of clean energy, and reducing the negative impact of manufacturing on the environment. This project will strengthen university-industry collaboration and economic competitiveness of the U.S. electronics industry. It will also contribute to workforce development by training students and attracting local tribal students to science and engineering. <br/><br/>Industry plasmas are created by strong electromagnetic fields. The efficiency of plasma processing is mainly determined by plasma density, plasma temperature, and energy distribution of electrons and ions. Conventional low-density plasmas are excited by unconfined electromagnetic fields that allow energetic electrons to escape easily from the plasma region, while high-density plasmas can be created by confined electromagnetic fields that retain energetic electrons within the plasma region to greatly extend their lifetime. The confined electric and magnetic fields act simultaneously and have interaction effects on the plasma. Little is known about the properties of high-density plasma created by confined electromagnetic fields and the effects of the primary induction parameters (excitation frequency and magnetic field distribution) on plasma properties. To fill this knowledge gap, the research team will perform three tasks. First, establish a plasma simulation model using dedicated software COMSOL to describe fundamental plasma properties (including plasma density, plasma temperature, and energy distribution of electrons and ions). Second, use the established model to predict effects of excitation frequency and magnetic field distribution on plasma properties. Finally, verify some of the predicted results by experiments. For example, plasma density and electron energy distribution at a limited number of points of the plasma region will be measured using a Langmuir probe, and plasma density over the entire plasma region will be indirectly measured using an optical emission spectrometer."

Ionized gas, or in scientific terms plasma, is the most common state of matter in the Universe. In the solar system, for example, the solar corona where solar eruptions occur, the solar wind that carries the erupted plasma and magnetic field from the Sun to the Earth, the magnetosphere surrounding the Earth and protecting us from the harmful effects of the eruption, and the ionosphere through which radio communications and GPS signals propagate and get disturbed, all consist of plasma. Understanding plasma is crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of space weather. Plasmas also play an important role in engineering, for example in the design of fusion type reactors that promise to provide an inexhaustible source of clean energy for humanity. Computational modeling of plasma dynamics is very challenging due to the different spatial and temporal scales and the complex behavior of the system. The project is aimed at improving the efficiency of present plasma simulation models by a factor of 1000 or even more. If successful, the new model will provide accurate and affordable simulations for systems that currently cannot be modeled even on the largest supercomputers.<br/><br/>There are different approaches for plasma modeling that all have advantages and drawbacks. The most accurate kinetic methods describe all the important effects of plasma by describing the full distribution function in a six dimensional phase space, but they have tremendous computational cost. Even on today's supercomputers, modeling a large three-dimensional system with kinetic methods is far out of reach. Alternative fluid-type methods describe the plasma distribution function with a handful of moments, such as density, velocity and pressure. Solving for these quantities in addition to the magnetic field can be done quite efficiently, and in fact one can model the solar corona, the solar wind, and the magnetosphere with global fluid models with reasonable computational resources. Unfortunately, in most systems there are some parts of the domain where the fluid description is not sufficient, and this can have consequences for the global solution. The project aims at combining the kinetic and fluid type methods in an adaptive and dynamic fashion. The expensive kinetic model will be restricted to the small parts of the domain where the fluid description is not accurate enough, while the efficient fluid methods will be employed in the vast majority of the domain. This hybrid approach promises to provide accurate solutions at a tiny fraction of the cost of the fully kinetic models. A speed up of factor of 1000 or even more is expected. This will allow modeling global plasma systems with unprecedented accuracy and vastly improve our understanding and predictive capabilities."

Plasma electrolysis is a glow discharge (like Neon light) in contact with liquid. The plasma is confined around an electrode by the liquid electrolyte, leading to very high energy density. This high-density plasma facilitates effective formation of nanoparticles from the working electrode. This research will benefit the scientific community by advancing knowledge about plasma physics and chemistry at liquid-gas-solid interfaces.

Strongly coupled plasmas arise in several disciplines influencing energy, security and fundamental physics research. Examples include dense plasmas found in inertial confinement fusion experiments, intense laser-material interaction studies, sonoluminescing microbubbles, as well as astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs and giant planet interiors. Ultracold plasmas provide a unique window to view this physics because they can be accurately measured using lasers. This enables detailed tests of theoretical models.

In addition to gravity that affects all matter, electric and magnetic forces are important in determining the behavior of the ionospheric plasma. The plasma behaves as a fluid even if there are few collisions between particles because electric and magnetic forces act at a distance. Analogous to waves in the ocean, plasma waves transmit energy through the ionosphere. Electromagnetic, pressure and velocity fields in combination produce a wide variety of plasma waves. This wave environment is extremely complex with a range of generation mechanisms, wave frequencies, and source locations. However, because of this complexity, many of these waves and their generation mechanisms are poorly understood. The auroral region contributes significantly to the natural radio wave environment of the Earth. This project investigates auroral roar and its generation mechanisms, which are complex and nonlinear involving wave-wave and wave-particle interactions. Because the types of waves generated depend on plasma conditions and can be observed far from the source region, they provide a means to infer the characteristics of plasmas remotely. As a result, what is learned about waves in the auroral region can be used to interpret conditions in astrophysical and planetary environments where these same waves are generated. <br/><br/>To study the origins of auroral roar, this project uses, and develops further, weak turbulence theory. This, in itself, is an important outcome of the project. A main aim is to contribute to the development of a unifying theory of plasmas and radio emission observed in the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere. Non-linear studies of auroral roar are likely to lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics of wave-particle interactions. Four problems are explored in some detail: (1) the formation of the fine frequency structure of auroral roar emissions; (2) the decay of intense upper hybrid waves into multiple harmonics and lower frequency waves; (3) nonlinear coalescence generation of 4fce auroral roar; and (4) decay instability of upper-hybrid, lower-hybrid, and Bernstein waves."

The proposed instrument is capable of producing high quality,highly conformal thin films (such as diamond or silica) on nano to macroscale structures with controlled thickness and material properties at less than 200 degree centigrade temperature. Such capabilities for low-temperature thin-film deposition can enable coating of conventional substrates, such assemiconductors, metals and ceramics, as well as flexible substrates, including plastics and polymers. The instrument will also deposit thin films on biocompatible materials for application in drug delivery, sensing, imaging and printed electronics. Technologies developed as a result of this new equipment, both directly and indirectly, could have revolutionary impact on our quality of life in a wide spectrum of application areas, including ultra-reliable systems for communication, transportation and information technology, security response based on radiation detection, sustainable energy harvesting, sensing and bioengineering systems. Large numbers of students at UC Davis, Northern California high schools and community colleges, including many students from minority and underrepresented communities, as well as postdoctoral researchers, will have the opportunity to be educated in the immersive transdisciplinaryenvironment surrounding this tool, uniquely preparing them to solve important problems and succeed in today's highly competitive academic or industrial environments. <br/><br/>A plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition instrument with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-PECVD) is capable of producing high quality, highly conformal thin films of silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxy-nitride, silicon carbide, amorphous silicon, and diamond-like carbon. The tool will enable researchers at the University of California, Davis, to use tightly controlled composition and thickness in the thin film, with controlled doping and tunable index in 20-200 degree centigrade temperature ranges, deposited on a variety of surfaces and over a range of structures. The tool allows investigation of nano and microstructures that otherwise could not be fabricated. The principal objectives of research using the ICP-PECVD tool will include: (1) fabrication of nano and microscale structures on lattice matched and mismatched substrates and integrated devices for photonics, energy conversion, biosensing, and MEMS/NEMS; (2) defect-free conformal passivation and encapsulation of devices and systems for improved efficiency and reliability; (3) transmission and reflection coatings for optoelectronic and energy conversion devices; (4) low-temperature coatings for biocompatible and other temperature sensitive materials for applications in drug delivery, sensing, imaging and printed electronics; and (5) new semiconductor materials such as III-nitride for ultra-reliable systems. The unique characteristics of PECVD integrated with ICP will allow operations at low temperatures, significantly strengthen a number of ongoing interdisciplinary research programs, and enable an even greater number of research activities over itsuseful lifetime. The tool will be operated in a professionally run environment to facilitate work in two complementary research dimensions: (i) inquiry-based dimension defining the foundational engineering science for future technologies, including the elements of new materials platforms, component and device innovation, circuit and systems design, and novel process and manufacturing science; and (ii) integrative technology-based application dimension that becomes part of a test bed at UC Davis for making working prototypes and systems to test novel ideas generated by students and faculty members."

Carbon dioxide gas generated by power generation or industrial processes is a potential source of carbon for fuels and chemicals production. However, carbon dioxide is not very reactive, and no viable technologies for its conversion into fuels and chemicals presently exist. The goal of this product is to convert carbon dioxide and water to fuels and chemical using plasma-enhanced solar energy. In the proposed process, solar energy heats the carbon dioxide gas to the high temperatures needed to increase its reactivity. The heated gas is then converted into plasma, also known as an electrically charged gas, using electrical energy. It is reasoned that the plasma state of the gas will enhance the rate of carbon dioxide conversion. The process is potentially sustainable and has a low carbon footprint because it uses waste carbon dioxide and abundant solar energy, where electricity needed to generate the plasma is provided by solar photovoltaic cells. The project will also develop instructional carts for demonstrating energy and sustainability topics inspired by this research to a broad audience that includes Hispanic K-12 students in the Lowell, Massachusetts area. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of a new process for synthesis of chemical and fuels from carbon dioxide and water using concentrated solar energy to drive the reaction thermochemistry and non-equilibrium plasma to enhance the chemical reaction kinetics. Plasma-Enhanced Solar Energy (PESE) combines solar thermochemistry and plasma science principles. The project will experimentally and computationally investigate PESE for carbon dioxide, water, and methane decomposition and reforming. The research will test the hypothesis that the molecular excitation produced by free electrons in plasmas increases solar photon absorption leading to enhanced chemical reaction kinetics. Towards this end, the proposed research will seek to understand non-equilibrium energy transport phenomena characteristic of free electron and photon systems, with particular focus on processes with comparable photon and electron energy fluxes. To support the research plan, new reactor systems equipped with solar energy receivers and non-equilibrium electrical discharge capability to flowing gas will be developed and characterized. Reactor experiments spanning the ratio of solar to electrical energy inputs will be performed at scalable process conditions. New fluid flow and chemical kinetics models for non-equilibrium energy transport will be derived and experimentally validated. The research outcomes seek to reveal the specific pathways of energy conversion during PESE processing and quantify the efficacy of plasma enhancement. Additionally, the research outcomes are relevant to other fields where electron and photon transport have essential roles, such as laser materials processing, semiconductor manufacturing, and combustion enhancement. The educational goal of the project is to engage students, from middle school to graduate level, on global energy sustainability topics. To enable the proposed education program, interactive demonstration carts for the modular teaching and learning of energy engineering & sustainability will be developed and assessed."

However, the efficiency of the process has been low due to low energy of individual discharges and accumulation of debris particles in the inter-electrode gaps, especially, when machining micro-scale features. Further, the electro discharge machines use pressure flushing techniques that result in consumption of significantly higher amount of dielectric than needed for an effective discharge process. This award supports research to study an atomized dielectric-based electro discharge machining process that can reduce the consumption of the dielectric 10-20 folds and helping to achieve an environmentally sustainable machining process. The new process will offer unique capabilities of manufacturing high-accuracy components and devices with complex geometries. In addition, the quantitative understanding of plasma discharges in flowing liquid will be useful in a number of plasma applications ranging from water purification to plasma medicine.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to improve the efficiency of the micro-electro discharge machining process and produce an environmentally-sustainable machining process by reducing the consumption of hazardous dielectric. The approach is to atomize dielectric and produce a thin moving film that fills inter-electrode gap and flushes out the debris efficiently. This research has four specific objectives: (1) to understand film formation, flow characteristics, melt-pool formation, and debris flushing; (2) to understand the formation, collapse, and discharge of plasma in liquid medium; (3) to establish the relationship between the trajectory of the debris and the dielectric velocity; and (4) to establish relationships between process parameters and machining characteristics (discharge energy, material removal, and debris flushing). To achieve these objectives, a film formation model will be developed using mass and momentum transfer from the dielectric droplets in the spray; a spatially-resolved three-dimensional plasma model will be developed using a fluid-based approach; and the debris flushing model will be developed using the force balance at the flowing debris particle in the inter-electrode gap. To validate these models, experimentally measured data will be compared to model predictions. Film thickness will be measured using high-speed camera, plasma temperature and electron density will be measured using spectroscopy, and debris particle distribution around the discharge location will be determined from the measurements of different sized debris particles using scanning electron microscope."

Most of the light reaching Earth originates at the 'surface' of the sun, a region called the photosphere. However, the regions of the solar atmosphere immediately above this surface, the solar chromosphere and corona, create most of the dangerous Ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation. These regions also generate the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that pass the Earth at speeds in excess of 400km/s. Both the rapidly changing radiation and the solar wind create hazards for spacecraft, astronauts, and have a number of important terrestrial impacts. A long-standing mystery has prevented scientists from understanding and accurately modeling the chromosphere and corona. A short distance above the 'surface' of the sun, the solar atmosphere's temperature jumps up by a factor of two to three. The goal of this project is to provide an explanation of the origin of this heating. The project will also provide opportunities to recruit and train student researchers in plasma and solar physics, simulations, and modeling at the Boston University. Many of the Boston University PI's undergraduate research advisees, about half of whom are women, have continued on to graduate school. <br/><br/>This research will examine whether solar plasma flows emerging from the photosphere can transfer sufficient energy into turbulent plasma of the solar atmosphere, which, in turn, will heat the chromosphere sufficiently to explain whether the observed UV spectra originate there. It will also evaluate whether this mechanism can account for chromospheric spectral observations. This requires four linked research tasks: (1) solving for plasma drifts and fields when a convecting neutral gas pushes it across magnetic field lines; (2) analyzing the theory of streaming instabilities applicable to the collisional plasma found there; (3) performing a series of kinetic simulations to explore the nonlinear and thermal properties of the resulting turbulence; and (4) incorporating the resulting electron heating into a radiative transport code in order to evaluate its impact on chromospheric radiance. This research combines several research areas encompassed by the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Science and Engineering."

The strong nuclear force is responsible for a long list of phenomena that are crucial to the existence of the universe. For example, the strong force holds together atomic nuclei, it fuels the burning of the sun and all other stars, and it governed the fate of the very early universe. Although the fundamental equations describing the strong force (or quantum chromodynamics, QCD) were written down four decades ago, an in-depth understanding of its properties is still lacking. This project will help advance the understanding of key features of the strong force at very high temperatures and densities. At temperatures of about 1,000,000,000,000 degrees all matter subject to the strong nuclear force forms a state of matter called quark gluon plasma. Quark gluon plasma was prevalent in the early universe milliseconds after the Big Bang. The quark gluon plasma can be recreated in the laboratory in collisions of very large nuclei in the highest energy collider facilities in the world, such as the Large Hadron Collider in Europe and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the US. The PI, working with his graduate students, will carry out research to improve the understanding of the formation and development of quark gluon plasma in nuclear collisions. <br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive computational simulation of nuclear collisions. The initial phase of those collisions at high energy is dominated by strong, nonlinear gluon fields. Because nuclei collide in random configurations and with random impact parameters an event-by-event Monte Carlo simulation of gluon fields will be provided. The system eventually reaches approximate local kinetic equilibrium and the further time evolution can be followed up by relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. Comparison to data from LHC and RHIC can determine the equation of state and important transport coefficients of quark gluon plasma. The project will also shed light on the coupling of quark gluon plasma to electromagnetic probes (photons). In addition, the PI and his students will study the effect of the initial strong gluon fields on very fast quarks and gluons (jets), and on heavy quarks. Both of those are important probes for properties of quark gluon plasma. The project will also provide tools for the next generation collider experiments planned at an electron ion collider. The latter will allow for a systematic study of strong gluon fields and the creation of quark and gluon jets in a nuclear environment."

Non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas are powerful sources for reactive chemical species that can have profound biological effects, but the sources are complex, poorly understood, and are difficult to design and control. Our knowledge of the nature of the plasma-biomaterial interaction using such atmospheric pressure plasma sources is especially inadequate. This work combines plasma source characterization/simulations, plasma-surface (tissue) treatments/in-situ surface characterization with biological assay methodologies, and various characterization approaches, including magnetic resonance characterization of solid state and solution macromolecules. The broader impacts of this project go beyond the establishment of baseline methodologies that can be used to characterize and control interactions of APP sources with biological targets. As an enabling technology, approaches and concepts unveiled in this work can be broadly applied in diverse applications where the biological environment must be well-controlled, e.g. disinfection of packaging for food and medicines, modification of biological systems, cells and tissue, including the field of plasma medicine. The principles under study in this project are also relevant to all applications of APP for surface functionalization of organic materials such as polymers.<br/><br/>The project's first objective is to obtain a fundamental understanding of how fluxes of reactive species produced in two representative APP devices depend on source type, operating parameters and environmental conditions using relevant chemistries. The second objective is to expose selected biomolecules to well controlled species from these APP sources to induce atomistic modifications of the biomolecules. The changes in biomolecule properties (chemical, morphological etc) along with alterations in biological function will be characterized using an array of complementary methods. Furthermore, modifications in biological function will be correlated with the results of the comprehensive materials/surface characterizations to provide underlying chemical and biological mechanisms. The third objective is to obtain a scientific understanding of how water modulates APP-biomolecule interactions to affect its biological function. This includes establishment of differences in APP species fluxes, chemical/morphological changes in biomolecules, and their biological responses to bio-assays when water is present either in the gas stream passing through the APP source, the environment (humidity) or as a liquid on the surface of the biomolecule. The fourth objective is experimental validation of current computational efforts on simulating atomic-scale modifications of specific model biomolecules by reactive species produced by APP sources. This will be based on investigating biomolecules for which atomic-scale simulations of the interaction of reactive plasma species with these biomolecules have either been published, or are currently ongoing."

Because plasma, often referred to as the fourth state of matter, is the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe, there exist many important application problems for which an understanding would be advantageous. The motivating application for this research is high-energy particle acceleration using laser-plasma interactions. The production of high-energy particle beams is important in the process of creating synchrotron radiation, which is used for small scale imaging in many application areas including materials science, biology, and medicine. Laser-plasma acceleration is a mechanism for generating high-energy electrons by hitting a plasma with a specifically-tuned ultra-short laser beam. This approach provides the possibility to create high-energy particles with a device much smaller than standard particle accelerators. The big challenge with this approach is to be able to generate a relativistic electron beam with a small energy spread. The objective of this research is to develop highly accurate and efficient computational methods for simulating the acceleration of high-energy electrons. This research aims to develop novel computational techniques for so-called 'kinetic models' of plasma that achieve accuracy and robustness by exactly conserving certain important properties (e.g., mass and energy conservation and positivity of the solution). These methods will be implemented in computer code that will take advantage of modern computer architectures. The resulting methods will be used to simulate various scenarios of laser-plasma interactions with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms of electron acceleration and the features of the produced electron bream.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this research is to develop accurate and efficient computational methods for solving nonlinear partial differential equations used to model plasma dynamics. The mathematical models considered in this work arise from an important application problem: laser plasma accelerators, which provide a promising mechanism for generating high-energy electrons by hitting a plasma with a specifically-tuned ultra-short laser beam. The research will focus on developing efficient high-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes for kinetic Vlasov systems. The two main challenges that will be addressed are the development of (1) efficient time-stepping procedures that allow for time-steps that are dictated by physically important time scales and (2) high-order discretizations that numerically conserve important physical properties such as mass, momentum, and energy, as well as properties such as the positivity of the solution. One approach that will be explored in this research in order to improve the efficiency of the kinetic Vlasov numerical methods is the coupling of kinetic Vlasov solvers to fluid solvers to obtain a multiscale fluid/kinetic method. Part of the work will be done in collaboration with an experimental physicists, Prof. Dr. Malte Kaluza (Jena), who will help guide the mathematical modeling in order to keep the models relevant to the important physics of laser-plasma accelerators. Correspondingly, the resulting computational results will be used to influence laser-plasma experiments. The software that will result from this research project, along with proper<br/>documentation, will be made freely available on the web as part of the open-source package DoGPack."

Strongly coupled plasmas are ionized gases in which the interparticle potential energy is greater than the particle kinetic energy. They behave like a crystal or liquid, unlike the more familiar weakly coupled plasmas, which behave like a gas. A dusty plasma is a four-component mixture of micron-size particles of solid matter, electrons, ions, and neutral gas. The solid particles become charged due to collecting electrons and ions. The electric field in a plasma sheath can levitate these charged particles against gravity, allowing the confinement of 1D, 2D or 3D clouds of particles. A particle's charge is large, typically Q = -10,000 electronic charges, so that pairs of particles have a large interparticle repulsion. The large potential energy of this repulsion, together with a cooling of particles by gas drag, lead to strong coupling among the particles. By tailoring the manipulation and confinement of the particles, experiments are performed to study a variety of physical phenomena in statistical mechanics, transport and nonlinear waves. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this project includes: cross-cutting research topics of interest to a wide range of physics disciplines, outreach, training of graduate and undergraduate students, and broad dissemination of results."

This project will investigate how and why cells adapt their plasma membrane composition in response to several changes in their growth conditions. Many of these sensing functions are thought to depend on how proteins and lipids are organized within the plasma membrane, and the researchers will investigate how both membrane heterogeneity and sensing functions are impacted as cells adjust membrane composition. The long term goals of the project are to discover how cells maintain a heterogeneous membrane, and how this membrane structure contributes to the efficient functioning of the cell.

Plasma assisted materials processing is largely responsible for the impressive progress that continues to be made in production of microelectronics devices of ever increasing capability. Plasma etching is the only known, industrially implementable method to fabricate the nanometer sized features in logic and memory chips. During plasma etching, fluxes of ions and neutral particles are directed towards the wafer being processed. The energy and angle of impact of the particles onto the surface of wafers are the critical parameters for the fabrication of microelectronic devices, as well as nanostructured and biocompatible materials. Control of these parameters allows for finer control of the surface composition and, in microelectronics fabrication, etch rate. Low temperature plasmas for plasma materials processing have traditionally used continuously excited plasmas. However, all major semiconductor chip and equipment manufacturers are predicting that pulsed plasmas will be the enabling technology for achieving sub-10 nanometer feature sizes. The most direct impact of this research is addressing fundamental science issues that are of paramount importance to the plasma processing of high performance microelectronics, nanostructures and biocompatible materials. In addition to the technological broader impacts, this project will be highly focused on educational outreach. Prof. Gekelman is one of the founders of LAPTAG (Los Angeles Physics Teachers Alliance Group) and several LAPTAG students and will be involved in these plasma processing studies. Prof. Kushner, director of the Michigan Institute of Plasma Science and Engineering, will leverage those resources to launch the Plasma Picture of the Day website with the goal of providing informative images of plasmas to educate the general public and school children about plasmas.<br/><br/>The lack of fundamental understanding of the dynamics of pulsed plasma systems is the current impediment to widespread adoption. For example, instabilities and waves are nearly universally observed in pulsed plasmas, and particularly in electronegative plasmas, which sometimes prevents operation in desirable parameters spaces. The sources of these instabilities and the means to prevent them are not understood. Pulsed plasma processing can be arbitrarily complex. For example, modern capacitively coupled plasma etching tools may be driven by up to 3 separate power supplies at different frequencies which can be pulsed independently at different repetition rates and different duty cycles. The combinations of parameters can number into the millions. This extremely large parameter space places a large premium on having a fundamental understanding of pulsed plasma processing and so be able to predict plasma performance. In this research project, a highly collaborative experimental-modeling effort will investigate the fundamental properties of pulsed plasmas as used in materials processing, with an emphasis on instabilities and waves, diagnosing and modeling the dynamics of the transition from interpulse afterglow to powered plasma, and the means to improve uniformity through pulsing. Laser induced fluorescence will be used to characterize the trajectory of ions as they are accelerated through the transient sheaths produced by pulsed plasmas; and will be correlated with Langmuir probe measurements of plasma properties. Multi-dimensional computer modeling will be validated by these measurements and will be further used to illuminate fundamental issues related to plasma transport in pulsed systems."

The internal surface area of such materials is substantial, making the material excellent for chemical processing applications. Porous media play an important role in modern society with applications ranging from water filtration, such as activated charcoal filters, to air filtration. Indeed, a catalytic converter exploits porous media's high surface area to volume ratio to achieve high emission reduction efficiency in automobile exhausts. New and emerging applications of porous media include fuel cells and clean combustion. Porous media combustion in particular takes place in the pores. The energy released there elevates the medium temperature so that injected fuel automatically ignites upon entry. This technology has the potential to reduce auto emissions and significantly increase fuel efficiency by enabling very lean fuel burns. The introduction of small amounts of ionized gas, a micro-plasma, inside the pores can further reduce ignition temperature thereby allowing for further increases in efficiency. Additionally, reactive micro-plasmas produced in the pores have the potential to decompose toxic combustion byproducts as well as to clean the pores to greatly improve service lifetime. Currently, the micro-plasma production in porous media is not well understood. This effort aims to improve the understanding and optimize the production of micro-plasmas in porous media by using a combination of experiments and simulations. The goal of the effort is to bridge the gap between scientific understanding of plasma production in porous media and actual applications. The understanding obtained from this effort contributes to the development and realization of clean burning, highly efficient, low emission automobiles, advanced fuel cells and advanced industrial smoke stack scrubbers. <br/><br/>A fundamental understanding of the physical conditions that lead to interconnected plasma propagation from pore to pore is necessary before one can credibly control and thus exploit micro-plasmas in porous media (MPPM). We expect that a combination of diffusive transport between pores and plasma avalanche within the pores, augmented by surface charging and radiation transport, play key roles in establishing plasma interconnectivity between adjacent pores. However there is now little experimental or theoretical confirmation of these or other theories. In this research project, we will investigate the basic properties of atmospheric pressure plasmas propagating into and through porous media in chemically reacting environments. The goals are to improve our understanding of plasma-surface interactions, which lead to MPPM, through a collaborative investigation combining comprehensive experimental measurements and first-principles, fluid, hybrid and kinetic modeling. Two configurations will be studied. The first is a structured porous material represented by a pack-bed reactor consisting of dielectric beads or rods having a controlled radius, permittivity, conductivity and layout placed between metal electrodes. The second configuration will be a truly randomly structured porous material, ceramic and/or metal foam, as is commercially available. The project also includes a K-12 outreach effort targeting low-income students. The effort aims to introduce the students to plasma science and the emerging field of plasma-aided combustion through both hands on experiments and science lesson modules."

They are of practical interest, because nanoparticles are a major source of contamination in semiconductor processing and because of the use of plasmas to synthesize nanoparticles for a wide variety of applications, ranging from photovoltaics to cancer treatment. In this project a cyber infrastructure will be developed that will underpin the development of numerical models of nanodusty plasmas. With this cyber infrastructure, heretofore unresolved phenomena in these highly complex systems will be investigated.<br/>The project involves a collaboration that will advance several different fields of science and engineering, bringing together expertise in computational modeling of chemically reacting plasmas and plasma transport, particle nucleation and growth, aerosol dynamics and computational chemistry. It draws on staff and resources of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and supercomputer facilities at Pacific Northwest and Argonne National Laboratories, and involves collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories on the development of computational techniques for parallelization of hybrid particle-fluid models. The cyber platform to be developed will build upon the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM), developed by one of the PIs, by implementing a hierarchy of physics and chemistry modules to address the complexity of particle nucleation and growth and aerosol dynamics. Leveraging the HPEM's existing industrial user base, the project has a strong component of technology transfer, including possible commercialization with an industrial partner.

The development of such models is a challenging undertaking, made more so by the paucity of needed fundamental data on properties and reactivities of small clusters, and by the fact that real plasma systems are typically three-dimensional. Tackling these problems is ambitious from the viewpoint of physics and chemistry, many aspects of which are poorly understood, and from the computational viewpoint, as vast ranges of length and time scales are involved, with strongly coupled interacting subsystems and nonlinear behavior. The development of a cyber infrastructure that enables accurate simulations of real nanodusty plasmas will mark a major paradigm shift.<br/><br/>Graduate students and postdocs involved in the project will work in an interdisciplinary environment that bridges the cultures of engineering and science. The project includes the development of a cyber infrastructure to be made available to researchers in academia and national labs, transfer of technology to industry through software licensing, and international collaborations. Through the development of interactive Web-based graphical user interfaces, real-time 3-D visualization, and massively parallel computing, the project will transform the study of nanodusty plasmas, with benefits to researchers in advancing fundamental understanding, to the semiconductor industry in developing strategies to avoid nanoparticle contamination, and to the creation of engineered nanoparticles for applications such as photovoltaics and cancer treatment.<br/><br/>This is a Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation Program award and is co-funded by the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the CISE directorate, the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the MPS directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

Conventional accelerator facilities must be large because the accelerating fields are limited by electrical breakdown of the material when the potential difference reaches some threshold. Energy gain is force times distance, so if the field strength (and therefore force) is limited then the distance must be increased to achieve higher and higher particle energies. This has lead to many mile scale facilities being constructed. However, if we use completely ionized gas -- plasma -- it turns out that an accelerating structure can be generated that is not limited in field strength. In other words; an accelerator can be miniaturized. The astonishing field strength in a plasma based accelerator can typically be equivalent to a 2 mile conventional accelerator being reduced to half a meter in length. Plasma accelerators can be created using high intensity lasers, which generate an evacuated ionic cavity, or 'bubble' with strong accelerating electric fields. It turns out that this plasma 'bubble' also has ideal characteristics for providing a miniature wiggler structure; an alternative to an external magnetic structure (such as the 1 mile length LCLS extension to SLAC) for generating radiation. The plasma can therefore be both an accelerator and wiggler combined. Alternatively, a second laser beam can also be used to wiggle the electrons. In both caes, a Doppler-like effect means that the radiation emitted by the relativistic electron beam is upshifted to much higher frequencies than those of the oscillating structure. The combination of lasers and plasmas can therefore provide very intense, energetic sources of x and gamma rays.<br/><br/>The drive for radiation sources is prompted by the numerous applications, from aiding the development of the anti-flu drug Relenza or a vaccine for foot and mouth disease to imaging residual stresses in aircraft wings or determining whether Beethoven was poisoned by analysis of a sample of his hair. This has motivated the development of large x-ray light sources around the world. The research proposed here is of a fundamental nature but also with an exciting applicability and potential technological impact. There are a vast number of unanswered questions on the laser propagation, plasma behavior, and radiation generation to be explored. However, one of the most exciting things associated with the research is the potential for miniature and inexpensive synchrotron light sources that could be available more widely; accessible to universities, small research facilities or hospitals. This could revolutionize a vast swath of scientific and engineering disciplines, as researchers from biotechnology to mechanical engineering are currently waiting for time on existing synchrotron light sources. Increased access to brilliant x-ray light sources could therefore increase the progress of technologic development in many fields."

Despite their ubiquity, many fundamental and important physical processes which control the dynamics of plasmas remain poorly understood. In turn, this limits our ability to intepret diverse phenomena in space such as accretion onto black holes at the centers of galaxies or the interaction of the solar wind with the upper layers of the Earth?s atmosphere, and it also impacts our ability to engineer and operate experiments on Earth such as magnetically confined fusion devices. The Max-Panck/Princeton Center for Plasma Physics (MPPC) was established as a joint venture of the Max Planck Society (MPS) in Germany and Princeton University in order to forge new collaborations between Universities, the national plasma labs, and international partners in order to tackle some of the most pressing problems in plasma dynamics. The center fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between the plasma and astrophysics communities, as well as international collaboration between these communities in the US, Germany, and elsewhere. It serves to train the next generation of plasma scientists in experimental science, computation, and theory, and its international scope provides unique training for early career scientists, particularly valuable as plasma and fusion science become increasingly international. Finally, the center provides opportunities for the public, as well as students and teachers at public schools, local, and regional institutions to engage in scientific inquiry in ways that enhance their understanding of science concepts and scientific ways of thinking through a well established outreach program at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.<br/><br/>The MPPC focuses its effort studying four key topics: magnetic reconnection, acceleration and propagation of non-thermal particles, the properties of plasma turbulence, and magnetohydrodynamic processes in astrophysical plasmas such as the magneto-rotational instability. Uniquely, it leverages international expertise and resources such as experimental facilities and computational methods to lead new studies in theoretical, experimental, and computational plasma physics. The US program concentrates strongly on postdoctoral researchers, who work with senior researchers supported by existing funds. While the postdoc program is the engine that drives research in the center, there are a number of ways in which each participating organization has fused together as a center, for example (1) joint mentoring of postdocs, (2) exchange visits of senior members, (3) joint experiments, (4) joint code development and validation, (5) fostering collaborations across the entire US and German plasma and astrophysics communities, and (6) annual meetings of the center as a whole, and more frequent topical workshops for the community. For example, the MPPC will host a summer school in computational plasma physics at Princeton University within the current period of funding.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by NSF's Divisions of Physics and Astronomy (Mathematical & Physicsal Sciences Directorate), and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

Non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas are powerful sources for reactive chemical species that can have profound biological effects, but the sources are complex, poorly understood, and are difficult to design and control. Our knowledge of the nature of the plasma-biomaterial interaction using such atmospheric pressure plasma sources is especially inadequate. This work combines plasma source characterization/simulations, plasma-surface (tissue) treatments/in-situ surface characterization with biological assay methodologies, and various characterization approaches, including magnetic resonance characterization of solid state and solution macromolecules. The broader impacts of this project go beyond the establishment of baseline methodologies that can be used to characterize and control interactions of APP sources with biological targets. As an enabling technology, approaches and concepts unveiled in this work can be broadly applied in diverse applications where the biological environment must be well-controlled, e.g. disinfection of packaging for food and medicines, modification of biological systems, cells and tissue, including the field of plasma medicine. The principles under study in this project are also relevant to all applications of APP for surface functionalization of organic materials such as polymers.<br/><br/>The project's first objective is to obtain a fundamental understanding of how fluxes of reactive species produced in two representative APP devices depend on source type, operating parameters and environmental conditions using relevant chemistries. The second objective is to expose selected biomolecules to well controlled species from these APP sources to induce atomistic modifications of the biomolecules. The changes in biomolecule properties (chemical, morphological etc) along with alterations in biological function will be characterized using an array of complementary methods. Furthermore, modifications in biological function will be correlated with the results of the comprehensive materials/surface characterizations to provide underlying chemical and biological mechanisms. The third objective is to obtain a scientific understanding of how water modulates APP-biomolecule interactions to affect its biological function. This includes establishment of differences in APP species fluxes, chemical/morphological changes in biomolecules, and their biological responses to bio-assays when water is present either in the gas stream passing through the APP source, the environment (humidity) or as a liquid on the surface of the biomolecule. The fourth objective is experimental validation of current computational efforts on simulating atomic-scale modifications of specific model biomolecules by reactive species produced by APP sources. This will be based on investigating biomolecules for which atomic-scale simulations of the interaction of reactive plasma species with these biomolecules have either been published, or are currently ongoing."

By this point hundreds of antiatoms have been trapped for times as long as 1000 s. While this was a remarkable achievement, the ALPHA apparatus is not well configured for most measurements of the properties of antihydrogen, and must be rebuilt to allow laser and better microwave access. Furthermore, the trapping rates, while sufficient to begin studies of the properties of antimatter, are lower than optimal. There are two broad challenges to improving the trapping rate: (1) Understanding the behavior of the positron and antiproton plasmas from which the antihydrogen is synthesized; and (2) Understanding the atomic processes by which positrons and antiprotons recombine. Antihydrogen synthesis lies on the boundary between atomic and plasma physics, and cannot be studied properly without employing tools from both fields. The long term goal of antihydrogen research is to search for differences between the properties of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences might occur between the spectra of the two species. Differences in the spectra could only result from CPT violation. Another place differences might occur is in the gravitational interactions of hydrogen and antihydrogen. Such differences could solve the baryogenesis problem. A third area of potential difference is in the fractional charge of antihydrogen. The net charge of antihydrogen is only known to about 10^-7 relative to the unit charge. Positive results from any of these measurements would completely change our understanding of fundamental particles and fields. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and 3D PIC codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics. <br/><br/>The long-term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. The trapping of antihydrogen last year was extraordinarily widely noted in the lay and scientific press. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimentalists learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, UHV practice, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theorists can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program.

Turbulent mixing of ionized gas, called plasma, is especially fascinating when the plasma is embedded inside a strong magnetic force field. Mixing of magnetized plasma has special geometric relationships, couples energy from small and large sized vortex-like structures know as ""eddies,"" and creates self-organization through a remarkable turbulent ""pinch."" A collaboration between two universities will operate two unique facilities, called laboratory magnetospheres, that contain high-temperature ionized gas using a magnetic force field that resembles the field that surround our Earth and other planets. New measurements will be combined with new theories and simulations that will answer unresolved questions including: How do plasma eddies couple energy at different sizes? How do plasmas evolve during turbulent mixing? What mechanisms cause turbulent self-organization? New science will advance including: (1) global imaging and control of turbulent interchange mixing in a variety of plasma conditions, (2) study of electrostatic self-organization through the understanding of the turbulent pinch, and (3) validating our models for lowfrequency turbulence by carrying out self-consistent nonlinear simulations of turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres.<br/><br/>This research has broad impact because turbulent mixing of magnetized plasma is ubiquitous and fundamental. Understanding turbulent mixing in laboratory magnetospheres will improve our understanding of (1) processes occurring in the ionosphere, which is important to satellite communication, (2) turbulence inside the central regions of planetary magnetospheres, which is important to space weather models, and (3) the anisotropic mixing of low-dimensional fluid systems, which is important to industrial processes. Additionally, this collaborative research uses state-of-the-art facilities at highly-regarded research universities to motivate students and scientists to explore plasma dynamics in a magnetic configuration that resembles a magnetosphere and to encourage the next generation of scientists able to understand and control high-temperature, ionized matter."

Nearly a half of the manufacturing steps necessary to fabricate a computer microprocessor employ plasmas. The interaction of plasmas with materials depends on the region close to the surfaces known as the plasma sheath.

What happens to the anisotropy of ion velocity distribution functions (IVDFs) along the presheath and at the sheath-edge? 3. Why do experimental transverse IVDF results differ from simulations? 4.

The plasma structure is created using either ultra-short laser pulses or particle beams. This technique offers a way to build high performance particle accelerators of much smaller size than conventional accelerator techniques. <br/><br/>This award will further develop Laser-Plasma accelerators (LPA). Applications of LPA electron beams require capture, transport, and manipulation of the electron beam following exit of the plasma accelerator. This award will investigate two aspects of beam dynamics following the plasma accelerator that are critical to future applications:<br/> 1. Coupling of the LPA beam into conventional beam transport systems.<br/> 2. Beam decompression to enable light source applications.<br/><br/>This work will benefit most applications of LPA beams, in particular for high energy physics and light source applications. The production of high-energy particle beams for particle physics applications requires the staging of multiple LPAs, and the proposed research will directly impact the design of the LPA beam coupling system between stages. An LPA driven Free Electron Laser (FEL) is considered one of the most promising near-term applications of LPA technology, and this research will lay the groundwork for the first proof-of-principle demonstration of an LPA-driven FEL generating coherent, high-peak brightness x-rays.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this award lies in the development of practical LPA applications such as future high-energy physics beams for exploration of new physics. This will be done by exploring solutions to the two issues mentioned above. First, the use of tailored plasma profiles will be investigated to reduce the beam divergence, enabling improved coupling to a conventional beam transport system. Second, by exploring Free-Electron lasers (FEL). LPAs deliver high peak current beams, and, hence, it is natural to consider LPA beams as drivers for FELs. Although the FEL application is presently hindered by the energy spread (few percent) of the LPA electron beam, application of LPA beams to FELs may be accomplished using experimentally-demonstrated LPA beam properties by beam phase space manipulation following the LPA. This project considers decompression of the femtosecond LPA beam, reducing the beam slice energy spread, enabling FEL lasing."

Plasmas in and in contact with liquids are one of the most exciting and important intellectual frontiers in plasma science, with broad potential applications ranging from environmental remediation and green chemistry to biomedical applications. The complex interaction of plasmas with liquids offers a rich source of short-lived chemically reactive species, many of which are critical for chemical and biological applications. Plasmas are often considered to be an advanced oxidation technology for liquid waste treatment and also have great promise in the destruction of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. The presence of these pharmaceuticals in the water supply is an increasing public concern and for several cases no alternative technologies exist to remove them from drinking water. In addition, plasmas in liquids can be used for environmentally friendly chemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen and even nanoparticles. Producing hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide from water with better energy efficiency than electrolysis or other chemical processes would be a major step forward. The nanoparticles in the context of advanced material science could also strongly affect energy research that increasingly uses complex nanostructured materials. <br/><br/>Since energy efficiency is often a bottleneck for applications of plasmas in liquids, a better understanding of the reactive species production in these plasmas is the necessary step to lead to a breakthrough in technologies based on plasmas in liquids. To date, progress in the field of plasmas in liquids has been hindered by the lack of quantitative correlations between plasma properties and the plasma induced liquid phase chemistry. The key idea of this project is to generate a non-equilibrium plasma filament in liquid water by a nanosecond pulsed high voltage supply in a needle-needle electrode geometry. This offers an excellent control of the plasma dynamics and allows detailed investigation of a stabilized plasma filament. The short-lived reactive species production mechanisms will be investigated both temporally and spatially resolved by a combination of advanced laser diagnostics. In addition, plasma induced liquid reactivity will be measured and a direct link between plasma chemistry and liquid phase chemistry will be established. This is expected to lead to the necessary knowledge for optimizing and establishing many promising applications as stated above. This project enables education of students and a post-doctoral researcher in the cross-disciplinary field of plasma engineering. The outcomes of this work will be used to extend an existing graduate course on Plasma Technology to cover non-equilibrium liquid phase plasmas including laboratory demonstrations. Within the framework of the project, collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota will be initiated to establish an exhibit about plasmas."

Our understanding of the atmospheric microplasmas and the nature of the plasma interaction with biological matter is very limited. In this project, we will, in particular, advance the knowledge of atmospheric microplasmas relevant for medical applications. This research program will serve as a vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of plasma science. The PIs will make a concerted effort to involve women and under-represented minority students in this project by working closely with the relevant student organizations at George Washington University. To recruit women, the Society of Women Engineers will be contacted and informed of the project activities. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research through the Work Study program or a Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement. The experience will impart them with the knowledge and the skills to excel in independent academic or industry careers they pursue after completing their education. The educational plan for this project also aims to generate interest in science and technology in the area of plasma science and bioengineering and to reach out to K-12 teachers, school children and their parents. In particular, we plan to interact with local schools in the Metropolitan DC area.<br/><br/>The central objective of this project is to understand the underlying physics of non-equilibrium atmospheric microplasmas with a view towards biological applications. To this end we will develop and implement a wide range of new diagnostic methodologies and tools applicable for atmospheric microplasmas.

One can measure just how violent a collision is by comparing the energy of the crashing high-speed ions with the electrical force between them. The most violent ion collisions, the ones that are most important both for extending our scientific knowledge and for developing technological applications, are very difficult to measure or calculate. They occur in extremely hot and very dense gases of charged particles called plasmas. In this project, new ideas will be used to measure and understand these collisions. Lasers will be used to slow atoms from speeds of nearly 1000 meters per second to a crawl of about an inch per second; and then to turn these slow atoms into ions. Additional lasers will then be used to measure how these ions crash into each other. The ions in these slow-motion collisions have the same amount of crash energy compared to the ion-ion electrical force, which means that the collision results can be directly compared to similar collisions at any energy. This project will use state-of-the-art large-scale computer simulations to make movies of the ion-ion collisions and compare these to the experimental measurements. When the computations are proven to be sufficiently accurate, approximations will be gradually introduced and tested in order to speed up the computations. These results will then set the standard for accurate and fast computations of ion collisions in plasmas. Several students will work on this project: Undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral scientists will work closely with expert scientists at Willamette University (Oregon), Brigham Young University (Utah), and the New Mexico Consortium (New Mexico).<br/><br/>The proposed collaborative research project will investigate energy relaxation in a system in which the value of the Coulomb logarithm is small. This is typical of high-energy-density systems, where violent small-impact-parameter collisions result in large particle deflections. Understanding these collisions is a priority for advancing fundamental plasma physics and for accurately modeling small impact parameter collisions in high energy density plasmas. The proposed work will generate high quality data in plasma regimes where traditional diagnostics are limited. The proposed work will combine data from a new dual-species ultracold neutral plasma experiment and state-of-the-art simulations to study temperature equilibration in moderately coupled plasmas, in which classic plasma assumptions are invalid. The dual-species plasma will be generated by resonantly photo-ionizing laser-cooled Yb and Ca atoms in the same magneto-optical trap. Laser-induced fluorescence measurements will be used to measure the time-evolving ion velocity distribution for each ion species simultaneously. By delaying the ionization of one species relative to the other, the time scale for full energy relaxation can be determined. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations will be performed that match the density, stoichiometry, and geometry of the experiments. The calculations will provide a first-principles description of collision processes by directly integrating many-body trajectories. Arbitrarily complicated orbits will be computed self-consistently with dynamical many-body screening. The many-body phase dynamics will be inverted to yield highly accurate effective Coulomb logarithms, providing important information back to the high energy density community. This project will support one graduate student per year for three years at BYU, two undergraduate students per year at BYU, two undergraduate students per year at WU, and one post-doc per year for two years at NMC."

It is also ubiquitous in magnetized laboratory plasmas. Its ubiquity, perhaps second to no other plasma phenomenon, is matched by the scientific challenge of its understanding.<br/><br/>The proposed Magnetic Reconnection Device (MRD) will be a multi-user, multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional instrument that will open up new physics regimes for controlled experimental study of magnetic reconnection, regimes that are otherwise unavailable in a controlled laboratory setting. MRD will allow access to dimensionless physics parameters orders of magnitude beyond that presently obtained in dedicated reconnection experiments, increasing the dimensionless electrical conductivity by two orders of magnitude and the dimensionless size by one order of magnitude. This introduces new physics, beyond the standard single-reconnection-site models, that is believed to be active and crucial in nearly all plasmas of interest (space, solar, astrophysical, fusion). The instrument will allow study of the major open questions in reconnection physics: Why is reconnection so fast? When do multiple reconnections occur and how do they affect the reconnection rate? How does partial ionization affect reconnection? How do 3D geometries alter reconnection? What causes the onset of reconnection? How does reconnection accelerate particles to high energy? <br/><br/>Progress in these questions is impeded in other venues: in space observations by the small number of in-situ measurements, in solar and astrophysical observations by the limited spatial resolution of remote sensors, in fusion lab plasmas by limited detector accessibility, and in dedicated reconnection experiments by limitations in dimensionless physics parameters. MRD avoids all these limitations, offering a new instrument designed to discover new insights in reconnection physics. <br/><br/>The interdisciplinarity of this project lies in the marriage of expertise from the areas where is magnetic reconnection is known to occur. That is in the areas spanning a wide variety of spatial scales from astrophysics, to solar physics, to magnetospheric physics, and down to laboratory plasma (fusion physics) scales. Undergraduate plasma physics programs will also be enriched by the availability to do research on the MRD at such institutions as Princeton University, and Swarthmore and Wheaton colleges."

These plasmas exhibit all of the hallmarks of complexity in physical systems. As particles nucleate and grow they become increasingly charged, profoundly affecting the plasma and setting in motion a set of nonlinear couplings between the nanoparticle cloud and the plasma which are now unpredictable. They are of practical interest, because nanoparticles are a major source of contamination in semiconductor processing and because of the use of plasmas to synthesize nanoparticles for a wide variety of applications, ranging from photovoltaics to cancer treatment. In this project a cyber infrastructure will be developed that will underpin the development of numerical models of nanodusty plasmas. With this cyber infrastructure, heretofore unresolved phenomena in these highly complex systems will be investigated.<br/>The project involves a collaboration that will advance several different fields of science and engineering, bringing together expertise in computational modeling of chemically reacting plasmas and plasma transport, particle nucleation and growth, aerosol dynamics and computational chemistry. It draws on staff and resources of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute and supercomputer facilities at Pacific Northwest and Argonne National Laboratories, and involves collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories on the development of computational techniques for parallelization of hybrid particle-fluid models. The cyber platform to be developed will build upon the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM), developed by one of the PIs, by implementing a hierarchy of physics and chemistry modules to address the complexity of particle nucleation and growth and aerosol dynamics. Leveraging the HPEM's existing industrial user base, the project has a strong component of technology transfer, including possible commercialization with an industrial partner. The project also has an international dimension, collaborating with two research groups in France.<br/><br/>The project will develop numerical models of nanodusty plasmas as well as a cyber infrastructure to facilitate these models and make these new tools generally available. The project will produce the first-ever numerical models that self-consistently account for all of these interacting phenomena: particle nucleation, growth and charging in a multi-dimensional plasma; nanoparticle transport; plasma chemistry; electron and ion kinetics; and the collective mutual effects of nanoparticles on a plasma. The development of such models is a challenging undertaking, made more so by the paucity of needed fundamental data on properties and reactivities of small clusters, and by the fact that real plasma systems are typically three-dimensional. Tackling these problems is ambitious from the viewpoint of physics and chemistry, many aspects of which are poorly understood, and from the computational viewpoint, as vast ranges of length and time scales are involved, with strongly coupled interacting subsystems and nonlinear behavior. The development of a cyber infrastructure that enables accurate simulations of real nanodusty plasmas will mark a major paradigm shift.<br/><br/>Graduate students and postdocs involved in the project will work in an interdisciplinary environment that bridges the cultures of engineering and science. The project includes the development of a cyber infrastructure to be made available to researchers in academia and national labs, transfer of technology to industry through software licensing, and international collaborations. Through the development of interactive Web-based graphical user interfaces, real-time 3-D visualization, and massively parallel computing, the project will transform the study of nanodusty plasmas, with benefits to researchers in advancing fundamental understanding, to the semiconductor industry in developing strategies to avoid nanoparticle contamination, and to the creation of engineered nanoparticles for applications such as photovoltaics and cancer treatment.<br/><br/>This is a Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation Program award and is co-funded by the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the CISE directorate, the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the MPS directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering."

Accretion through a swirling disk concerns many astronomical phenomena on scales from distant quasars to nearby star systems. This novel and innovative experiment will also provide many educational opportunities.<br/><br/>This project will be the first ever study of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a plasma experiment. Although the MRI is a major component of current explanations of accretion, studies have so far been theoretical, numerical, and with a limited set of liquid metal experiments. This study will use the Plasma Couette Experiment (PCX), which uses a new way both to confine and to stir hot, fast-flowing plasmas under the right conditions to observe the MRI, which explains how matter in an accretion disk transports angular momentum outward, and thus falls into the central object. A weak magnetic field from somewhere outside the disk leads to a quickly growing magnetic instability that itself leads to turbulence, which enhances the effective viscosity. Numerical simulations have shown an effect of exactly the required sort, and recent experiments with liquid metals have studied the onset conditions. However, plasma experiments have several key advantages over liquid metals: (1) plasmas are the state of matter that makes up most naturally occurring accretion disks; (2) plasmas can be configured with more appropriate fluid parameters; and (3) plasma viscosity can be varied independently of the conductivity, mimicking conditions both in the outer regions of most disks, and in the regime near the center. The PCX is now being upgraded to stronger confining magnets, higher input power, and larger plasma volume. These improvements should more effectively show the onset of the MRI, and even multi-mode MRI turbulence. This award will support (1) a search for signs of the instability and its comparison with numerical simulations; (2) measurement of the effective momentum transport to compare with theoretical predictions; and (3) identification of physics effects which are plasma specific and beyond the standard model.<br/><br/>Among the outreach activities, a basic plasma experiment will be added to the undergraduate physics capstone lab class. The popular ""Exotic Plasmas of the Universe"" trading cards will be updated, and plasma astrophysics themes will be part of the university's ""Wonders of Physics"" show."

Turbulence can drive increased transport of particles, heat, and momentum, which affects our ability to confine plasmas for applications on Earth, such as fusion energy, and can play an important role in accelerating particles to high energies, for example in the space weather environment comprising the Sun and Earth. The large numbers of high energy particles generated during space weather events have the potential to seriously impact satellites, communications, and power systems on Earth. Being able to reliably predict such events requires a detailed understanding of the underlying physics, including the physics of turbulence and the interaction of turbulence and flows. <br/><br/>The goal of this work is to validate, through controlled laboratory experiments and close experiment-theory-model coupling, a fully global, nonlinear two-fluid model appropriate for understanding turbulence and transport dynamics in a collisional laboratory plasma.

Even in these 'simple' laboratory experiments, enough complicating physics are present so that interpreting measurements purely experimentally, via quasilinear theories, or via local nonlinear models seems to be difficult or impossible. The proposed experiments will take place in the dual-source HelCat (Helicon-Cathode) device at the University of New Mexico.

Laser plasmas, therefore, are of interest for a number of applications including ignition. We will develop the basic plasma science to provide tailored laser pulse schemes for ignition and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) applications. In terms of combustion, laser ignition has many potential benefits. For reciprocating natural gas engines one can ignite leaner mixtures (reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation) and higher pressure mixtures (leading to higher engine efficiencies and fuel-savings). In aerospace applications one can achieve better relight in aero-turbines. The multi-pulse approaches may lower the burden on required laser sources and fiber delivery implementations. We will present our activities to local minority-serving public schools (K-12) and include research advances in courses at our universities. We will specifically target underrepresented or minority groups to work on the project as their Ph.D. thesis research.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The proposed research focuses on innovative approaches employing pre-ionizing pulses (ns-ps-fs) to enhance and control laser plasma formation in gases. In particular, we will examine cases in which an initial pulse is used to achieve pre-ionization, and is followed by a second pulse that provides controllable energy addition. The energy addition of the second pulse is enabled by pre-ionization due to the first pulse. The result will be a laser plasma that is not at full breakdown conditions (i.e. no spark), but that has elevated temperature (>~2000 K). Such laser plasmas can provide novel and improved ignition sources by avoiding the unnecessarily high temperatures, strong shock waves, and elevated laser pulse energies that accompany full laser breakdown (sparks). We will consider a range of pulse durations (ns-ps-fs) as well as both non-resonant and resonant schemes for pre-ionization. We will also study both non-resonant pre-ionizing pulses as well as Resonant Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) schemes. The REMPI schemes will be developed for future applications in air with initial studies in synthetic gas mixtures, e.g. we will study REMPI of argon and oxygen which are abundant in air. The plasmas will be experimentally studied and characterized as well as modeled numerically. We will determine optimal laser pulse parameters (wavelength, duration, temporal separation etc.) to provide sufficient pre-ionization and to allow subsequent energy addition. Owing to the lack of visible emission, the study of such plasmas is challenging and a key feature of our proposal is the use of a newly developed microwave scattering technique to measure electron parameters. The proposed research will be transformative in terms of laser plasma formation; despite a large body of research in laser breakdown using single laser pulses there has been minimal research on multi-pulse approaches and pre-ionization. The three-year program will be conducted by Colorado State University (CSU), University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK), and Princeton University (PU) and combines experimental studies, advanced diagnostics, and computational plasma and combustion modeling."

It has been observed that when the shear in the flow -- either ""equilibrium"" ExB flows, or turbulent Reynolds stress self-driven (zonal) flows -- is sufficiently large, turbulence and/or turbulent transport can be reduced or suppressed. The high confinement mode (H-mode) widely observed in toroidal fusion devices is one example of such flow shear suppression. There has been a significant amount of work, including experimental, computational, and theoretical, on understanding the interactions between fully developed turbulence (and its associated transport) and flow shear. However, since the observed transitions to suppressed or reduced turbulence states typically occur on very fast time scales, little has been done experimentally to elucidate the detailed nonlinear dynamics of this transition. Because of the difficulty in observing the dynamics, a theoretical understanding of the transition is also lacking, since few detailed tests of models have been possible.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to improve the understanding of the detailed dynamics of transitions between states of unstable drift fluctuations (including broadband turbulence) and fluctuation-suppressed states in a controlled laboratory environment. Experiments, which are being conducted in the dual-source HelCat (Helicon-Cathode) device at the University of New Mexico (UNM), are investigating the effects of controlled magnetic shear and magnetic X-points on these dynamics, as well as the detailed effects of electrode biasing. These experiments are being complemented by direct comparisons with a fully nonlinear global Braginskii code, as well as other computational tools. The primary numerical code, a fully 3D global (full plasma equilibrium and fluctuations), is being used to model and understand both large-scale equilibrium flows and fluctuations. This code is complemented by a linear stability code, which will be used to interpret the nature of the fluctuations, and a 1D, 3V particle in cell (PIC) code to understand the details of the plasma potential profile as electrodes are biased to arbitrary voltages to affect flows. Additionally, measurements and simulations from the linear HelCat device are being compared with those from the toroidal TORPEX basic plasma device at the Centre de Recherche en Physique des Plasmas, cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (CRPP-EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland.<br/><br/>The international research team includes researchers from UNM, the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and CRPP-EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland (who are participating at no cost to NSF). The team is composed of full-time faculty, graduate and undergraduate student researchers, including female and minority students, and thus has a strong STEM educational component.

For reciprocating natural gas engines one can ignite leaner mixtures (reducing NOx emissions and pollutant formation) and higher pressure mixtures (leading to higher engine efficiencies and fuel-savings). In aerospace applications one can achieve better relight in aero-turbines. The multi-pulse approaches may lower the burden on required laser sources and fiber delivery implementations. We will present our activities to local minority-serving public schools (K-12) and include research advances in courses at our universities. We will specifically target underrepresented or minority groups to work on the project as their Ph.D. thesis research.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The proposed research focuses on innovative approaches employing pre-ionizing pulses (ns-ps-fs) to enhance and control laser plasma formation in gases. In particular, we will examine cases in which an initial pulse is used to achieve pre-ionization, and is followed by a second pulse that provides controllable energy addition. The energy addition of the second pulse is enabled by pre-ionization due to the first pulse. The result will be a laser plasma that is not at full breakdown conditions (i.e. no spark), but that has elevated temperature (>~2000 K). Such laser plasmas can provide novel and improved ignition sources by avoiding the unnecessarily high temperatures, strong shock waves, and elevated laser pulse energies that accompany full laser breakdown (sparks). We will consider a range of pulse durations (ns-ps-fs) as well as both non-resonant and resonant schemes for pre-ionization. We will also study both non-resonant pre-ionizing pulses as well as Resonant Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) schemes. The REMPI schemes will be developed for future applications in air with initial studies in synthetic gas mixtures, e.g. we will study REMPI of argon and oxygen which are abundant in air. The plasmas will be experimentally studied and characterized as well as modeled numerically. We will determine optimal laser pulse parameters (wavelength, duration, temporal separation etc.) to provide sufficient pre-ionization and to allow subsequent energy addition. Owing to the lack of visible emission, the study of such plasmas is challenging and a key feature of our proposal is the use of a newly developed microwave scattering technique to measure electron parameters. The proposed research will be transformative in terms of laser plasma formation; despite a large body of research in laser breakdown using single laser pulses there has been minimal research on multi-pulse approaches and pre-ionization. The three-year program will be conducted by Colorado State University (CSU), University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK), and Princeton University (PU) and combines experimental studies, advanced diagnostics, and computational plasma and combustion modeling."

It is the leading international conference in the science and technology of Low Temperature Plasmas (LTP) combined with collision physics (CP). The GEC combines aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with low-temperature plasma physics, electric discharges, and plasma chemistry, as well as their technological applications. Fundamental topics addressed at the GEC include atomic and molecular collision cross sections, plasma diagnostics, ion and electron distribution functions, as well as kinetic, particle-in-cell (PIC), and fluid plasma modeling. The conference has been the venue of the first presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTP and CP topics including advanced combustion systems, lighting and lasers, plasma materials processing of relevance to the semiconductor and photovoltaics industry, and plasma application in biomedicine. The invited speakers represent the world's leading scientists in these fields. The future of any field depends upon attracting bright young people. The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation, and has an enviable reputation of being the first conference where many of the leading members of the community presented their first research results as graduate students. <br/><br/>This award will pay partial travel support for 13 PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the 68th Annual GEC meeting to be held Monday, October 12 - Friday, October 16, 2015 in Honolulu, Hawaii. This will be a joint meeting with the International Conference on Reactive Plasmas normally held in Japan. Hawaii was chosen as the venue since it is located roughly in the middle between the US mainland and Japan. These two distinct meetings are expected to attract more than 600 plasma scientists, collision physicists, and engineers to the same convention center. This award will provide the opportunity for PhD students to establish peer to peer collaboration with researchers from around the world. The GEC, being a moderate size conference, presents an environment where collaborate research efforts and future endeavors are often initiated. The students will have the opportunity to observe first-hand the scientific and cultural diversity of the field, and establish what will hopefully be career long collaborations with their international counterparts. The GEC makes a special effort to support graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities."

The sense of the CMSO research mission is captured by two large questions: Why is the universe magnetized? How do magnetic fields affect the structure of plasmas? CMSO encompasses and is organized around four, coupled processes: magnetic reconnection, dynamo effects, momentum transport, and magnetic turbulence. The heart of the effort is focused on answering fundamental questions in each area through experiment, computation, and theory, and applying the understanding to important astrophysical problems. <br/><br/>These physics problems are addressed by a team of scientists from seven institutions that collectively provide unique tools (seven experiments and an arsenal of computational resources) and great breadth of expertise from the lab to astrophysics, and from experiment to theory to computation. The member institutions are the University of Wisconsin, Princeton University and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of Chicago, the University of New Hampshire, Swarthmore College, and Science Applications International Corporation. Participating experiments include three toroidal plasma experiments that exhibit many features of self-organization: the MST reversed field pinch (Wisconsin) and two merging plasma experiments, MRX (Princeton) and SSX (Swarthmore); two linear experiments for line-tied reconnection: RSX (Los Alamos), RWX (Wisconsin); and two liquid metal experiments: the MRI experiment (Princeton) for studying the magnetorotational instability, and the Madison Dynamo Experiment. National laboratory participation (Los Alamos, Princeton) will be supported by DOE, as is the experimental infrastructure; thus, CMSO is very much a partnership between NSF and DOE. <br/><br/>The educational outreach program is based on The Wonders of Physics lecture-demonstration program through the University of Wisconsin. Under the auspices of this program CMSO representatives make over 100 presentations per year reaching an audience of school children and the general public of 10,000 persons per year. In the past year, presentations were made to 2000 African American children through specially targeted presentations and extensively to Native Americans and rural communities."

These objects are expressed as special solutions to mathematical models involving partial differential equations and have been widely used in various scientific disciplines. They are for instance of fundamental importance in biology, engineering, and physics. Utilizing boundary layer theory, engineers are able to significantly simplify the analysis of fluid flows near a solid body, such as a ship, or an airplane. This has proven exceptionally useful in aerodynamics. The PI will develop mathematical tools to study the validity of boundary layer simplifications of viscous flows, and thereby provide a deeper understanding of physical observations and laboratory experiments. The PI will also establish mathematical criteria, under which coherent structures in oscillatory media and equilibria of a plasma are well behaved under disturbances. The search for a stability criterion is important in practice, for instance, in helping engineers design stable devices, which could otherwise be damaged by unstable waves. <br/><br/>The research focuses on mathematical questions concerned with the dynamics of boundary layers in fluid dynamics, the stability of coherent structures in oscillatory media, and the magnetic confinement of a plasma. The mathematical equations to be considered include the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, general reaction-diffusion systems, and the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell systems. Generic boundary layers of the Navier-Stokes equations are analytically shown to be spectrally unstable for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. The PI will develop a nonlinear theory, building on the Fourier-Laplace transformed approach and the Evans function techniques, to prove the invalidity of boundary layer approximations in the vanishing viscosity limit. The research will also provide an understanding of the complete dynamics of nonlinear solutions near spectrally stable source defects. The PI will develop a novel nonlinear iteration scheme to study the stability properties of time-periodic traveling wave solutions, based on the spatial-dynamics techniques and the pointwise one-dimensional Green's function approach. Finally, the PI will initiate new investigations on magnetic mechanisms to confine a plasma modeled by the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell systems."

Wound contamination and infection are notoriously challenging to treat and are a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Bacterial and other microbial colonization in wounds delay healing, cause further degradation, and can lead to severe complications including deep tissue and bone infections, as well as stroke and sepsis. The wound care field is large and diverse and includes acute and chronic wounds, pre- and post-surgical care and scar prevention, burns, as well as emergency wound care in war settings and homeland security. Due to the aging population and increasing rates of diabetes and obesity, the entire global wound care products market is expanding rapidly at an estimated 7% per year and currently totals over $21B. Moreover, new financial reimbursement policies to reduce the estimated $50B US economic burden of wounds are incentivizing hospitals to improve care, reduce infection, and accelerate patient recovery. The market is ripe for a medical technology that treats wound infections.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports the development of a high voltage power supply capable of driving a cold plasma medical device that treats wound infections. Cold plasma is ideal for treating wound infections because it is effective against all bacteria types and is unlikely to confer bacterial resistance. It is superior in its anti-microbial effect compared to topical antibiotics and antiseptics but safe for human skin. Our research objectives include scaling the output voltage, shortening pulse width, enabling thermal, overvoltage, and overcurrent protections, and incorporating voltage control feedback. Anticipated technical results include completion of these research objectives and testing of the power supply with the cold plasma device on bacterial cultures to confirm antibacterial effects."

These galaxy clusters are teeming with activity as the recurring infall of dark matter dominated halos drives large scale winds, shocks, turbulence and entropy discontinuities in the intracluster medium (ICM). The diffuse, hot ICM, comprising about 90% of the normal cluster matter, carries the imprint of the recent cluster assembly history, provides a cosmological mass metric through its dynamical/thermodynamical state, transports metals and entropy, transforms galactic star formation, and offers a laboratory into basic fluid and plasma processes in low density media. Relativistic, nonthermal plasmas produced by cluster-wide processes and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) serve as an important tool for understanding the ICM's evolving dynamical state. Exploiting this tool requires a rich observational base, a good understanding of the physics of the interactions between thermal and nonthermal plasmas, and effective ways to translate between that physics and observations. To that end, the investigators have designed an ambitious, coordinated theoretical and observational program that will leverage major technical advances in both numerical simulations and telescope systems.<br/><br/>The aims of this project include a much improved understanding of (1) how large scale flows and turbulence are established in the ICM and evolve from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, (2) how magnetic fields develop and then reveal and feed back to ICM evolution, (3) how relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) are both products of and diagnostics for the dynamic ICM, and (4) how AGN outflows physically interact with the ICM and serve as diagnostics of local flows.<br/><br/>Educationally, this project includes training of undergraduate and graduate students in both cutting-edge science and the development of innovative data analysis and numerical simulation techniques. The investigators will also be active in public education, including work with the local planetarium, K-12 science and community groups."

Recently, the PI discovered that these junctions function as trafficking hubs for insertion and removal of plasma membrane proteins. Furthermore, the PI has found that the voltage gated potassium channel Kv2.1 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum, dramatically increasing ER/PM junction surface area and structurally changing the junction morphology. The PI's findings show that the Kv2.1 potassium channel remodels to cortical ER, which is likely within 30 nm of the plasma membrane. Kv2.1 is playing a structural role similar to that of Orai, for the PI proposes that Kv2.1 is binding an ER membrane protein. Thus, Kv2.1-mediated ER enrichment on the cell surface is a novel specialized organelle with specific functions in protein transport vital to cell signaling. <br/><br/>The current project focuses on understanding the biology of ER/PM junctions with particular emphasis on the regulation of the ER/PM junction structure and its function in the modulation of membrane protein trafficking. The PI will answer the following questions: What is the role of Kv2.1 in protein trafficking at ER/PM junctions? How are ER/PM junctions dynamically regulated by Kv2.1? What are the relationships between the cortical cytoskeleton, ER, and Kv2.1? Which theoretical framework can be used to describe the assembly and maintenance of these domains? How does large-scale membrane behavior emerge from the interactions between Kv2.1 and ER? The fusion of multicolor single-molecule tracking in living cells and advanced stochastic process analysis, which are integral to the project, will provide answer to these questions. This research will offer excellent opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student participation in interdisciplinary research through the collaboration between two laboratories with very different backgrounds.

Energetic plasma interacting with the geomagnetic field in the near-Earth space (geospace) environment emits electromagnetic waves across the radio spectrum, and ground-based measurements of these waves are used as diagnostic tools to investigate various processes in geospace. This investigation takes advantage of an existing network of radio receivers located in Antarctica from -70 to -85 degrees of invariant geomagnetic latitude and operating in the frequency range from extra low to high frequencies (ELF ~300 Hz to HF ~5 MHz). The Antarctic continent is ideally suited for these types of natural radio wave experiments since it is largely devoid of anthropogenic electromagnetic interference such as power line harmonics and radio frequency broadcast transmissions. The project will focus on studies of three geophysically important plasma waves. The first, chorus wave is believed to be a major driver of radiation belt electron acceleration and loss. The other two waves, auroral hiss and auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), are generated in the auroral acceleration region and have the potential to be used for remote sensing of this complex and poorly understood near-Earth region. The proposed studies are motivated by a recent, exciting detection of AKR on the Earth?s surface which was unexpected since the currently accepted theory for these waves generation predicts beaming of the radiation only outward away from Earth. This research also contributes to the training and education of both the young scientists and undergraduate students."

Chorus waves are radio waves in the acoustic frequency range. If converted to acoustic waves they sound like whistling or chirping, hence the name. Fine structures in the waveform called rising and falling tones are the source of these chirping sounds. The rising tones have received a lot of attention, with several mechanisms suggested for their formation. Not so for the falling tones. This project will investigate further a new mechanism for the generation of falling tones and examine the interaction of radiation belts electron with chorus - both rising and falling tones. Research into these waves benefits not only the field of space physics but also plasma physics and fusion. In addition the project will provide training for a postdoctoral student and research support for an early-career scientist (the proposer) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. <br/><br/>There are significant differences in the mechanisms that have been proposed to generate chorus (focusing mostly on rising tones) compared to the new mechanism suggested for falling tones. Most current theories conclude that plasma density variations and/or inhomogeneity of the magnetic field are necessary to generate chorus. In fact, for rising tone chorus, simulations show that spectral characteristics of the chorus are directly related to the geomagnetic field inhomogeneity. However, the falling tone waves have much more oblique wave normal angles and, as a result, more resonances with plasma electrons are possible. Competition between resonances that cause growth and damping of the waves can make them marginally stable, resulting in nonlinear effects that produce chirping. This new picture of falling tone chorus generation along with scattering of electrons by chorus will be investigated through the combined use of analytic model developments and computational particle in cell (PIC) and Tristan-mp code runs. The roles of various plasma parameters will be determined from runs of a 1D Vlasov code, which solves for the time evolution of the electron distribution."

Turbulence in a magnetized plasma is the primary mechanism responsible for transforming energy at large injection scales into small-scale motions, which are ultimately dissipated as heat in systems such as the solar corona and wind. In this regard, the main purpose of this 3-year SHINE project is to improve present understanding of plasma heating and distribution function dynamics in weakly collisional plasmas using both hybrid and fully kinetic, continuum Vlasov-Maxwell simulations. <br/><br/>This 3-year SHINE project aims to accomplish the following three science objectives. The first objective is to develop a better understanding of the distribution function dynamics related to wave damping in fully non-linear turbulence. The second objective is to examine the behavior of Alfvenic turbulence near the proton scale. The third objective is to determine the relative importance of proton and electron heating in large-scale intermittent structures produced as a natural consequence of turbulence. The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the nature of turbulence in space and astrophysical plasmas. Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of the space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond. <br/><br/>The research outcome of this project may have implications for weakly collisional fusion experiments, and it could provide additional insight into a myriad of heliospheric domains, and be of interest to the astrophysics community. The parameters chosen and the continuum nature of the simulations will provide valuable particle distribution function information for existing and upcoming spacecraft missions, such as Solar Probe Plus. The knowledge gained from this project will aid in the development of improved models of energy transport, which may aid in global modeling of many disparate, large-scale phenomena. The full simulation data from the final stage of the project will be made available to the community to analyze and compare directly to available spacecraft data.

Energetic plasma interacting with the geomagnetic field in the near-Earth space (geospace) environment emits electromagnetic waves across the radio spectrum, and ground-based measurements of these waves are used as diagnostic tools to investigate various processes in geospace. This investigation takes advantage of an existing network of radio receivers located in Antarctica from -70 to -85 degrees of invariant geomagnetic latitude and operating in the frequency range from extra low to high frequencies (ELF ~300 Hz to HF ~5 MHz). The Antarctic continent is ideally suited for these types of natural radio wave experiments since it is largely devoid of anthropogenic electromagnetic interference such as power line harmonics and radio frequency broadcast transmissions. The project will focus on studies of three geophysically important plasma waves. The first, chorus wave is believed to be a major driver of radiation belt electron acceleration and loss. The other two waves, auroral hiss and auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), are generated in the auroral acceleration region and have the potential to be used for remote sensing of this complex and poorly understood near-Earth region. The proposed studies are motivated by a recent, exciting detection of AKR on the Earth?s surface which was unexpected since the currently accepted theory for these waves generation predicts beaming of the radiation only outward away from Earth. This research also contributes to the training and education of both the young scientists and undergraduate students."

These contaminants include pharmaceuticals, personal care products, industrial oils and dyes, pesticides and herbicides, endocrine disruptors, bacteria, protozoa, viruses and chlorine resistant microbes. The objective of this project is to develop and market a water purification unit that uses plasma to rid water of organic contaminants. The plasma?water interaction produces agents that decompose these contaminants via a process call mineralization into carbon dioxide, water and inorganic salts. The novel attribute of the device under development is that it is scalable, accommodating a range of applications from single use and point of use to in-line water finishing as an integrated module in a water treatment plant. Of particular interest is the use of this technology in underdeveloped countries where water treatment infrastructure is lacking. In general, the water treatment industry is large, encompassing four major sectors ranging from wastewater treatment to municipal drinking water. All sectors have identified the need for advanced water treatment methods and the plasma purifier can potentially satisfy their needs. Along with product development, this effort aims to identify the most appropriate market for direct application and ultimately to commercialize the product for use in the water treatment sector. <br/><br/>This project aims to commercialize a novel, plasma-based water treatment method. The application of such a technology encompasses nearly all aspects of water use ranging from domestic drinking water to post treatment of industrial reject water. The approach utilizes advanced oxidation to decompose organic toxins as well as oxidize metal contaminants while addressing inadequacies in current water treatment technology. Though plasma-based water treatment has been investigated in the past, its widespread application has remained an elusive goal. This is due largely to the difficulty in scaling up the approach since water's dielectric properties strongly deter electrical breakdown. However, this approach separates the input feed water into dielectric streams capable of interstitial breakdown. This so-called packed bed discharge arrangement is the key enabling physics for this innovation. Upon application of a voltage pulse, one can achieve breakdown between the streams thereby producing a surface plasma. The surface plasma reacts on the high surface area to volume ratio streams generating radicals that subsequently treat the core water. This approach, therefore, allows for high throughput via multiple water streams and the possibility of once through treatment. The approach can be used as an inline module for water finishing or post treatment applications as well as direct treatment, point-of-use applications. The commercial potential for this technology is high in that it addresses the needs of at least four sectors: 1) municipal drinking water 2) waste water processing 3) industrial runoff and 4) point of use purification for mobile units or underdeveloped regions without water treatment infrastructure. Each of these sectors has a stake in the implementation of advance water treatment methods, not so much as an upgrade but as a necessity to address this emerging contamination problem. In an attempt to satisfy real market needs, the general plan for commercializing this technology is essentially three-fold: 1) customer discovery, 2) market evaluation and 3) development of a strategic partner to market and sell the product. Customer discovery is a key aspect of the I-Corps program. This stage of commercialization is critical in that it identifies concretely the actual customer of the technology beyond any preconceived notions regarding the market. This discovery process also will allow us to educate the potential venders and customers of the attributes of the technology as well as identify desirable attributes of the technology as perceived by the community but not necessarily obvious to us at the moment. In parallel with these efforts, we will refine the apparatus to an advanced engineering model. This aspect is important in that it allows one the ability to make an honest assessment of system cost, construction, energy consumption, and overall capability."

The proposed research program has two primary goals: (1) learn about the physics of the almost entirely unexplored regime of very high temperature, low density plasma in the solar corona; and, (2) use what is learned to find strong constraints on the properties of coronal heating. The program of research presents the opportunity to study a new regime of thermal energy transport, in which the global structure of the plasma must be considered, and to determine how it affects the overall energy balance of the Sun's upper atmosphere. This will be of value to other areas of space plasma physics. By combining what is learned from the hot emission with what is already known from the warm emission, strong constraints will be placed on the properties of coronal heating.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this CAREER project target students at all levels as well as educators. The physics' topics on which this research is based will be incorporated into the solar astrophysics graduate course taught by the PI, from which a graduate student will be recruited specifically to work on this project. The program also provides opportunities for undergraduate participation in research. A major part of this project is a summer school program on key physical science concepts, taught within the context of the Sun, for rising juniors and seniors in the Houston Independent School District, which educates predominantly minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The mode of teaching will be through peer instruction and mentoring in small groups.

As a growth process, LG is widely recognized as a model for the formation of various universal patterns observed in physics and natural sciences such as the growth of bacterial colonies. A new exiting development in this classical area of mathematical physics was the recent discovery of the fact that on the microscopic level, the mechanism of LG is very closely related to the behavior of particles in plasma ensembles. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter. A common form of plasma is seen in neon signs and in fact plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe. These plasma ensembles are described in terms of mathematical objects call random matrices that have complex eigenvalues. The relation of LG and random matrices has been intensively studied on the physical level but many fundamental problems remain open on the mathematical side. The PI, Nikolai Makarov, will focus on several such problems. <br/><br/>The main topics and goals of the study will be the following: the proof of the convergence of rescaled point processes and the description of the universality laws for various types of boundary points in the random normal matrix model (RNM); the proof of the laminarity of Hele-Shaw flows and the rigorous derivation of their integrability properties;the analysis of the dynamics of the Schwarz reflections associated with algebraic droplets in the RNM model. To achieve these goals, the PI will bring together tools and ideas from various areas of mathematics (complex analysis, conformal dynamics, probability theory) and theoretical physics (conformal field theory, non-equilibrium growth phenomenon, disordered systems).

Without this process we would have no portable cell phones, laptop computers and all the other modern marvels we take for granted. Ever smaller feature dimensions will allow more transistors to be packed onto chips, resulting in increased information storage and faster computers. This evolution in chip speed and function has progressed steadily over the past 50 years, following Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles about every 18 months. Recently, while studying reactive ion etching of silicon, a rather startling discovery was made: silicon was etched, even when no reactive ions were present. Careful experiments revealed that this etching was due to photons, originating in the plasma. This in-plasma photo-assisted etching produced etched feature shapes that are not optimum for integrated circuits and thus may prove to be a show-stopper in the burgeoning field of etching with atomic precision. This project will combine experiments and simulations to understand the mechanism of in-plasma photo-assisted etching, and identify conditions to suppress this phenomenon. The study will produce a fundamental understanding of the photo-physics and chemistry at the plasma-semiconductor interface and will have a significant impact in the microelectronics industry as well as the field of nanotechnology, with clear societal benefits.<br/><br/>This systematic investigation of plasma-surface interactions will focus on in-situ photon-plasma synergism, and its effect on etching of semiconductor materials in halogen-containing plasmas. A combination of experiments and simulations will address questions such as: (a) What are the synergistic effects of photons and i) positive ions, ii) electrons, iii) negative ions, iv) halogen atoms? (b) does the sheath potential affect photo-assisted etching rates and if so, how and what is the cause? (c) what is the effect of surface plasmons (plasmonics) in the case of samples patterned with sub-wavelength features? A novel dual plasma reactor will be employed, to provide controlled fluxes of ions, UV-VUV photons, and radicals bombarding the substrate. The UV-VUV light intensity, ion flux and ion energy striking the substrate will be measured through a pinhole on the substrate holder, in a differentially pumped analysis chamber. Self-consistent simulations of the electric field distribution and species (electrons, holes, positive ions) fluxes in the plasma as well as in the solid, and electromagnetic calculations of surface plasmon propagation and absorption will be performed. Simulations coupled with experiments will provide insights in the mechanism of photo-assisted etching for varying substrate bias (potential of the sheath over the semiconductor), photon flux and energy, dopant concentration, as well as nanofeature size and aspect ratio. Finally, attempts will be made to exploit photo-assisted etching of silicon to create nanoholes with dimensions (e.g., 3 nm dia.) much smaller than those produced by conventional reactive ion etching."

Spark plasma sintering is an innovative technique that emerged in recent years for material syntheses and consolidation. In SPS both external pressure and pulsed current are applied simultaneously to enhance the consolidation of a wide range of ceramic, metallic, and composite powders. Local heating occurs primarily at gaps between particles where the applied electric field induces sparks and the formation of a high-energy plasma. As a result the consolidation can be completed within a shorter time, which allows grain growth and ion diffusion to be efficiently controlled and prevented. These unique features makes SPS suitable to fabricate more complex materials such as heterogeneous materials with specifically defined interface structure, nanostructured materials, and composite materials. The SPS system will be used to develop novel materials for energy applications such as thermoelectrics to recover waste heat, high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells to efficiently convert chemical energy directly into electricity, solid-state electrolytes for high-voltage lithium ion batteries, and low temperature polymer-electrolyte fuel cell plates with high corrosion resistance and low electrical contact resistance.<br/><br/>The SPS system will be one of the major facilities for materials fabrication at the University of Texas at Austin. The system will be managed through the Materials Science and Engineering Program and will be accessible to researchers across campus. The SPS technique adds a new capability to explore a much broader range of materials that cannot be made using conventional sintering. Research activities with the SPS technique will be integrated into the graduate curriculum in the Texas Materials Institute. In addition to lectures on the SPS technique, the availability of this new equipment will offer students in the materials science program an excellent hands-on experience with an advanced materials synthesis techniques.

The cluster will be located in the University of New Hampshire Research Computation and Instrumentation (RCI) core facility and operated by its staff. The installation of the cluster will take advantage of the recent modernization and expansion of the RCI machine room, which provides a stable infrastructure and efficient power supply and cooling to minimize the carbon footprint. The cluster replaces an older one, Zaphod, which is now in its eighth year of operation. While Zaphod has enabled numerous studies and some breakthroughs in computational physics, the new cluster will be at least 15 times more powerful and thus enable more leading-edge science.<br/><br/>The cluster will significantly enhance our ability to simulate plasma and fluid systems, benefiting research projects with more than $3.5M in combined yearly expenditures. Progress will not be just incremental, but we have good reason to believe that in many cases our progress will open up new physical regimes. Most of the simulation codes that will be used are already mature, thus the impact of the cluster on scientific productivity will be immediate. Over its lifetime, the computer cluster will enable leading-edge research for at least a dozen faculty, and many more researchers, post-docs, graduate, and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Much of the research to be performed on the cluster is directly related to space weather. Our progress in modeling the solar corona, solar wind, and geospace has an immediate effect on the Nation's ability to forecast and nowcast space weather, and to understand and to mitigate its effects. The National Space Weather Program explicitly calls for the development of such capabilities. One of the projects supported addresses fundamental issues related to climate change, which is also a topic of great societal concern. The cluster will also make an impact on the education of students in all physical disciplines at UNH by giving them access to a state-of-the art computing facility. It will thus help us to attract the most qualified faculty, post-docs, and students, and it will be an extremely valuable resource for educating the next generation of computational scientists."

Geospace is mostly populated by plasma that originates either in the atmosphere or in the solar wind. Interaction of the these two major players - magnetic fields and charged particles - takes various forms and produces many interesting electromagnetic phenomena such as aurorae (Northern and Southern lights), plasma waves, natural electromagnetic radiation and currents, etc., especially in the polar areas where this interaction is most intense and reaches close to the Earth. Studying these phenomena is important since they affect satellite instrumentation and communication, as well as important technologies such as GPS (Global Positioning System). <br/><br/>A research effort previously funded by NSF and performed in Antarctica within the last few years made new discoveries related to natural electromagnetic phenomena in the polar areas. These discoveries are: (1) correlations between powerful auroral kilometric radiation observed at ~200,000 km above the Earth and analogous signals observed simultaneously at the South Pole Station; (2) discovery of radiation at a high harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency (an important frequency at which charged particles oscillate in a magnetic field); and (3) discovery of a new type of radio emission of auroral origin. These phenomena are best observed, and in most cases can only be observed, using instruments deployed in Antarctica where a manmade electromagnetic interference is minimal.<br/><br/>The new research built on these discoveries will significantly advance our knowledge of the Earth's natural electromagnetic environment, which in turn has significant impact on the broader Geospace environment and space weather because of how interconnected these systems are. Furthermore, the new discoveries probed by this research represent outstanding questions of Geospace research that have escaped scientists' attention so far. The research is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of the Geospace domain and provide students at Dartmouth College with an opportunity to obtain good skills and experience with experimental measurements and data analysis."

When gas is compressed, its temperature increases. However, the increase in temperature might be less if there are other degrees of freedom that absorb the energy. Suppose, for example, that the gas energy resides mainly in whirling eddies, rather than in completely random motion. We ask the question whether there are conditions under which compression of the gas might increase this eddy energy. The significance of this question is that energy in eddies acts differently than random energy because neighboring molecules tend to move in the same direction. That means that there would be fewer times that gas molecules would make high-impact head-on collisions. Important processes such as nuclear fusion depend on this relative motion, so the fusion reactions would be fewer in gases where the energy resides in whirling eddies rather than in random thermal motion. If this were true, then one might also speculate that the effect could be used advantageously in controlling nuclear fusion in a highly compressed plasma. <br/><br/>This project investigates the possibility of storing and then suddenly releasing the energy that can be deposited into turbulent fluid eddies in a plasma. It is conjectured that, under compression on a time scale in which viscosity may be neglected, the energy in such eddies might increase. Also, if the energy resides in hydrodynamic eddies rather than ion temperature, it means that it is unavailable to electrons through collisions. Thus, this energy cannot be easily captured by electrons and radiated. If the compression increases eddy energy more than the random energy, a new paradigm for storing energy in a highly compressed plasma might be advanced in which the energy content is increased under compression in a non-radiating plasma, and then suddenly released under viscous dissipation. To test these speculations, particle-in-cell simulations will be performed to describe compressing turbulent eddies, with guidance obtained from Z-pinch experiments that already appear to exhibit certain features of a turbulent inviscid plasma. This work will involve a collaboration between Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and will be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of Understanding on Research Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation.

Storm and substorm perturbations of the Earth's main magnetic field are among the main indicators of space weather disturbances, and they also help assess other effects such as particle precipitation and plasma heating. A dramatic increase in the amount of data for the terrestrial magnetosphere has made possible a new generation of empirical geomagnetic field models with much larger numbers of degrees of freedom and sophisticated data-binning techniques. A set of the corresponding data-binning, data-fitting and visualization procedures known as the TS07D model is available and widely used in magnetospheric applications. In the project the TS07D model will be improved in three critical aspects. First, the data-binning process will be optimized to achieve a balance between the number of system-level parameters, such as the solar wind electric field, and their forecasting accuracy. As a part of this task the data-binning method will be tested as a pattern-recognition tool, which helps reveal new classes of magnetic storms such as the storms that include saw tooth events. Second, the model output in the form of the effective hot plasma pressure inferred by assuming static force balance for an isotropic plasma will be investigated. The inferred pressure can be used in global MHD models to improve the plasma equation of state and to describe the ring current buildup and decay. It can also be used for the improvement of external boundary conditions in kinetic ring current models, as well as for direct comparison with global plasma patterns retrieved from the energetic neutral atom imaging of the inner magnetosphere. Third, a modification of the field-aligned current part of the model will be studied to transform it into a flexible set of current modules whose foot-point distributions are consistent with low-altitude observations. The model will also be rewritten as a single-language code assuming different platforms and multi-thread operations on computer clusters. <br/><br/>The results of this investigation will be an improved magnetospheric magnetic field model. While direct research with the model described above will be valuable, the model will have an even greater value. Magnetospheric magnetic field models are widely used in other applications in magnetospheric physics by other researchers. Since phenomena occurring in different parts of the magnetosphere and the ionosphere are coupled by the magnetic field the model can be used to map phenomena between these two regions. The models can be used to determine the trajectories of charged particles. Finally they can be used to give an investigator an estimate of the magnetic fields in regions where they do not have observations."

The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure the energy of particles produced at small scattering angles from collisions of atomic nuclei at high energies, carried out at the Brookhaven National Lab using the PHENIX particle detector. These measurements will help to understand the new state of matter, a plasma of quarks, that is formed from such collisions. In particular, the results of this measurement are expected to probe the initial conditions of quarks and other strongly-interacting particles in the nucleus before the collision. In recent years, we have learned that the initial conditions of the quarks before the collision result in hot-spots within the quark-gluon plasma, and how these hot-spots spread their energy within the plasma provides information on this new state of matter. It is worth noting that this research program is carried out at an undergraduate institution, Muhlenberg College, and is a highlight of the Physics Department. Most of the physics majors have participated in it by the time of their graduation. Furthermore, almost all of the participants have chosen to continue in STEM fields after graduation.<br/><br/>Theorists have suggested that measurements of transverse energy are a barometer of a state of saturated plasma. Both studies of existing data from a relativistic heavy ion collisions (RHIC) experiment, called the beam energy scan, by the PHENIX Collaboration and work on transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions are testing gluon-saturation models in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. To date, transverse energy in the forward and backward kinematic regions has not been reported. Associated with regions of higher net baryon chemical potential on the phase diagram of nuclear matter, these measurements, along with existing transverse energy measurements at central rapidity for a variety of colliding systems and beam energies, provide new insight into the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma."

More than a million times hotter than the sun, the QGP is a form of matter governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where the individual quarks and gluons localized within nucleons are expected to scatter out over distances and times many times larger than a femtometer (fm). Only in the last ten years has it become possible to create and study this form of matter in the laboratory using the fleetingly short-lived nuclear sized droplets of plasma created in the aftermath of a heavy-ion collision. The very short lifetime (10 fm/c, where c is the speed of light) and small size (10 fm) have made the study of this matter a theoretical and experimental challenge. The modification of hard QCD jets (bundles of strongly interacting particles) as they pass through this exotic form of matter presents the best tool to date to study the various properties of the QGP. The goal of the research supported by this grant is to continue to formulate both a systematic and sophisticated approach to the theoretical study of these modified jets. Considerable effort will be directed towards a deeper understanding of the factorization of the hard jet cascade from the soft rescattering experienced by the patrons in the jet, as they propagate through the QGP. Yet another goal will be to numerically simulate the partonic cascade process within the dense medium to better understand the event-by-event characteristics of such modified showers. A third goal will be a rigorous analysis of the data within the framework of perturbative QCD based jet modification to isolate the transport properties of the plasma and place stringent error bars on the extracted transport coefficients of jets in a QGP.<br/><br/>This research, at the intersection of particle and nuclear physics, will greatly enhance our understanding of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD in the complicated environments of a dynamically expanding quark gluon plasma. It will introduce state of the art numerical tools to simulate such processes. It will lead to the training of graduate students in both the sophisticated analytical approaches used as well as the numerical simulation tools used in such efforts. The project also includes an outreach effort to convey the latest results from such analyses as well as from other new cutting edge fields to the general public."

During major magnetic storms, the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere under interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) southward conditions causes a change in the region 1 field-aligned currents leading to a sudden increase in the dawn-to-dusk polar cap potential. The region 2 field-aligned currents associated with an inner magnetospheric electric field directed in the dusk-to-dawn direction are no longer able to shield the mid- and equatorial latitudes from high-latitude electric fields. This results in a near-instantaneous penetration of an electric field from high latitude to the middle and the equatorial ionosphere. The prompt penetration electric field is eastward during the daytime to dusk sector and westward in the midnight to dawn sector. Thus this penetration electric field leads to a significant re-distribution of plasma throughout the plasmasphere and ionosphere by enhancing the layer height, and thereby the plasma density, during daylight hours and increasing the decay rates of ionization in darkness. The recent extension of several NSF-funded instrument arrays at American longitudes and assimilation models have made this collaborative research possible for the first time. The large scale plasma density behavior is best tracked by following the GPS measured total electron content (TEC) from equatorial regions using a newly-formed array through the Caribbean and into the continental US to determine the low latitude contribution to mid-latitude enhancements known as storm enhanced density (SED). A variety of data-assimilation models are now available to model the generation of the SED and test the extent of the equatorial contribution to this mid-latitude feature, thereby developing a climatology of such coupled phenomena. This collaborative research will be the first attempt to determine the contribution of the low latitude TEC on mid-latitudes at American longitudes to understand the source of ionization in the SED, to determine the 2D structure and velocity of hundreds of km scales to decameters and to determine the impact of TEC gradients and phase scintillations on space-based navigation systems. This research is also important for better implementation of the Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which supports civilian and commercial aviation."

Experimental and modeling studies have convincingly demonstrated the presence of heavy ions of ionospheric origin in various magnetospheric regions, and that these heavy ions appreciably affect response of the ITM system to solar wind forcing. The ionospheric source and its dynamics play a substantial role in modulating this ion outflow process. This research will directly address several gaps in the current ability to observe the composition of the high-latitude ionospheric plasma and our understanding of the temporally dynamic nature of heating events and associated transients governing composition, ionospheric upflows, and the generation of mesoscale and small-scale ionospheric plasma density structures. Specific science objectives will be to provide detailed data-model analyses to determine the: (1) Location and intensity of storm-time ionospheric sources for molecular ion outflow (2) Contributions of molecular ion recombination, current closure depletion, and ion upflows to plasma loss in realistic auroral current systems (3) Time scales on which major ionospheric loss and transport processes operate, including the effects of electromagnetic induction in highly dynamic situations (4) Effects of three-dimensional current system geometries on ionospheric transport and loss, and the role of these processes in the development of smaller-scale irregularities (5) Temporal dependence of low altitude upflow, including transients in upflow initiation and finite propagation times to higher altitudes, and possible influence of some types of wave-particle interactions on upflow.

These events are believed to be generated by deep convective processes within thunderstorm systems that launch gravity wave structures into the upper atmosphere region of 60 to 100 km where strong viscous dissipation of these wave packets occurs. Part of the wave energy of these primary waves is transformed into the production of secondary waves that are able to propagate higher into the region of atmospheric heights above 200 km. Here, the interaction of these waves with the ionospheric plasma (pushing or pulling plasma along magnetic field lines) would then generate structures called Traveling Ionosphere Disturbances (TIDs) that are so often seen in TEC data. The primary objective of the research is to compare the observed concentric TEC perturbations with those calculated from realistic modeling of the primary and secondary GWs from deep convection in order to strengthen and validate the models for the calculation of these TID structures. A secondary objective would be to utilize the amplitudes and scales of the observed secondary GWs to probe the dynamics of the 'dark' (but highly variable) region near 125-225 km where most of the primary GWs dissipate. A satisfactory explanation of these TID events in terms of gravity wave processes by reference to the successful modeling of the formation of these structures has never been achieved. Thus, the funded research has a significant potential for providing an enhanced understanding of the properties of these circular TID events that relate to the heating and cooling processes associated with the dissipation and transformation of the primary wave structure into the secondary wave output.<br/><br/>Significant societal impact and transformative research outcomes for this award are expected to be achieved as a result of the success in modeling these circular TID events. Because GWs cause scintillation and plasma bubbles that can disrupt satellite communication and GPS signals, this study may lead to better predictions for the occurrence of these phenomena, which is nationally relevant. In order to enhance scientific understanding for the general public, the researcher will disseminate broadly the results via a web site, conference talks, and journal publications.

The new High Frequency (HF) heating facility with the ISR (Incoherent Scatter Radar) and other instruments provides a unique opportunity to study heating-related aeronomic and plasma physics problems. This includes the rapidly-imaged observation of airglow at 557.7 nm, 630.0 nm and 427.8 nm during ionospheric ""heating"" campaigns to understand the role of HF-heating in generating plasma bubbles, or modulating them if already present, and to understand the role of secondary suprathermal electrons in producing airglow at different wavelengths. This research will also yield insight to the heating process, including locating ionospheric ""hot-spots"", yielding details of the electron collision process, elucidating the role of Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves in the strongly heated regions, and study of heating effects in Sporadic E. The latter study will include Ca+ metal-lidar observations as further defined by 555.7 nm imaging as well as ISR and HF radar results. HF heating of the ionosphere offers a unique opportunity to investigate the plasma heating process and its effects on the neutrals in a controlled (experimental) fashion. Outside of the heating campaigns, a database of 630 nm all-sky camera images from other locations will be assembled collaboratively to investigate the global context of the omnipresent ~1 hr period ionospheric waves, and associated dynamics, first identified with the AO ISR. This work will utilize other AO instruments, including the resonance and Rayleigh lidars, to investigate the role of wave coupling from lower atmospheric regions. Also, a proposed new CCD camera will allow high speed imaging to better understand HF heating effects and linking optical and radar meteors to study meteoroid aeronomy. The response of the SAIR to sudden changes in the environment caused by heating will be explored with the collaborative use of multiple instruments, thus informing numerous geophysical research areas. The multidisciplinary nature of this work will help to establish collaborations with plasma physicists, modelers, and space weather scientists. It will also advance the AO cluster capabilities with the addition of a User-Owned, Public Access (UOPA) high frame rate CCD to the current imager and help in establishing international collaborations. Students representing minorities from local universities in Puerto Rico will be encouraged to participate in observations and data analysis. They will be involved in the improvements of the optical systems including training on AO instrumentation and the application of these instruments to study aeronomy of the SAIR."

This project investigates the fundamental chemical processes occurring during direct-in-liquid plasma-assisted reforming of liquid hydrocarbons and alcohols. The experimental work uses radical scavenging techniques, plasma spectroscopy, as well as deuterated and isotopically labeled solvents to elucidate chemical pathways responsible for the formation of hydrogen, short-chained hydrocarbons, and syngas during direct reforming of liquid fuels with and without water or air. The theoretical effort focuses on the development of kinetic models for electrical discharges in ethanol and in iso-octane with the purpose of comparing theoretical (i.e. predicted) and experimental byproducts. The work also extends to the characterization of the discharge using fast optical imaging, schlieren and shadowgraphic imaging, and interferometry.

Some of the most dramatic and technologically harmful aspects of this space weather occur in the ionosphere from mid-latitudes to the polar cap. The HF radar technique as implemented in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has demonstrated its value for making always-on, global-scale observations of ionospheric space weather and for advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical processes. The participants in the international SuperDARN collaboration jointly operate networks in both the northern and southern hemispheres that now total 35 radars. Over the past five years the scope of SuperDARN has greatly increased with the NSF-sponsored construction of a mid-latitude chain of radars that spans the United States. The collaboration on this award counts Virginia Tech as the lead-PI institution and Dartmouth College, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as collaborating PI institutions. Significant benefits are expected from combining efforts and sharing expertise within this consortium that brings together, for the first time, all the NSF-funded SuperDARN groups within one organizational structure. The award will ensure the continued operation of the 11 radars in North America that this group collectively is responsible for. The US SuperDARN group also provides leadership of the international SuperDARN collaboration. The radar measurements of the rapidly expanding SuperDARN network constitute a unique dataset that will support many important science investigations within a wide range of Geospace research areas. In addition, the project will support the education and training of students and postdocs at all of the participating institutions as well as many others in a broad variety of scientific, engineering, and team-building aspects of space science. <br/><br/>SuperDARN utilizes coherent backscatter techniques to track the ExB drift of ionospheric plasma, and in its standard mode of operation, each radar measures the line-of-sight plasma velocity at 75 ranges along each of 16 beam directions covering an area of about 3500 km in range and about 56 degrees in azimuth. The radars operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and deliver images of the high-latitude convection pattern with a two-minute time resolution. The network of SuperDARN radars constitutes a unique global-scale instrument to observe and understand the system-level effects of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and to study space weather in the ionosphere. By providing direct measurements of convection velocities over large regions, SuperDARN provides the best means available to determine ionospheric convection patterns. Through this award operations of the system will be secured for the next five years, including both routine maintenance as well as some necessary technical upgrades. The measurements will be provided together with advanced and improved analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on a broad range of science questions at the forefront of ionospheric research. Planned topics of investigations include: magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, improved models of storm-time ionospheric plasma convection, ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, magnetic conjugacy studies, and ionospheric plasma instabilities and irregularities."

Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on technological assets that can be directly damaged by these, so-called, Space Weather events. Consequently, predicting the occurrence of such events is of critical importance to minimizing their damage. Also, little is known on how the cradle of Space Weather, the solar atmosphere, is formed and maintained. For example, the mechanisms that heat the atmosphere of the Sun to multi-million degree temperatures are not known, and how the continuous outward stream of highly ionized plasma known as the solar wind is heated and accelerated is also still an open question. This project is a four-year effort to perform an upgrade to an existing corona instrument installed at the solar observatory at Mauna Loa to increase both the field of view of the solar atmosphere that can be imaged and the range of the spectrum that it can observe. The new measurements will open a new window in the observations of CMEs, allowing for the first time quantitative studies of their thermal structure, dynamics and evolution for the first time. In addition, they will help deliver the continuous, long-term measurements of plasma dynamics, magnetism and thermodynamics of the entire solar atmosphere that are needed to answer fundamental questions about the heating of the atmosphere and the origin of the solar wind. <br/><br/>The project will be carried out in collaboration between the University of Michigan and the High Altitude Observatory (HAO) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, each contributing essential expertise and experience to ensure its successful completion. An important expected outcome of the effort is the creation of an integrated facility that will connect groundbreaking new observations of the solar atmosphere and solar magnetic field with cutting-edge theoretical and diagnostic tools, all of which will be made easily and readily available to the solar and space physics research community. Undergraduate students will be integrated into the project on yearlong research projects, through the University of Michigan?s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at no cost to this project. Likewise, while not funded in this project, plans are included for graduate students at the University of Michigan to use these new data and modeling tools for their dissertations.<br/><br/>The Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP), a visible light coronagraph and filter polarimeter currently deployed at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory which already routinely measures the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters between 1.05 and 1.38 solar radii, will be upgraded to include multiple chromospheric, transition region and coronal lines. Specifically, the Upgraded CoMP (UCoMP) instrument will extend the wavelength coverage and the number of wavelengths observed by CoMP to include visible and near-IR emission lines in the 5000-11000  range. The lines that UCoMP will observe are emitted by the quiescent and active corona in the 0.8-4.0 MK temperature range, as well as by the core of accelerating CMEs between 0.01 MK up to &#8776;0.5 MK. In addition, a new set of dual detectors will enable UCoMP to have nearly twice the FOV and twice the spatial resolution as compared to the existing CoMP capability. <br/>As and integral part of this effort, a joint data distribution and analysis center will be built at HAO and the University of Michigan that will distribute to the space physics community not only the data from UCoMP but also the necessary advanced tools for spectroscopic diagnostics, data analysis, and modeling."

The solar wind is a stream of charged particles, approximately equal numbers of ions and electrons, and magnetic fields blowing outward from the Sun, which varies in intensity with solar activity. The solar wind moves so fast that when it encounters the magnetosphere a shock forms upstream from it. As solar wind plasma passes through the shock it is slowed down and then flows around the magnetosphere in a sheath region, called the magnetosheath. In this region the magnetic field is erratic or turbulent and evidence suggests that magnetosheath ions are heated as this turbulence is dissipated. The topic is compelling because the potential importance of turbulence and associated ion heating has only recently been recognized. Ions in the magnetosheath eventually cross the magnetopause to provide the dominant source of magnetospheric plasmas, thus changes in their temperature and other properties can have a profound effect on the stability of the magnetosphere itself, which can lead to explosive releases of energy during geomagnetic storms and substorms. The methodology for this study is creative and an important advance over previous studies because it is the first self-consistent comprehensive treatment of this turbulence and its dissipation. As such, the potential for new discoveries is high. Advances in understanding will have benefit to society because, in the longer term, they will contribute to the development of an improved predictive capability that can be used to minimize the impacts of such events. This research contributes to the development of a scientific workforce by training a postdoctoral student and a graduate student. Research results will be disseminated through publications, conferences, and community outreach.<br/><br/>In order to fulfill its objectives, this study investigate how Alfvenic turbulence heats magnetosheath ions, how the heating process saturates, the rate at which energy is transferred to the ions, how electromagnetic energy is transported to support the heating process, how secondary wave emissions develop during the heating, and how the heating process influences the bulk characteristics of the magnetosheath plasma. The primary tool is a 3D hybrid particle in cell model. The proposal uses wave/ion heating events observed by the THEMIS satellites to both specify initial conditions and to validate simulation results. An innovative aspect is the coupled treatment of both the cascade processes associated with plasma turbulence and the additional instabilities that arise from the anisotropies that develop in the ion distributions."

Crop losses due to pathogen infection are substantial and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling plant defense responses are necessary in order to design novel, environmentally friendly disease control strategies. Plants use their innate immune system, which is triggered by two types of signals, to resist infection by diverse pathogens. The first is a general response that allows plants to sense pathogen-derived components commonly referred to as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). The second is called effector-triggered immunity, which represents another level of protection against resistant pathogens that are able to suppress PAMP-induced defenses. The two immune responses have overlapping and distinct nodes. The objective of this project is to define differentially expressed plasma membrane proteins using innovative methods to elucidate the signaling perception and transduction components specific to each immune response. Some of the earliest plant immune responses emanate from the plasma membrane. The unique aspect of this study is that it addresses the very early responses in the plant defense mechanism, an area that is not very well characterized, but key to understanding the dynamics of plant innate immunity and to developing alternative strategies to prevent or control plant disease.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will contribute to science education at multiple levels. The project will result in the training of high-school students and science educators within the public school system as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. One high school teacher and two high school students from Davis, California will be mentored each summer. The students and teacher will be involved in screening Arabidopsis mutant lines for disease phenotypes. A laboratory module will be developed to teach genotyping and polymerase chain reaction methodologies using the plant material screened each summer. This module will be used to educate a large number of Davis high school students as part of their biology curriculum. Taken together, the teaching and outreach components of this proposal will broadly enhance scientific understanding and career development of a diverse student body."

The investigators will analyze observations of ionospheric disturbances through the current period of solar cycle maximum with the aim of deriving a comprehensive, observationally based model of SAPS. The study will examine the onset, spread, and decay of SAPS flows and chart the accompanying changes observed in total electron content (TEC). Coordinated experiments will be conducted with the recently refurbished Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) at Millstone Hill in order to relate the SAPS electric field dynamics to changes in ionospheric density and chemistry and to gauge their effects on the neutral atmosphere. The SAPS phenomenon is associated with strong poleward-directed electric fields (>50 mV/m) and a deep depression, or trough, in ionospheric densities. SAPS is believed to be a consequence of a feedback process whereby magnetic field-aligned current of magnetospheric origin closes across the ionospheric trough, eliciting chemical changes that further reduce the ionospheric density while increasing the electric field in a manner that maintains current continuity. The SAPS phenomenon has important consequences for structuring ionospheric plasma, ionospheric composition, formation of plasma irregularities, and coupling to the neutral atmosphere. The attainment of a comprehensive, observationally-based understanding of SAPS and its impacts on the thermosphere would be a major advance. SAPS has traditionally been studied with single radars and satellites, leading to characterizations that are limited in their utility for understanding the evolution and impacts of SAPS as a multi-dimensional, global-scale phenomenon. Recent advances in observational techniques have fundamentally altered the research landscape.

The investigators will analyze observations of ionospheric disturbances through the current period of solar cycle maximum with the aim of deriving a comprehensive, observationally based model of SAPS. The study will examine the onset, spread, and decay of SAPS flows and chart the accompanying changes observed in total electron content (TEC). Coordinated experiments will be conducted with the recently refurbished Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) at Millstone Hill in order to relate the SAPS electric field dynamics to changes in ionospheric density and chemistry and to gauge their effects on the neutral atmosphere. The SAPS phenomenon is associated with strong poleward-directed electric fields (>50 mV/m) and a deep depression, or trough, in ionospheric densities. SAPS is believed to be a consequence of a feedback process whereby magnetic field-aligned current of magnetospheric origin closes across the ionospheric trough, eliciting chemical changes that further reduce the ionospheric density while increasing the electric field in a manner that maintains current continuity. The SAPS phenomenon has important consequences for structuring ionospheric plasma, ionospheric composition, formation of plasma irregularities, and coupling to the neutral atmosphere. The attainment of a comprehensive, observationally-based understanding of SAPS and its impacts on the thermosphere would be a major advance. SAPS has traditionally been studied with single radars and satellites, leading to characterizations that are limited in their utility for understanding the evolution and impacts of SAPS as a multi-dimensional, global-scale phenomenon. Recent advances in observational techniques have fundamentally altered the research landscape. The construction of a mid-latitude chain of SuperDARN radars in North America has made possible simultaneous (~1 min) views of SAPS plasma flows and electric fields across many hours of MLT while the expansion of the network of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers has made possible continental-scale mapping of TEC on similar time scales.

Communication among cells is critical for most, if not all, living systems and regulates processes including cell migration, cell division, growth, and death. One way this occurs is though a process called endocytosis whereby molecules are transported into the cell. Endocytosis requires an intricate coordination of proteins inside the cell as well as physical changes to the surface of the cell. The deformation of the cell's surface is central to endocytosis, yet there are few tools that can dissect these physical changes that are necessary for endocytosis. One reason this is difficult to study is that this processes is dynamic and occurs on the nanoscale, beyond the resolution of traditional microscopy. This project will advance the study of nanometer scale cell surface dynamics by developing and applying new methods to measure and manipulate the process of endocytosis in living cells. Many biological processes occur on this scale, and the methods developed in this research will be widely applicable across a range of biological systems including virus entry and budding, cell migration, and neurobiology. In addition to contributing to understanding cellular processes, the effort will include training students from K-12 through graduate school on microscopy and the value of multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding cellular processes. <br/>The goal of this research is to understand the dynamics of endocytic vesicle assembly and the interconnected roles played by the proteins involved, as well as the physical changes to plasma membrane shape. A recently developed fluorescence microscopy technique is uniquely suited to imaging nanometer dynamics of vesicle formation in real-time in living cells. In Aim 1 the novel microscopy technique is used to measure endocytic pit formation dynamics upon stimulation with EGF. This experimental platform will then be used to dissect the protein dynamics during pit formation, mapping the correlation between protein dynamics and plasma membrane morphology (Aim 2). Finally, a strategy will be developed to physically stall endocytosis utilizing a tethered ligand. This platform will be used to explore curvature sensing and curvature inducing proteins (Aim 3). This research will yield a quantitative description of ligand internalization dynamics and the interplay between protein recruitment and membrane morphology on a millisecond time scale. Completion of this research will shed light on previously undiscovered mechanisms of plasma membrane dynamics and signaling that may revolutionize the way cellular communication is understood. Further, it will provide new tools to broadly improve the understanding of plasma membrane dynamics in cell signaling and homeostasis. In addition to providing K-12 though graduate students with a rich educational experience, the PI will make available to the community any software that is produced and which is useful to others in achieving high resolution data.<br/>This award is supported jointly by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics"

Multiple new lines of scientific inquiry will be pursued at Cornell and Jicamarca expressly under this award. The broad goal is to quantify chemistry, transport, energetics, and dynamics in the equatorial ionosphere with radar and optical observations and compare the results with prevailing and emerging theories and models. There are ten topics that will form the core of the research to be pursued: (1) the structure and dynamics of the topside ionosphere in the equatorial region, (2) energy and chemical transport at high altitudes, (3) improvement in our understanding of incoherent radar scatter theory, (4) the dynamics and forecasting of equatorial spread-F plasma structures, (5) understanding the phenomenon of stimulated Brillouin scattering, (6) radar imaging of structures in the equatorial thermosphere and ionosphere, (7) understanding the anomalous radar echoes that come from the upper E region and lower F region of the ionosphere (the so called ""150 km echoes""), (8) the dependency of upper atmospheric winds as a function of magnetic local time (MLT winds), (9) observations of radar echoes from meteors and in particular from the head of the meteor as opposed to the ion trail generated by the meteor, (10) understanding radar echoes at ultra-high frequencies (UHF echoes).<br/><br/>The study of the equatorial ionosphere aims to better understand the effects it has on systems on which our technological society increasingly depends. The effects include the disruption of satellite-based communication and navigation systems like GPS, interference with terrestrial HF communication and over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems, and the production of artifacts in synthetic aperture (SAR) and other kinds of radar imagery. Meteoroids of the size observed at Jicamarca could also pose a threat to space vehicles and habitats. Equatorial spread F (ESF) releases energy bound up in the ionospheric configuration near the equator. The ionospheric configuration becomes unstably stratified at twilight. The release of energy involves plasma dynamics occurring over scale sizes ranging from centimeters to hundreds of kilometers, producing rapid flows and deep plasma depletions; these plasma irregularities function as a diffraction screen for radio signals passing through it. <br/><br/>Jicamarca's mission also complements the primary mission of Cornell University, which is education. Cornell and other undergraduate, graduate, and professional students benefit from research at the observatory through direct participation in advanced research projects as well as through additions to the engineering curriculum. Societal impact comes largely through education and career development in the strategic area of radar remote sensing and also through technological and mathematical contributions to other disciplines in aeronomy, space physics, radio science, and astronomy. The opportunity for scientists and students in the U.S. to interact with scientists and students in Peru helps create important international collaborations."

The HF radar technique as implemented in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has demonstrated its value for making always-on, global-scale observations of ionospheric space weather and for advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical processes. The participants in the international SuperDARN collaboration jointly operate networks in both the northern and southern hemispheres that now total 35 radars. Over the past five years the scope of SuperDARN has greatly increased with the NSF-sponsored construction of a mid-latitude chain of radars that spans the United States. The collaboration on this award counts Virginia Tech as the lead-PI institution and Dartmouth College, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as collaborating PI institutions. Significant benefits are expected from combining efforts and sharing expertise within this consortium that brings together, for the first time, all the NSF-funded SuperDARN groups within one organizational structure. The award will ensure the continued operation of the 11 radars in North America that this group collectively is responsible for. The US SuperDARN group also provides leadership of the international SuperDARN collaboration. The radar measurements of the rapidly expanding SuperDARN network constitute a unique dataset that will support many important science investigations within a wide range of Geospace research areas. In addition, the project will support the education and training of students and postdocs at all of the participating institutions as well as many others in a broad variety of scientific, engineering, and team-building aspects of space science. <br/><br/>SuperDARN utilizes coherent backscatter techniques to track the ExB drift of ionospheric plasma, and in its standard mode of operation, each radar measures the line-of-sight plasma velocity at 75 ranges along each of 16 beam directions covering an area of about 3500 km in range and about 56 degrees in azimuth. The radars operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and deliver images of the high-latitude convection pattern with a two-minute time resolution. The network of SuperDARN radars constitutes a unique global-scale instrument to observe and understand the system-level effects of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and to study space weather in the ionosphere. By providing direct measurements of convection velocities over large regions, SuperDARN provides the best means available to determine ionospheric convection patterns. Through this award operations of the system will be secured for the next five years, including both routine maintenance as well as some necessary technical upgrades. The measurements will be provided together with advanced and improved analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on a broad range of science questions at the forefront of ionospheric research. Planned topics of investigations include: magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, improved models of storm-time ionospheric plasma convection, ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, magnetic conjugacy studies, and ionospheric plasma instabilities and irregularities."

The solar wind is a stream of charged particles and magnetic fields blowing outward from the Sun, which varies in intensity with solar activity. Because of its interaction with the solar wind, the magnetosphere is compressed on the dayside and extended in a long ""magnetotail"" on the nightside. The stretched magnetotail field lines store energy extracted from the solar wind. This energy is released by a process called magnetic reconnection, the subject of the present study, during which magnetic energy is converted into plasma flows as well as heating and energization of plasmas within the Earth's magnetosphere. Magnetic reconnection occurs at two locations: one in the near-tail at a distance of 15-30 Earth radii and the other in the distant tail at 100-200 Earth radii. The near-Earth reconnection is explosive, creating high-energy charged particles that are responsible for the dynamic auroras in the upper atmosphere but also for damage to Earth-orbiting satellites. Near-Earth reconnection is largely associated with space weather events called magnetic storms and substorms. In contrast, the distant tail reconnection (about which much less is known) is envisioned to be steadier. It is not understood how the two reconnection sites interact. Of major importance for the present study, fast plasma flows are produced moving both Earthward and tailward from each of these reconnection sites. A satellite at lunar orbit (~60 Earth radii) between the two sites has the important advantage of being able to detect tailward flows from the near-Earth site, and earthward flows from the distant tail site. Thus the connection between the two, and the impact on magnetotail conditions of each, can be investigated from the same mid-tail vantage point. New insights into magnetic reconnection from the suggested study are valuable for research in planetary magnetospheres, as well as astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. The suggested work will provide important training for graduate students. It also includes public outreach and educational activities.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goals described above, the proposers will analyze observations from the Artemus (Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun) satellites in lunar orbit at ~60 Earth radii using case and statistical studies to investigate the occurrence rates of reconnection outflows from both near- and distant-tail reconnection sites, their variations over a range of space weather conditions (quiescent to magnetic storming), the timing between them (i.e., which site activates first), as well as consequences to the mid-tail space environment, such as transient electric field enhancements, changes in the magnetic field geometry, and enhancements in high-energy particle fluxes."

For such fluctuations, velocity-space processes are essential for understanding the physics of the solar wind plasma. The project team will use both hybrid and particle-in-cell simulation techniques to pursue theoretical and computational aspects of the research. The proposed observational studies will utilize data from several different spacecraft flying in the near-Earth's space, and these data will be closely related to the diagnostics of the numerical simulations."

In addition, the role of coupling to the ionosphere will be examined. A well-documented and successfully validated MHD model will be run on state-of-the-art NASA and NSF XSEDE supercomputer systems to perform a well planned set of high resolution idealized simulation runs as well as case studies driven by solar wind observations for real events.

During major magnetic storms, the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere under interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) southward conditions causes a change in the region 1 field-aligned currents leading to a sudden increase in the dawn-to-dusk polar cap potential. The region 2 field-aligned currents associated with an inner magnetospheric electric field directed in the dusk-to-dawn direction are no longer able to shield the mid- and equatorial latitudes from high-latitude electric fields. This results in a near-instantaneous penetration of an electric field from high latitude to the middle and the equatorial ionosphere. The prompt penetration electric field is eastward during the daytime to dusk sector and westward in the midnight to dawn sector. Thus this penetration electric field leads to a significant re-distribution of plasma throughout the plasmasphere and ionosphere by enhancing the layer height, and thereby the plasma density, during daylight hours and increasing the decay rates of ionization in darkness. The recent extension of several NSF-funded instrument arrays at American longitudes and assimilation models have made this collaborative research possible for the first time. The large scale plasma density behavior is best tracked by following the GPS measured total electron content (TEC) from equatorial regions using a newly-formed array through the Caribbean and into the continental US to determine the low latitude contribution to mid-latitude enhancements known as storm enhanced density (SED). A variety of data-assimilation models are now available to model the generation of the SED and test the extent of the equatorial contribution to this mid-latitude feature, thereby developing a climatology of such coupled phenomena. This collaborative research will be the first attempt to determine the contribution of the low latitude TEC on mid-latitudes at American longitudes to understand the source of ionization in the SED, to determine the 2D structure and velocity of hundreds of km scales to decameters and to determine the impact of TEC gradients and phase scintillations on space-based navigation systems. This research is also important for better implementation of the Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which supports civilian and commercial aviation."

This project investigates the fundamental chemical processes occurring during direct-in-liquid plasma-assisted reforming of liquid hydrocarbons and alcohols. The experimental work uses radical scavenging techniques, plasma spectroscopy, as well as deuterated and isotopically labeled solvents to elucidate chemical pathways responsible for the formation of hydrogen, short-chained hydrocarbons, and syngas during direct reforming of liquid fuels with and without water or air. The theoretical effort focuses on the development of kinetic models for electrical discharges in ethanol and in iso-octane with the purpose of comparing theoretical (i.e. predicted) and experimental byproducts. The work also extends to the characterization of the discharge using fast optical imaging, schlieren and shadowgraphic imaging, and interferometry.

This project will study the homogeneous nucleation of carbon nanomaterials in a novel microplasma process. Microplasmas are non-equilibrium, atmospheric-pressure plasmas formed in confined electrode geometries that allow particles to be nucleated and rapidly quenched to limit their final size and agglomeration. Preliminary results have shown that nanodiamond, carbon clusters less than 5 nm in size exhibiting diamond phase, can be produced at near ambient conditions, far from the thermodynamic stability of diamond, by dissociation of ethanol vapor in a microplasma. This project will extend these experiments to the formation of other carbon allotropes including fullerene and graphene. Dissociation of carbon precursors in the microplasma with varying C:H:O ratios will be characterized by optical emission spectroscopy to relate radical species such as carbon dimers and atomic hydrogen to particle nucleation. Particle nucleation will be monitored in real time by aerosol mobility measurements. The as-grown carbon nanomaterials will be collected and further characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, micro Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A particularly important aspect of the work will be to explore the influence of quenching rate on particle formation by pulsing the microplasma at different frequencies.<br/><br/>This project will provide new insight into the formation of carbon nanomaterials. By linking plasma chemistry to material structure, an empirical model for homogeneous nucleation analogous to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films will be developed. Size-structure relationships such as the stability of nanodiamond will be established by varying the residence time and quench rate in the microplasma. Ultimately, the research will enable the structure of carbon nanomaterials to be controlled at nucleation so that it is possible to tune their properties for various applications. The research activities will provide educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, and be a part of an elective course on nanotechnology at a local high school."

On August 21, 2017, a rare total solar eclipse event will occur that will traverse the continental United States, starting in Oregon and ending in South Carolina. The previous such occasion was on 29 July 1878. The purpose of this major research instrumentation project is to design, build, test, and fly a highly advanced imaging spectrometer to make measurements during this eclipse, for the first time, of the solar corona in the infrared spectrum. This opens a new wavelength window for observation of the solar corona that has exiting potential for advancing our understanding of this hard-to-observe region. The Airborne Infra-Red Spectrometer (AIR-Spec) instrument will include a novel image stabilization system to allow it to be deployed on NSF's Gulfstream V aircraft operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Flying at an altitude above 49,000 feet makes it possible to get measurements without disturbances from local weather and avoiding most of the absorbing water vapor in the atmosphere that poses a challenge for observations at the ground. The completion of this program will see the delivery to NCAR of a stable commissioned instrument that is certified and available for other scientist to fly on the GV for future research missions. The GV can travel almost anywhere and re-flights at other future eclipses are an obvious possibility to pursue. The July 2, 2019, South Pacific eclipse will be the first chance for another eclipse flight. In addition, the stabilized high resolution observing capability can be used by other experiments for solar and atmospheric observations throughout the world.<br/><br/>The project will be carried out in collaboration between the scientists and engineers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and NCAR's High Altitude Observatory (HAO), each contributing essential expertise and experience to ensure its successful completion. The project will directly contribute to training the next generation of instrumentation scientists while fostering diversity. A Harvard graduate student from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will be involved in all aspects of the project, including design, fabrication and test of the AIR-Spec instrument, as well as analysis of the observations, if scientific data are acquired during the eclipse. This will form the basis for her thesis and she will enjoy the benefits of mentoring from scientists and engineers at both SAO and HAO. In addition, the 2017 US solar eclipse is expected to generate a huge amount of interest amongst the general public and the project team will work closely with partners at the National Air and Space Museum, the Boston Museum of Science and the Eclipse Mega-Movie group at HAO on pre and post eclipse outreach events. <br/><br/>The AIR-Spec instrumentation includes an image stabilization system, a feed telescope, a grating spectrometer and a slit-jaw imager. It will measure emission line intensity, FWHM, and Doppler shift a set of magnetically sensitive coronal emission lines at a range of coronal positions during the August 21, 2017 ""Great American Eclipse"". Although high resolution, high sensitivity coronal imaging spectroscopy has never been performed between 1.4 and 4um, this spectral region has great potential for coronal plasma diagnostics, for coronal hole spectroscopy, and as a path finder for observations of coronal magnetic fields. Infrared coronal emission lines are well suited for measuring magnetic field properties using the Zeeman and Hanle effects, but such measurements require high precision spectro-polarimetric instruments that cannot be designed until the candidate emission lines have been characterized. The 2017 eclipse provides a unique opportunity to survey these lines, and AIR-Spec observations can help provide guidance for future ground-based Infrared observations. The AIR-Spec commissioning flight during the 2017 eclipse will target three science goals: (1) Search for high frequency waves in multiple lines at multiple locations in the corona. These waves are candidates for heating and acceleration of the solar wind. (2) Identify large-scale flows in the corona, particularly in polar coronal holes. Three of the lines to be observed are expected to be strong in coronal hole plasmas because they are excited in part by scattered photospheric light. Line profile analysis will probe the origins of the fast and slow solar wind. (3) Complement ground based eclipse observations to provide detailed plasma diagnostics throughout the corona. AIR-Spec will measure IR emission of ions also observed in the visible, giving insight into plasma heating and acceleration at radial distances inaccessible with existing or planned spectrometers. On the technology side, the AIR-Spec stabilization system removes a significant obstacle to airborne observations. The system relies on inertial measurements to stabilize the platform to <1.4 arcsec RMS for the planned 0.3 sec exposure (1.7arcsec RMS per sec), allowing it to be used for a wide range of solar and atmospheric imaging experiments. Finally, for the future there is the possibility for AIR-Spec to be modified to add linear polarization optics for direct measurements of coronal magnetic field direction."

In particular, laser-plasma accelerators are leading the way toward self-contained compact accelerators and light sources. This award will investigate a novel way to produce extreme ultraviolet and X-ray free-electron lasers based on laser-plasma accelerators. The advancement will be used to develop practical applications of laser-plasma accelerators in compact and coherent radiation sources. The award will also support the training of graduate students at Stanford University, engaging them in the development of advanced beam and free-electron lasers theory and simulation tools. <br/><br/>Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) have shown the abilities to accelerate electron beams from rest up to a few GeV using high-intensity lasers interacting in centimeter-scale plasmas. Although the beams have relatively low emittance and high peak current with only a few femtosecond pulse duration, the beam energy spread is two orders of magnitude larger than the spread from conventional radio-frequency accelerators. Such a large energy spread can make the FEL interaction in a normal undulator very ineffective. A transverse gradient undulator (TGU) can be used to compensate the effects of beam energy spread if the electron energy is correlated with its transverse position in the TGU. Previous theoretical and numerical studies have shown that such a concept may drastically improve the LPA FEL performance. This award will take the concept to practice by studying beam transport and dynamics from a LPA to and inside a TGU with the desired optics properties, and by developing FEL simulation tools that take into account various effects in a TGU. For verification of results, comparisons will be made, where applicable, to TGU experiments through external collaborations."

During major magnetic storms, the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere under interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) southward conditions causes a change in the region 1 field-aligned currents leading to a sudden increase in the dawn-to-dusk polar cap potential. The region 2 field-aligned currents associated with an inner magnetospheric electric field directed in the dusk-to-dawn direction are no longer able to shield the mid- and equatorial latitudes from high-latitude electric fields. This results in a near-instantaneous penetration of an electric field from high latitude to the middle and the equatorial ionosphere. The prompt penetration electric field is eastward during the daytime to dusk sector and westward in the midnight to dawn sector. Thus this penetration electric field leads to a significant re-distribution of plasma throughout the plasmasphere and ionosphere by enhancing the layer height, and thereby the plasma density, during daylight hours and increasing the decay rates of ionization in darkness. The recent extension of several NSF-funded instrument arrays at American longitudes and assimilation models have made this collaborative research possible for the first time. The large scale plasma density behavior is best tracked by following the GPS measured total electron content (TEC) from equatorial regions using a newly-formed array through the Caribbean and into the continental US to determine the low latitude contribution to mid-latitude enhancements known as storm enhanced density (SED). A variety of data-assimilation models are now available to model the generation of the SED and test the extent of the equatorial contribution to this mid-latitude feature, thereby developing a climatology of such coupled phenomena. This collaborative research will be the first attempt to determine the contribution of the low latitude TEC on mid-latitudes at American longitudes to understand the source of ionization in the SED, to determine the 2D structure and velocity of hundreds of km scales to decameters and to determine the impact of TEC gradients and phase scintillations on space-based navigation systems. This research is also important for better implementation of the Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which supports civilian and commercial aviation."

As Villanova hires its next generation of faculty members, it will be offer access to leading-edge equipment. The emphasis on nanomaterials fabrication and development necessitates the upgrading of their experimental facilities to attract leading researchers and educators who can make an immediate impact as they join this dynamic group. The PI and co-PIs are all dedicated to improving opportunities and access for under-represented minorities in engineering and the sciences and two of the principals on this grant are female STEM faculty members. The five PIs combined are advising 16 graduate students, 7 of whom are women, and are working with 19 undergraduate students, including 5 women. Bryn Mawr College was established in 1885 as the first institution in the US to offer Ph.D. degrees to women and the undergraduate program remains all-female, featuring 1300 women, 26% of whom are majoring in math or science. The Villanova College of Engineering also features one of the highest percentages of female students studying engineering, at almost 1/3 of the engineering school enrollment.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The Villanova Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) facility will serve as a center for collaborative nanomaterials research and development linking five faculty at three Philadelphia-region colleges and universities. The collaborating faculty have been using an existing first generation ALD device at the University of Pennsylvania, but the expansion and growth in externally funded thin film nanomaterials development research activity by the three Villanova faculty has led to difficulties in coordination and timing with the Penn facilities. The Villanova facility will greatly enhance faculty and student access and allow the overall team to greatly expand their collaborative work. The Villanova facility will feature an ALD system with significantly upgraded capabilities. The system will be faster and feature improved batch operation, allowing the scheduling of a greater volume of work, and feature the ability to do both thermal and plasma deposition. The addition of plasma deposition technology features greater precision and control of the deposition process leading to significantly higher film quality. The plasma deposition process features enhanced nucleation and growth of the films, leading to greater homogeneity and film density. The plasma process also enables the deposition of a much wider variety of thin film materials enabling critical new research areas."

In this application, the charge will be stimulated by the passage of charged particles passing through the gas cells and can be sensed electronically. The identity of which cells have been charged provides the spatial information on the particles. Preliminary tests suggest that it will be possible for these devices to detect particles in a billionth of a second and that cells can be made with a size of about one tenth of a millimeter. Using experience from commercial providers of flat screen televisions, it is hoped that these detectors can be larger and cheaper than the types in use in other particle physics instruments today. These detectors may find application in the medical or other communities interested in charged particle tracking. These and other particle physics applications will also be discussed in public dissemination. Basic skills in electronics and fabrication techniques will be passed along to undergraduates from U.

In some cases it will be possible to use incoherent scatter radar data to determine the plasma density structures within the ionosphere that affect the propagation and dispersion of the waves. Statistical analysis of MFB events, in conjunction with conjugate satellite measurements, will be used to determine the nature of electron precipitation associated with the events.

Two types of blue jets (BJ) have been observed. The brief upward jets, which propagate only a few km and terminate below 26 km, were dubbed blue starters (BS), while so-called gigantic blue jets (GBJ) propagate into the mesosphere/lower ionosphere. It is widely accepted that BJ?s are produced by an upward propagating leader from thunderstorms. Some attempts have been made to describe the leader formation, including recent model of bipolar BJ. However, despite substantial progress in the theoretical understanding of this complicated phenomenon, significant puzzles remain. In fact, two outstanding problems are still unresolved and both are relevant to the laboratory leaders, as well as to the leaders formed by lightning. Namely, which mechanism governs the low propagation velocity of the leader, and how a self-consistent electric field in the streamer zone of a leader is formed. This research will focus on quantitative modeling of Blue Jets/Blue Starters/Gigantic Blue Jets. It will combine two major models, the first is an analytical and numerical study of current contraction, which determines transformation of a streamer flash into a leader, and which governs slow propagation velocity of BJ?s. The second is a model of the average electric field formed by a group of streamers in the streamer zone of a leader, which determines the BJ formation. The theoretical study will be complemented by the table top experiments that could be used for validation of the existing models. The ground based and satellite-borne optical and ultraviolet observations will attempt to validate the model predictions. Understanding the physics of BJ/BS/GBJ is not only a frontier scientific topic, but it could provide a mechanism for direct transient coupling between the ionosphere and stratosphere with implication to the global electric circuit. Potential applications include: extending fundamental knowledge in the physics of gas discharge and weakly ionized plasma by applying our model to laboratory experiments of streamer and leader breakdown, and influencing the design of powerful lasers and plasma chemical reactors through a quantitative understanding of current contraction. The program will support the education and training of the University of Maryland students in this multidisciplinary field, combining aspects of theoretical and computational plasma physics as well as gas dynamics. The study will promote collaboration between the academia and industry. It also involves broad international collaboration between Princeton University, the University of Maryland, and leading scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences."

The fundamental issue to be addressed is solar control of irregularity production via indirect IMF effects versus direct effects of solar-induced ionization. This study will focus on evaluating the extent of IMF control of small-scale irregularities and the relationship to other scales. The project will address the question of whether the presence of the polar patches is a necessary condition for irregularity production, and whether solar illumination suppresses or enhances irregularity generation. Inter-hemispheric differences will be investigated to determine the relative importance of solar wind drivers versus solar ionization.<br/><br/>Earlier studies of small-scale plasma irregularities have analyzed local observations using rockets and/or radio techniques. This project will analyze irregularity production in the polar cap in context of its global drivers focusing on observations from the first US Antarctic HF (SuperDARN) radar at McMurdo, Antarctica and complementary instrumentation. The polar cap ionosphere is directly connected to the solar wind; hence, one can expect IMF effects on small-scale irregularity production to be even more pronounced than in the previously studied auroral region. The polar cap also has reasonably uniform solar ionization conditions near solstices and sharp contrasts between seasons, so solar illumination effects can be revealed more clearly. In addition, the polar cap appears to be especially rich in irregularities. <br/><br/>This project will leverage data from the NSF-funded Antarctic facilities, providing essential support for a newly-established faculty researcher in the US, and expand a graduate student training program in the geosciences area in Alaska."

Natural gas, water science, and their symbiosis are keys to sustainability, and novel, economical approaches to the use of natural gas in organic synthesis at moderate temperatures (<200 degC) remains a challenge. The physics and the chemistry of water and methane (i.e., the largest component fraction of natural gas) have relevance in the atmospheric and planetary sciences. Massive quantities of natural gas are entrapped in crystalline water throughout the world, from the deep seabed to beneath the polar ice regions. Natural gas has merit for its use in organic synthesis but the challenges are in the controlled activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of methane at moderate temperatures and their functionalization via carbon-carbon cross-coupling with aryl heteroatoms. This project involves the synergy of the five sciences: <br/><br/>1) CH4 hydrates/plasma, <br/>2) cyclodextrin (CD) catalysis, <br/>3) palladium-catalyzed C-H activation/C-C crosscoupling,<br/>4) microreaction engineering, and <br/>5) multiphase microfluidics with online analytics. <br/><br/>If successful, this research could reduce the cost of current synthetic methodologies of Pd-catalyzed methylations of aryl heteroatoms for fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals by at least an order of magnitude. The resulting scientific discoveries will broadly impact aqueous natural gas technology, but they will also advance chemical engineering education. The project will accomplish two K-12 educational goals beyond affecting the undergraduate and the graduate-level chemical reaction engineering curricula that the PI teaches: 1) inspire science and mathematics students to pursue careers in chemical engineering, and 2) innovate approaches to remotely involve students with chemical engineering research. The PI has already established a partnership with the Alabama School of Fine Arts, Birmingham, AL where he is mentoring a K-12 senior for the second year towards the completion of his research thesis. The knowledge created will be disseminated through works of art in both the science and the visual arts they generate. Students enrolled in the Alabama School of Fine Arts are commonly gifted in the visual arts, and thus each student the PI advises will express the chemical engineering knowledge they learn by touring exhibitions at the Birmingham Art Walk, the Alabama School of Fine Arts, and the posting of artwork photographs on the PI's laboratory website. The outcomes are anticipated to be innovations that discover the science of natural gas in aqueous systems, a K-12 educational component that broadly outreaches beyond the campus boarders, and ultimately the advancement of natural gas utilization in a broad cross-section of society.<br/><br/>Cyclodextrins (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-CD's), both naturally occurring and synthetically prepared organic inclusion compounds, are known to stabilize CH4 in liquid water and to catalyzed CH4 hydrate formation with molecular diffusion often controlling both processes. Molecular-level understanding acquired via the microreaction engineering of inclusion compounds and their complexes in C-H activation/C-C cross-coupling could advance the versatility of natural gas as an economical feedstock for multiphase organic synthesis. The understanding will be learned by i) innovating microsystems with online analytics for continuous multiphase C-C cross-couplings of CH4, ii) discovering the Pd-catalyzed C-C cross-coupling of CH4 stored in hydrates with aryl heteroatoms at organic-liquid water interfaces using alpha-, beta-, and gamma-CD's, iii) discovering the Pd-catalyzed C-C cross-coupling of ionized CH4 with aryl heteroatoms at cold plasma-liquid water interfaces, and iv) elucidating the catalytic cycle(s) that control the C-C cross-couplings. The project couples the PI's decade of experiences studying inorganic inclusion compounds in his doctoral research, innovating science and technology that are enabling the US to secure natural gas in his post-graduate career, researching microchemical systems for organic synthesis in his postdoctoral research, and building his academic laboratory on aqueous methane conversion with discoveries on gas hydrates and hydrophilic organic synthesis."

The ionosphere affects modern technologies such as civilian and military communications and navigation and surveillance systems. Reliable communication and navigation, therefore, often requires correction of the signals for effects imposed by the ionosphere. To do that the properties of the ionosphere, such as its variability with respect to magnetospheric disturbance, time of day, season of the year, and solar cycle variability must be well understood and modeled. The fundamental measurements of IT-SPINS are high-sensitivity line-of-sight observations of Ultra Violet nightglow radiance produced by the recombination of Oxygen ions with electrons in the upper ionosphere. IT-SPINS will rotate at two rotations per minute about the orbit normal and will acquire 60 radiance measurements per revolution. Observations from several rotations will then be combined in a tomographic inversion algorithm to produce two-dimensional altitude/in-track images of the emissions. In this way, IT-SPINS will provide the first-ever set of unambiguous, geographically-extended measurements of the Oxygen ion distributions within the nightside ionosphere. Specifically, IT-SPINS will provide crucial information on the ion gradient structures in the, so-called, Topside Transition Region, from approximately 500km to 1000km altitude, where a transition takes place in the plasma conditions from being dominated by Oxygen ions to being dominated by Hydrogen ions. Prior studies of the TTR have primarily used large incoherent scatter radars at only a few locations around the World. Consequently, a thorough climatological study of the TTR's dependence on latitude, local time, and solar and geomagnetic activity does not exist at present. Lacking fundamental understanding of the variability of the TTR and the detailed morphology of Oxygen ion distributions throughout the TTR is a critical limitation currently in our ability to accurately model and predict ionospheric variability. <br/><br/>Beyond fundamental space weather objectives, the IT-SPINS project places a significant priority on experimental learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education at the university undergraduate level. Undergraduate students will participate in responsible roles on all aspects of the project. This provides the students with rare and valuable opportunities to learn and practice project management; systems engineering; engineering design, development and testing; and flight operations and data analysis skills through first-hand, project-based learning while being mentored by faculty and professional staff. In addition, through affiliation with the statewide Montana Space Grant Consortium (MSGC), the project will engage traditionally disadvantaged students at MSGC affiliated Tribal Colleges with IT-SPINS operational activities during the orbital phase. <br/><br/>IT-SPINS can achieve compelling science results over a wide range of available orbit inclinations (>40 degrees) and altitudes (500-700 km). This altitude range puts us at optimal viewing of the TTR above, and plasma structures below the satellite while ensuring a 25-year de-orbit criteria. The following primary and secondary science objectives and derived science questions are designed so that a subset of them can be addressed by IT-SPINS regardless of the satellite orbit it will be given. The primary science objective for the mission is to study the variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles. The following three questions will be addressed: 1) How does the altitude and thickness of the boundary between O+ dominated ionospheric physics and H+, He+ dominated plasmasphere physics vary as a function of magnetic L-shell, magnetic longitude, local time and geomagnetic activity? 2) How well do Geospace numerical models predict the observed variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles? 3) What is the importance of the charge exchange between O+ and neutral hydrogen to the TTR? Imaging the mesoscale structuring of equatorial plasma bubbles and polar cap patches constitutes a secondary science objective for the mission. The equatorial part of the secondary science objective can be addressed by both mid- and high inclination orbits, whereas the polar patch part can only be addressed for high inclination orbits (~70 degrees or higher)."

Common to these interaction problems are the huge inherent scale separations between the different dynamical components of the flow, which render a direct numerical simulation hopeless and which also introduce a stochastic component to the system dynamics because the small-scale components are only partially observable. Hence the study involves the mathematical investigation of various systems of multidimensional nonlinear PDEs using a combination of asymptotic analysis, stochastic modeling, and numerical computation, all with an eye towards ultimate applications in the real world that are relevant to climate science and nuclear fusion. Specifically, the study consists of three projects. The first considers a special kind of small-scale internal gravity wave in the ocean and its interactions with mean currents near the sea floor, the second considers random particle motion induced by deep-ocean internal waves in the presence of forcing and dissipation, and the third investigates the wave-turbulence jigsaw puzzle posed by interactions between strong drift waves and strong zonal flows in the problem of plasma confinement in tokamaks.<br/><br/>Atmosphere ocean dynamics relevant to climate science contains a vast span of active dynamical scales, from millimeters and milliseconds associated with sound waves to planetary scales and decades associated with large-scale ocean circulations, for example. All these scales are dynamically coupled together through a wide variety of nonlinear interactions and this is where fundamental mathematical theory can make a decisive contribution, namely by reducing these interactions into more tractable and understandable components that can then be simulated with significantly greater ease. Analogous comments apply to plasma dynamics that is relevant to fusion research and the behavior of tokamak devices. Hence, results from this theoretical study may feed into the future design of next generation atmosphere ocean forecasting systems for weather and climate, which is of great societal importance, and they should also strengthen the fundamental principles that feed into the design of nuclear fusion devices in tokamaks."

The ionosphere is an ionized layer in the upper atmosphere (at and above ~110-km altitude) where electrical currents can flow in response to the coupling between the Earth's magnetosphere and solar wind plasma flow in the Earth's neighborhood (geospace). Many geospace phenomena are caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections that have their effects transmitted to ionospheric layers, which are especially strong in the polar regions. The ionospheric plasma convection (that carries ionospheric currents) becomes strong during geomagnetic storms when it moves as a whole over both polar caps from dayside to nightside and then returns to the dayside via respective auroral zones. Polar ionospheres are also electrically connected via the Earth's magnetic field lines in conjugate points. The ionospheric connection plays a very important role in transporting currents and electric fields between the magnetopause and both polar regions, but these processes are still insufficiently studied. <br/><br/>The large network of SuperDARN radars already observe ionospheric convection in the northern and southern polar regions on a regular basis. Data from these radars are used to study responses of ionospheric convection to solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field changes, the relation of central polar cap convection to that of the cusp and midnight regions, and to the state of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The NSF-funded Antarctic SuperDARN radars at McMurdo and South Pole contribute to the studies such as relationships between wave structures observed in the solar wind and respective responses in the polar caps, motion of plasma density structures, ion-neutral coupling, and thermospheric winds. This research effort will continue developing the NSF-funded radars, help addressing fundamental questions of the Geospace research that have not yet thoroughly examined."

Led by the Von Karman Institute (VKI) of Belgium, the QB50 project is predominantly funded from a FP7 Grant by the European Union (EU) and includes international participation from more than 30 countries. The idea behind the project is that the EU grant will supply the science instruments and a joint launch for all 50 satellites, which will be provided by participating teams that will secure their own independent funding for CubSat production and ground station operation. The plan for QB50 is that all 50 CubeSats will be launched together in 2015-2016 on a Shtil-2.1 from Murmansk in northern Russia into a circular orbit at 320 km altitude, inclination 79. Due to atmospheric drag, the orbits will decay and the CubeSats will be able to explore all layers of the lower thermosphere without the need for on-board propulsion, down to 90 or 100 km, depending on the quality of their thermal design. It is expected that the network will spread around the Earth (in a single orbit plane) providing a range of spacing and temporal revisit times. The lifetime of the CubeSats from deployment until atmosphere re-entry will be less than three months. Each QB50 satellite is required to carry one of three standardized sensor packages: a plasma package, a neutral package or a composition package. The plasma package is based on a miniaturized Langmuir probe providing plasma density, the neutral package measures the atomic and molecular Oxygen density, and the composition package is an Ion-Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS).<br/><br/>The partners of the QBUS consortium (3 research universities, one Hispanic minority undergraduate university, and 2 national laboratories) all have significant CubeSat and Ionosphere-Thermosphere (IT) science experience. The QBUS team will build 4 identical 2U CubeSat flight units based on a joint design, with participating members providing various components of the usual satellite functions (attitude determination and control, uplink and downlink telecommunications, power subsystem including a battery and body-mounted solar cells, on-board data handling and storage by a CPU). Of the three available options, the QBUS team has been approved by the QB50 project to fly the INMS sensor built by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL). This instrument will measure atmospheric composition via abundance determination of neutral atomic O, molecular O2 and N2. QBUS as part of QB50 offers a unique opportunity for dense and distributed in-situ measurements of the most poorly characterized state parameter: neutral and ion composition from 100-320 km. The project will use measurements from QBUS, QB50, and complementary ground-based observations to characterize and understand how compositional changes are created by energy inputs, propagated and ultimately equilibrated within the IT system. Specifically, it will be possible, for the first time, to quantify the effect of composition changes (primarily O/N2) on electron density changes across temporal scales (minutes to months) and spatial scales (10-s km to global).<br/><br/>The project constitutes a particularly creative and cost-effective approach. The multi-university and national Laboratory solution proposed entails partners sharing and leading by their specific strengths. Efficiency of numbers and division of labor by experience will result in tremendous program costs savings. In addition, QBUS constitutes substantial leveraging on the international QB50 project. As a result of U.S. funded participation in QB50 the entire U.S. science community will have the opportunity to access the full constellation dataset from QB50. The QB50/QBUS program also serves as impetus for unprecedented coordination between NSF-sponsored facilities and instruments for in-situ and ground based campaigns to enable IT discovery. The project has tremendous educational impacts. It will directly support the training of the next generation of instrument engineers and geoscientists at 4 universities (one of which is minority serving) in the consortium, expecting to provide around 200 students hands-on involvement in the development, testing and operations of the QBUS CubeSats. It will facilitate additional student participation across the United States and internationally through use of derived data products from the entire QB50 mission."

We do this, perhaps unconsciously, because ordered arrangement often saves the most space. Similarly, out of all of the solid forms of matter, physicists perhaps know the most about crystalline materials; the structural order makes them easier to conceptualize and to define mathematically. However, many solid materials can be rigid, yet have no well-defined order. These materials often behave in peculiar ways in response to external stimuli. Consider a pile of sand at the bottom of an hourglass. What seems stable enough can suddenly avalanche upon the addition of a few extra grains. Or even a snarled traffic jam: what determines the boundary between a flowing state and a rigid one? Our world is full of similar examples where systems exist in a region near marginal stability. This project aims to understand the ways in which a jammed, amorphous solid can vibrate and fluctuate. By using ""model"" systems such as colloidal dust suspended in a gaseous plasma, the principal investigator and research team can visualize the individual motion of particles which constitute the near-effortless structural rearrangements in amorphous systems. Not only do the research activities shed light on the individual molecular motions common in amorphous solids such as glasses, but they provide a connection between dynamics and disorder in a broad range of physical systems. In parallel to this research effort, the project includes the creation of an after-school science club at a local elementary school in Dekalb county, which hosts the 3rd largest school system and is the most diverse county in Georgia.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>This project focuses on the nature and origin of mechanical rigidity in amorphous solids, a subject which permeates many areas of condensed matter physics and materials science. Both experiments and simulations are used to investigate the dynamics of low-frequency vibrational modes and the role of geometric confinement in jammed and glassy systems, where small changes in temperature or density result in an enormous increase in the kinetic timescales of motion. The project addresses two major topics, the first of which is the origin of low-frequency vibrational modes in disordered solids. It has been known for 40 years that molecular glasses have excess vibrational modes at low frequencies. An ideal model system to study this phenomena is an under-damped ensemble of colloidal particles suspended in a plasma, commonly known as a ""dusty plasma"". This system is used to directly visualize and characterize the T = 0 vibrational modes in a way not possible in molecular glasses. The second project addresses fluctuation-induced forces in jammed systems. The jamming transition has many similarities to 2nd-order phase transitions, such as a diverging length scale near the critical point. By implementing geometric confinement to control the spectrum of force chains that can exist near jamming, in analogy to critical Casimir forces in thermal systems, the research team can quantify this length. The experiments use soft, slippery, polymer hydrogel particles whose size can be varied with salt concentration as a ""sandbox"" for studying the jamming transition in the absence of particle friction. In parallel to both research efforts, the project includes the creation of an after-school science club at a local elementary school in Dekalb county, which hosts the 3rd largest school system and is the most diverse county in Georgia."

How lightning originates inside thunderclouds and propagates through air is a longstanding fundamental problem in the field of atmospheric electricity. It has been suggested that there are three critical steps in lightning initiation and propagation: initiation and propagation of streamers that are relatively cold plasma channels, transition from streamers to bright, hot, highly conductive leaders, and propagation of leaders. Recent studies have firmly established that streamers can be initiated from thundercloud hydrometeors subject to the maximum thundercloud electric field measured so far. However, the other two steps of lightning initiation and propagation remain poorly understood. It is unknown whether the streamers originating from thundercloud hydrometeors will be able to generate the first leader at their stem, and if they can, how the streamer-to-leader transition occurs and how this transition depends on thundercloud conditions such as thundercloud charge and field. In addition, experiments and observations have indicated that the most common type of lightning leaders called negative leaders develops in a stepping manner. Perhaps being one of the most ""mysterious"" phenomena in atmospheric electricity, luminous blob structures known as ""space stems"" are found to appear in front of the negative leader tip and they develop into bidirectional ""space leaders"" to support the stepping propagation of negative leaders. There is currently no theory that offers an explanation for the formation of space stems and space leaders.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to develop an advanced computer model and code to study lightning initiation and propagation. A three-dimensional computer code, that includes all required plasma kinetic and gas dynamic components to self-consistently model streamer propagation, leader initiation, and formation of space stems and space leaders, will be developed. With the developed model and code, the following research activities will be conducted: (1) investigating the characteristics of long (>10 cm) streamers propagating in electric fields near or greater than the streamer propagation threshold fields, (2) studying the initiation of streamers from the trail of an expanding, accelerating streamer of opposite polarity and its implications for the formation of space stems and space leaders, and (3) investigating air heating in the channels of streamers originating from hydrometeors, the possibility of the formation of the first leader channel at their stem, and the formation of space stems and space leaders in front of a negative leader.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>Intellectual merit of these activities is defined by the direct attack on one of the most challenging problems in lightning research and by the investigation of the least-understood processes of lightning. With the recent development of lightning experiments, observations and theories, great progress has been made in lightning research. The work will fill a gap in the knowledge of electrical breakdown processes of lightning to further advance the current understanding of lightning, and it will also result in development of an advanced computer model and code that will be used for lightning research for years to come.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>Broader impacts of these activities include: (1) advancement of scientific knowledge in a subject that may contribute to improving the current practice and/or developing new techniques to better forecast severe weather, especially under the increasing pressure of adapting to climate change, (2) improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, (3) development of STEM workforce, (4) participation of women and underrepresented minorities in scientific research, (5) development of simulation software and approaches that will benefit research work in other areas such as laboratory plasma discharges and high-altitude sprites and jets, and (6) broad dissemination of the results in the forms of refereed publications, conference presentations, public lectures and press releases."

The results can serve as bench marks with which to verify theoretical models of the processes. Theoretical models are themselves useful because they may be then conveniently applied to physical systems that are more difficult or more expensive to study experimentally. The amount of energy transfer arising from collisions between atoms and molecules will be studied by using two lasers. First, the internal properties of the quantum states of molecules will be manipulated by a laser beam. These molecules then oscillate like vibrating violin strings and collisions can alter their quantum properties. A second probe laser will arrive at the system after some time delay and sense this alteration. By varying the delay time between the two lasers as short as 10 picoseconds, time evolution of the molecular properties can be mapped out, similar to the way a stroboscope maps out the motion of macroscopic objects. These studies can provide exceptional spectroscopic precision and understanding of the various transfer processes.<br/><br/>This project provides understanding of energy transfer processes that are important in combustion and plasma formation. It has an essential and socially important educational aspect as well.

For example, it is thought to be an important organizing mechanism in atmospheric dynamics that helps to explain why hurricanes retain their characteristic vortex shape for extended periods of time. Despite being a fundamental physical mechanism, the theoretical and mathematical analysis of nonlinear phase mixing has remained elusive. Moreover, many of these effects are difficult to isolate in computational or physical experiments and here mathematical analysis can provide important insights. This project specifically aims to expand our mathematical understanding by studying the effect in a variety of fundamental 'case studies' found in fluid mechanics and plasma physics.<br/><br/>The purpose of this program is to further the mathematical analysis of nonlinear phase mixing, generally regarded as difficult due to the appearance of highly non-normal linear evolutions and unusual regularity issues intertwined with subtle nonlinear resonances. The PI will work to develop new tools necessary to approach these problems with a focus on working towards four specific settings: the vanishing viscosity limit of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) near the 2D Couette flow, the nonlinear instability of 3D shear flows, inviscid 'vortex axisymmetrization' in 2D Euler and Landau damping in Vlasov-Poisson (or Vlasov-Maxwell) in presence of external magnetic fields. Many related physically relevant problems exist, and may serve as intermediate steps or additional lines of research. The work in fluid mechanics will expand further on ideas employed by the PI and collaborator Nader Masmoudi in the recent work on the stability of 2D Couette flow [arXiv:1306.5028], especially the use of adaptive coordinate systems and the construction of norms which account for weakly nonlinear resonances and the non-normal transient linear behavior. The work in kinetic theory will further develop techniques used in the work of the PI and collaborators Nader Masmoudi and Clement Mouhot on Landau damping [arXiv:1311.2870], especially the efficient treatment of the plasma echoes. Most likely, in order to expand the range of kinetic theory applications, some ideas from the work in fluid mechanics may need to be adapted to the kinetic setting."

A characteristic feature on the nightside of Earth is a cyclic storage and explosive release of energy in the magnetic field. The detailed understanding of how magnetic energy is converted into heating and large-scale transport of the plasma in this process still eludes us. One outstanding question concerns the acceleration of electrons to very high energies. Observations show that this happens on a much larger scale than can easily be explained by the small-scale physical processes involved. Recent studies have confirmed the large-scale dynamics of the nightside region during these events as the dominant source for the energization. Entangling the complex mix of processes over a wide range of scales for a comprehensive, quantitative description of the generation and evolution of the energetic electrons is an important current challenge in magnetospheric physics. This project will utilize a combination of advanced computer codes to simulate the effects on the particles of both the small- and large-scale processes involved. Simulation results from three real-life events observed by spacecraft will be analyzed and compared to determine where and how electrons are accelerated during these events. The novel multi-scale approach the team will employ promises to provide the first quantitative assessment of the relative roles of the various processes. It will also provide crucial new insights into the importance of cross-scale coupling. The magnetic energy conversion process that is the subject of this study is a generic plasma physics process that operates in a wide range of space and laboratory plasmas. The Earth's magnetosphere is a natural laboratory for studying such processes, where both simulations and direct observations are possible. Results from this project therefore will impact a broad variety of research areas. <br/><br/>When the electrons with great energy are propelled back toward Earth, they can impact the near-Earth space environment. Some are trapped in the stronger magnetic field there and contribute to the make-up of the Earth radiation belts. Others precipitate into the upper atmosphere where the impact contributes to the creation, amongst others, of strong auroral displays. The disturbance effects in the space environment near Earth are of concern for satellites and other technological systems on the Earth surface that might be affected. This adds broad societal relevance and importance to the research study. The project will integrate research and education through the training of a graduate student. The graduate student will work with members of the team to complement his thesis work on multi-scale processes. In addition, a number of undergraduate interns will participate in the project during the summers. Finally, the PI is a founder and member of the program committee for the International School for Space Simulations (ISSS). This school focuses on student learning of simulation techniques. The PI will continue her active involvement with this activity as part of this project. <br/><br/>This is a numerical modeling project focused on the magnetotail. Its goal is to determine where and how electrons are accelerated during magnetospheric substorms. The aim is to understand the multi-scale nature of the acceleration process by including the effects of kinetic processes that occur near the neutral line while taking into account the global changes in the configuration of the magnetotail. In particular, the study will quantify the relative role of reconnection and dipolarization fronts in energizing electrons during substorm events. Previous investigations of the acceleration of electrons associated with dipolarization fronts have been carried out using either local particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations or large-scale kinetic calculations based on following large numbers of electrons in the time dependent electric and magnetic fields obtained from global Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) simulations. Here, a multi-scale approach will be adopted that incorporates the effects of kinetic processes, including wave-particle interactions that occur near the neutral line, while taking into account the global changes in the configuration of the magnetotail. The results of global MHD simulations will be used to determine the initial and boundary conditions of a three-dimensional particle in cell simulation by setting the magnetic fields and particle flows at the boundaries to the values given by the MHD results. The simulation system will include the region of fast outflow emanating from the reconnection site that drives the formation of dipolarization fronts. The acceleration seen in the implicit-particle-in-cell code (iPIC3d) will be characterized in order to address the questions of electron energization near the reconnection site. Finally, large-scale kinetic simulations using the electric and magnetic fields from the MHD simulation will provide information on energization and precipitation loss as the dipolarization front moves earthward. The effects of adiabatic and non-adiabatic heating of the electrons will be compared and contrasted between several simulations to determine whether the predominant acceleration and heating mechanisms are different for various substorms and what causes that variation."

NASA's THEMIS spacecraft were launched into favorable orbits to study the interaction of solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. These spacecraft are often positioned so that geomagnetic field lines connect them to the upper atmospheric regions in view of the ground-based observing stations. Relating the satellite data to their auroral footprints has revolutionized abilities to study dynamic processes in the solar wind and geospace. During winter times the high-latitude regions can be permanently in dark permitting optical observations of the aurora even at magnetic midday. As two-dimensional dynamic images of the aurora are signatures of plasma processes operating on the flux tube at some distance above the Earth, the joint studies of the THEMIS plasma data and optical instruments deployed at the South Pole and Automatic Geophysical Observatories in the Antarctic provide a unique opportunity to answer four specific questions: (1) Do existing geomagnetic field models accurately map the dayside magnetospheric boundaries? (2) Are the dayside soft aurora ""footprints"" of the magnetospheric cusp and whether they occur on open field lines? (3) When do latitudinal motions of the dayside aurora represent in-out motion of the Earth's magnetopause? (4) What is the mechanism responsible for the production of the frequently observed Poleward Moving Auroral Forms?

While plant cell wall polysaccharides collectively represent the most abundant molecules on the planet, many aspects of cell wall formation remain unclear. For example, hemicelluloses and pectins are synthesized within the cell, transported to the plasma membrane, and organized to form a functional cell wall. However, the mechanisms of polysaccharide transport and organization are unknown, primarily due to the fact that these polysaccharides cannot be visualized by traditional methods. The Wallace lab has previously demonstrated that a metabolically incorporated monosaccharide analog compatible with ""click"" chemistry can be used to circumvent these issues and fluorescently label cell wall polysaccharides. This research supported through the NSF-EAGER mechanism will build upon these findings by developing novel probes to visualize plant cell wall polysaccharides as they move throughout the cell and into the cell wall. By developing techniques to ""see"" cell wall polysaccharides in their native environment, these tools will facilitate the investigation of plant cell wall polysaccharide synthesis and transport in fundamentally unique ways that are unattainable with existing technologies. The results of this project will provide a deeper understanding of plant cell wall formation, which could be utilized to produce biomass crops with tailored cell wall compositions for human utilization. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>Plants annually assimilate 1011 metric tons of CO2, and a large portion of the resulting reduced carbon is partitioned into plant cell walls, the polysaccharide-rich extracellular matrices surrounding all plant cells. Plant cell wall polysaccharides can be grouped into 3 categories: cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. While cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane, hemicelluloses and pectins are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, delivered to the plasma membrane via a poorly characterized vesicle-mediated trafficking pathway, and deposited into the extracellular space, where they become organized to form a functional cell wall. The mechanistic details of non-cellulosic polysaccharide trafficking and organization remain unclear, primarily due to the lack of available methods to visualize plant cell wall polysaccharides. The Wallace group previously demonstrated that Fucose alkyne (FucAl), an analog of the naturally occurring cell wall monosaccharide fucose, is metabolically incorporated into plant tissue and can be fluorescently labeled with azide-containing fluorophores using the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. This sugar analog specifically reports the sites of fucose incorporation into pectin and can be used to examine pectin dynamics in native cell walls. This project will build on these ideas by synthesizing and implementing novel monosaccharide analogs of common cell wall sugars that are compatible with click chemistry, and utilizing these metabolic probes to label unique cell wall polysaccharides. Rationally-designed azide-containing monosaccharide analogs will be synthesized and will be assayed for incorporation into cell walls. Furthermore, the labeled polysaccharides, incorporation pathway metabolic enzymes, and reactivity of individual sugars will be investigated. This project will fundamentally change the way that cell wall polysaccharide trafficking is investigated, and will provide key insights into the nanoscale structure and trafficking of non-cellulosic cell wall polysaccharides. Additionally, this project will support advanced graduate education in the developing field of plant chemical biology, will provide advanced undergraduate research education through the UNR Department of Biochemistry senior thesis program, and will support an inter-departmental chemical ecology and chemical biology colloquium."

A detailed understanding of magnetic reconnection, therefore, is an important component of understanding the physical processes responsible for space weather at Earth. Magnetic reconnection governs the dynamics and heating of other astrophysical plasmas as well. The process occurs on length scales much shorter than can be observed remotely, but the released energy and changes in magnetic structure have important global consequences. The objective of this project is to perform numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere that result in predictions that are suitable for comparison with solar observations. The results will provide new understanding of the observational signatures of reconnection and new understanding of the role of small-scale structures in rapid reconnection and particle acceleration. <br/><br/>The project includes significant science education and public outreach components. Members of the proposal team will mentor undergraduate summer interns. Funding is also included to coordinate outreach efforts by solar physicists for a local science festival. Each year, this festival brings in hundreds of members of the public of all ages, with exhibits designed to be informative to everyone in attendance<br/><br/>This research project is aimed at characterizing the small-scale structure in density, temperature, and energy within the reconnection region, which is vital for the dynamics of reconnection and particle acceleration. If strong variations in temperature or density exist, then this will substantially impact the ionization evolution and consequently the interpretation of observations. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations will be performed, with a focus on investigating how the tearing and plasmoid instabilities drive turbulence and enhance reconnection rates. The statistical properties of the nonlinear dynamics resulting from these instabilities will be investigated to provide insight into particle acceleration and the dynamics of reconnection. While most observations of solar eruptions are interpreted under the assumption that the plasma is in ionization equilibrium, the time scales for ionization and recombination are often comparable to or longer than the time scales of the eruption. The observational predictions will therefore be made using time-dependent ionization modeling in the post processing, including the effects of non-thermal particle distributions."

The Earth is protected from the direct impact of the solar wind by its magnetic field that extends out to high altitudes and causes the solar wind to be deflected around it. When the Earth?s magnetic field becomes connected to the Sun's magnetic field through a process called magnetic merging, some of the solar wind energy enters near-Earth space. The interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere accelerates plasma particles to energies high enough to threaten spacecraft electronics and astronaut health, and in addition, creates mega-ampere electric currents in the upper atmosphere that can disrupt power grids on the Earth's surface. To predict space weather and thus provide some warning to implement mediation strategies, it is important to understand the conditions in the solar wind that actually hit the magnetosphere. Complications arise because to get sufficient lead-time for the prediction to be of value, the solar wind must be measured upstream of the Earth. However, this undisturbed solar wind is not what eventually triggers the space storming. Instead the solar wind is modified as it forms a bow shock and a layer of shocked and heated plasma (called the magnetosheath) before arriving at the magnetosphere. As a result, it is important to be able to relate observations of the undisturbed solar wind far upstream of the Earth with the solar wind that actually arrives and then to the space storm that is produced. The results of this study will be used for graduate and undergraduate education purposes, and will be disseminated widely. Taking a longer-range perspective, a better understanding of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction will likely result in improvements to space weather forecasting of value to society and will be relevant to the study of planetary and astrophysical plasma environments. Related space weather topics will be featured in public outreach activities in various venues. A partnership with the Public Information and Outreach Education Office at the Geophysical Institute will significantly increase the scope of the outreach activities beyond the proposing team alone.<br/><br/>Observations indicate that a population of solar wind ions reflects from the bow shock, travels back toward the Sun and interacts non-linearly with the incoming solar wind producing a variety of transient features (i.e., hot flow anomalies, foreshock cavitons, and density holes) upstream of the bow shock. Though these transients have been observed for decades, the underlying physical mechanisms that produce them, how they modify the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, and the types of signatures that result within near-Earth space are still not understood. Since the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere produces the transients and the transients feed back to modify the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, these features must be studies as a connected system in order to identify the underlying mechanisms. The present work will use observations to identify the various types of solar wind transients, and the conditions under which they are produced, and then use simulations to identify the underlying physical mechanisms. This holistic approach is expected to produce important advances."

Initial observations by the McMurdo radar show abundance of short-range echoes with properties very similar to auroral E-region echoes but at locations with very high geometric aspect angles. The project's research will address a fundamental question of why E-region echoes from the polar cap are observed at all by the McMurdo radar. These investigations will include further examination of the previously found auroral echoes with unusual properties, e.g., velocities greatly exceeding nominal ion-acoustic speed and independent of the plasma flow angle. They will also evaluate the extent of magnetic conjugacy of the E-region radar aurora and establish the relationship between E-region irregularities and plasma drift velocities.

Led by the Von Karman Institute (VKI) of Belgium, the QB50 project is predominantly funded from a FP7 Grant by the European Union (EU) and includes international participation from more than 30 countries. The idea behind the project is that the EU grant will supply the science instruments and a joint launch for all 50 satellites, which will be provided by participating teams that will secure their own independent funding for CubSat production and ground station operation. The plan for QB50 is that all 50 CubeSats will be launched together in 2015-2016 on a Shtil-2.1 from Murmansk in northern Russia into a circular orbit at 320 km altitude, inclination 79. Due to atmospheric drag, the orbits will decay and the CubeSats will be able to explore all layers of the lower thermosphere without the need for on-board propulsion, down to 90 or 100 km, depending on the quality of their thermal design. It is expected that the network will spread around the Earth (in a single orbit plane) providing a range of spacing and temporal revisit times. The lifetime of the CubeSats from deployment until atmosphere re-entry will be less than three months. Each QB50 satellite is required to carry one of three standardized sensor packages: a plasma package, a neutral package or a composition package. The plasma package is based on a miniaturized Langmuir probe providing plasma density, the neutral package measures the atomic and molecular Oxygen density, and the composition package is an Ion-Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS).<br/><br/>The partners of the QBUS consortium (3 research universities, one Hispanic minority undergraduate university, and 2 national laboratories) all have significant CubeSat and Ionosphere-Thermosphere (IT) science experience. The QBUS team will build 4 identical 2U CubeSat flight units based on a joint design, with participating members providing various components of the usual satellite functions (attitude determination and control, uplink and downlink telecommunications, power subsystem including a battery and body-mounted solar cells, on-board data handling and storage by a CPU). Of the three available options, the QBUS team has been approved by the QB50 project to fly the INMS sensor built by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL). This instrument will measure atmospheric composition via abundance determination of neutral atomic O, molecular O2 and N2. QBUS as part of QB50 offers a unique opportunity for dense and distributed in-situ measurements of the most poorly characterized state parameter: neutral and ion composition from 100-320 km. The project will use measurements from QBUS, QB50, and complementary ground-based observations to characterize and understand how compositional changes are created by energy inputs, propagated and ultimately equilibrated within the IT system. Specifically, it will be possible, for the first time, to quantify the effect of composition changes (primarily O/N2) on electron density changes across temporal scales (minutes to months) and spatial scales (10-s km to global).<br/><br/>The project constitutes a particularly creative and cost-effective approach. The multi-university and national Laboratory solution proposed entails partners sharing and leading by their specific strengths. Efficiency of numbers and division of labor by experience will result in tremendous program costs savings. In addition, QBUS constitutes substantial leveraging on the international QB50 project. As a result of U.S. funded participation in QB50 the entire U.S. science community will have the opportunity to access the full constellation dataset from QB50. The QB50/QBUS program also serves as impetus for unprecedented coordination between NSF-sponsored facilities and instruments for in-situ and ground based campaigns to enable IT discovery.

Electric fields, produced by the interaction of the magnetosphere with the onrushing solar wind ultimately are responsible for the auroral oval but they also cause high-energy electrons and ions to drift deep into the inner magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere maps along magnetic field lines into the midlatitude ionosphere causing disturbances there. On the dusk side of the inner magnetosphere, the ions penetrate closer to the Earth (and thus to lower latitudes) than the electrons. The weak magnetic field-aligned currents associated with ion pressure gradients at high altitude in space surrounding the Earth close through the low-density sub-auroral ionosphere on the dusk side and in the process produce strong westward electric fields that set the subauroral ionospheric plasma in motion. The electric fields and the drifts they produce in the ionosphere are called subauroral polarization streams (SAPS). The resulting strong ionospheric electric fields map back out along magnetic field lines producing effects in the magnetosphere. This coupling is important in producing space weather disturbances. The proposal will develop an empirical model based on a suite of low-earth orbiting satellites that describes the global distribution of SAPS fields in the ionosphere as a function of solar and geophysical conditions. An important aspect of this work is an investigation of the feedback between the electrical conductance of the ionosphere and the SAPS evolution. The results will contribute to our ability to understand and predict the temporal evolution of space weather disturbances and their impacts on vulnerable technologies. Of particular importance, SAPS draw dense plasma from the dayside ionosphere in plumes up over the polar cap, which can disrupt GPS signals resulting in large errors in global positioning. A graduate student will be trained on the project at the University of Texas.<br/><br/>The proposers will use 80 years of ionospheric observations covering different local time sectors taken by satellites in the Defense Meteorological Satellite, Dynamics Explorer, and Atmosphere Explorer Programs. These will be sorted by solar activity and geophysical parameters to construct the first empirical model of subauroral electric fields. The data will also be used in a superposed epoch analysis of magnetic storms to understand the evolution of the SAPS electric fields during different stages of the storm. The RCM-E model, which combines the Rice Convection Model (RCM) with an equilibrium (self-consistent) magnetic field model (E), is a physics-based model that will be used to explore the evolution of the SAPS and test how ionospheric conductance affects this evolution. Given the plasma distribution for each species along with the magnetic field and electric potential at the outer boundary of the inner magnetosphere at high altitude, and the electric conductance pattern in the ionosphere, RCM solves for the electrodynamics of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. An important new aspect of this work is the focus on the effects of ion-neutral coupling through the changes it produces in the imposed ionospheric conductance pattern (i.e., progressive decrease in subauroral density as the storm progresses)."

It is focused research where the topics are selected by the scientific community based on their importance and timeliness. <br/>An understanding of dynamics of the magnetosphere requires a quantitative understanding of the sources of the plasma. There are two main sources of plasma for the magnetosphere: the solar wind and the ionosphere. In order to understand the solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere system it is important that both sources of plasma be included in models of the overall all system. Most emphasis over the years has been on the solar wind source. This proposal will quantify the outflow from the ionosphere. The approach in this study will be to use the Coupled Magnetosphere Ionosphere Thermosphere (CMIT) simulation system including a new, flexible polar wind outflow module (IPW). The resulting simulation code will be made available to the entire space physics community through the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC).<br/>This study will address two questions: 1) which classes of ion outflow have the most significant effects on the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system and 2) to what extent do the effects of ion outflow on the coupled MIT dynamics depend on the mechanism producing the outflow? Three versions of the polar wind module will be developed: 1) a classical polar wind model, 2) a configuration where the upper boundary conditions on the polar wind are set by the magnetospheric model, thereby allowing centrifugal forces and pressure gradients to provide the outflow, and 3) a configuration which includes a heuristic model of transversely accelerated ions regulated by inputs like the Alfvenic Poynting flux. The three types of outflow will be evaluated by calculating their influences on the polar cap potential, Dst, hemispheric outflow rates and hemispheric power, and qualitative changes in the magnetospheric convection."

The plan for QB50 is that all 50 CubeSats will be launched together in 2015-2016 on a Shtil-2.1 from Murmansk in northern Russia into a circular orbit at 320 km altitude, inclination 79. Due to atmospheric drag, the orbits will decay and the CubeSats will be able to explore all layers of the lower thermosphere without the need for on-board propulsion, down to 90 or 100 km, depending on the quality of their thermal design. It is expected that the network will spread around the Earth (in a single orbit plane) providing a range of spacing and temporal revisit times. The lifetime of the CubeSats from deployment until atmosphere re-entry will be less than three months. Each QB50 satellite is required to carry one of three standardized sensor packages: a plasma package, a neutral package or a composition package.

These pathways are characterized by a chain of remodeling events during which an almost flat patch of plasma membrane is transformed into a cargo-carrying closed vesicle. The most commonly used pathway is called clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) which is important for the exchange of lipids and proteins between the plasma membrane and organelles. As such, CME is critical for maintaining the organization of the plasma membrane and regulating various cellular processes. Recent research on CME suggests that cells sense the mechanical environment by adapting the protein machinery to ensure successful CME. How cells sense and adapt to the mechanical environment to maintain cellular transport is not well understood. The goal of this project is to gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic adaptation in cells via combined theoretical and experimental approaches. Since cells experience varied mechanical environments in different diseased states, this work can provide fundamental insights into cellular transport in diseased cells that can help facilitate the design of improved nanoparticle-based drugs.<br/><br/>This work will offer a physical explanation for the observed ""mechanosensitivity"" and tension-based adaptation in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To achieve this objective, continuum mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations of membrane-protein interactions will be complimented with high-resolution live cell and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to test the competing explanations for assembly of membrane-associated proteins and tension-induced adaptation in CME. This study will address two major debates in the endocytosis literature. First, it will identify the energetically optimal mechanism by which clathrin drives membrane curvature. Second, it will identify the mechanism by which membrane senses tension and recruits actin filaments for driving vesicle growth. The numerical and experimental findings will quantify the extent to which the key membrane-remodeling proteins can counter tension and drive vesicle growth. Overall, these findings would reveal the general principles by which tension regulates the assembly of membrane-remodeling proteins."

The most commonly used pathway is called clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) which is important for the exchange of lipids and proteins between the plasma membrane and organelles. As such, CME is critical for maintaining the organization of the plasma membrane and regulating various cellular processes. Recent research on CME suggests that cells sense the mechanical environment by adapting the protein machinery to ensure successful CME. How cells sense and adapt to the mechanical environment to maintain cellular transport is not well understood. The goal of this project is to gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic adaptation in cells via combined theoretical and experimental approaches. Since cells experience varied mechanical environments in different diseased states, this work can provide fundamental insights into cellular transport in diseased cells that can help facilitate the design of improved nanoparticle-based drugs.<br/><br/>This work will offer a physical explanation for the observed ""mechanosensitivity"" and tension-based adaptation in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To achieve this objective, continuum mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations of membrane-protein interactions will be complimented with high-resolution live cell and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to test the competing explanations for assembly of membrane-associated proteins and tension-induced adaptation in CME. This study will address two major debates in the endocytosis literature. First, it will identify the energetically optimal mechanism by which clathrin drives membrane curvature. Second, it will identify the mechanism by which membrane senses tension and recruits actin filaments for driving vesicle growth. The numerical and experimental findings will quantify the extent to which the key membrane-remodeling proteins can counter tension and drive vesicle growth. Overall, these findings would reveal the general principles by which tension regulates the assembly of membrane-remodeling proteins."

The approach can be generalized to systems that interact with fluids or structures and/or systems with delay. This project creates a new framework for optimal control of systems described by delayed or partial differential equations (PDEs) based on convex optimization of polynomial variables. A three-step approach is used: First, optimal control of delayed and partial-differential system is expressed as convex optimization of positive operators; Second, positive polynomials are used to parameterize the cone of positive operators; Finally, Sum-of-Squares and semi-definite programming are used to optimize the positive polynomials. The result is a sequence of tractable algorithms for direct control of distributed-parameter systems with decreasing error bounds.<br/><br/>Structural or fluid components are modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) can include plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor, blood flow around an aneurysm, or vibration in an aircraft wing. Sources of delay can include control over a network such as the Internet. Control of systems modeled by PDEs can be challenging due to its complexity. This project considers the control of nuclear fusion plasma - which has yet to experimentally sustain a positive net energy production - the resulting improvement in efficiency may have long-term implications for future worldwide energy production. The project will leverage international collaboration through NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) Global Venture Fund (GVF) co-funding and integrate with local middle and high school programs to promote energy education as well as building support and public awareness for high-energy magnetic confinement fusion and its role in the national and global energy discussion."

In this application, the charge will be stimulated by the passage of charged particles passing through the gas cells and can be sensed electronically. The identity of which cells have been charged provides the spatial information on the particles. Preliminary tests suggest that it will be possible for these devices to detect particles in a billionth of a second and that cells can be made with a size of about one tenth of a millimeter. Using experience from commercial providers of flat screen televisions, it is hoped that these detectors can be larger and cheaper than the types in use in other particle physics instruments today.

The project includes studying the effects of the KHW on solar wind entry into the magnetosphere and their impact on the inner magnetosphere. The research will be based on a combination of global magnetosphere simulations and extensive and intensive analysis of KHW observations from spacecraft to explore the global distribution of the occurrence and characteristics of KHW over the surface of the magnetopause. Direct spatial and temporal observations of KHW under a variety of solar wind conditions are lacking, with the result that the generation, development, and impact of these magnetopause waves are far from being fully understood in geospace. Statistical studies of KHW including sufficient numbers of conjunctive observations using multiple spacecraft will provide direct spatial and temporal observations of the generation and evolution of KHW and the effect of KHW on plasma transport and the inner magnetosphere. The study will be enhanced by global magnetohydrodynamic simulations that are suitable for investigating large-scale physical processes and their evolution. The goal of the study is to better understand the physics of the Earth?s magnetopause and the response of the inner magnetosphere to solar wind inputs that reach the magnetopause. Understanding the generation and evolution of the KHW at the magnetopause will have a large impact not only on terrestrial magnetospheric physics, but also on other magnetized (Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn) and unmagnetized (Mars and Venus) planetary interactions with the solar wind. The relationship between the ultra-low frequency waves observed in the inner magnetosphere and the KHW on the magnetospause and the importance and effectiveness of plasma transport facilitated by KHW into the plasma sheet and inner magnetosphere are important for better space weather forecasting.

This investment by the NSF will support researchers working within various disciplines at Northeastern University (marine science, environmental science, global change, geology, chemistry, biology, osteology, public health, engineering), as well as at other regional institutions. Specific research projects that will be enhanced by acquisition of LA-ICP-MS at Northeastern include the reconstruction of past seawater temperature and acidity from coral cores, experiments on marine organisms that require chemical labelling of their shell or skeleton, research investigating metal incorporation in carbonate minerals, investigations of fish population structure and connectivity using chemical fingerprinting of the ear-bones (""otoliths"") of fish, and numerous other projects investigating marine ecosystems, shell and skeletal production, materials synthesis, drug discovery, and environmental toxins. Instrument use by junior, mid-level, and senior faculty, and their postdoctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students, and technical staff, will provide critical educational and instrument training opportunities for users with varying levels of expertise across a range of scientific disciplines. Acquisition of LA-ICP-MS will be particularly valuable for the career development of several young faculty who are developing novel research projects and are poised to take full advantage of the mass resolution, sensitivity, and substrate versatility afforded by LA-ICP-MS. Faculty and staff at Northeastern have established an excellent record of involving students at all levels of scientific research, and this emphasis on student involvement will be fully integrated with the management and operation of this instrumentation.<br/><br/>The LA-ICP-MS system to be acquired through this award combines key technological capabilities that will facilitate analytical research at Northeastern and beyond. These capabilities include (1) high precision and accuracy; (2) broad mass range (6 < atomic mass < 260, > 70 elements); (3) substrate versatility (liquids and solids), including in-situ measurement of solid substrates via laser ablation at < 5 micron spatial resolution; (4) ultra-low detection limits (ppq-to-ppm); and (5) rapid, simultaneous analysis of multiple isotopes (> 20) afforded by the system's high sensitivity, rapid adjustment of magnetic field strength, and minimal sample preparation requirements. The analytical versatility of LA-ICP-MS is required for the broad range of research projects of multiple early career, mid-level, and senior researchers at Northeastern. These projects include investigating temporal trends in carbonate mineralogy, developing a multielemental paleothermometer and B/Ca-based paleo-pH proxy to reconstruct recent oceanic change from coral skeletal geochemistry, isotopic labeling of carbonate shells and skeletons in ocean acidification experiments, investigating trace element partitioning in synthetic and biogenic carbonates, elemental fingerprinting of fish otoliths to investigate population structure and connectivity, and numerous other projects in the fields of marine ecology, biomineralization, bone pathology, materials synthesis, nano-engineering, drug discovery, and toxicology. These projects are at the forefront of their respective fields, yet their ultimate success, especially for the early career scientists, hinges on ready access to the proposed instrumentation.

It is driven by applications in gas dynamics and plasma physics as well by mathematical interests in analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Kinetic equations are used to describe evolution of interacting particles, such as gas molecules, ions and electrons in a plasma. The most famous kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation: formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, this equation describes motion of a large class of gases. Later, in 1936 Lev Landau derived from the Boltzmann equation a new mathematical model for motion of plasma. This latter equation was named the Landau equation. Despite the fact that many mathematicians and physicists have been working on these equations, many important questions are still unanswered due to their mathematical complexity. The proposed research will fundamentally contribute to this field by bridging the gap between mathematical analysis and physics and enable further mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. The work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen inter-institutional ties. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to (i) broaden the students' understanding of different research areas, (ii) provide the students with a modern skill set that is essential for different career paths, and (iii) promote existing connections between local institutions in the DC Metro area and help establish new avenues for collaboration and training of high quality scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the knowledge in global properties of solutions to collisional kinetic mathematical models, improving our understanding of non-linear dynamics, entropy, equilibrium, and regularizing effects. The corresponding equations contain integro-differential operators that are highly nonlinear, singular and with degenerating coefficients. Integro-differential equations of this type have received increased attention recently: well-posedness and regularity theory are being developed since many new applications have emerged, among which conformal geometry, stochastic control and image processing. The project aims at advancing knowledge in the theories of kinetic equations, nonlocal integro-differential operators and degenerate differential operators."

Due to the ability of THz waves to penetrate through barrier materials (clothes, packaging, etc.), and to perform non-contact and non-ionizing testing, THz systems are positioned to compete with more hazardous and less sensitive technologies like X-rays and will allow resolving images that other technologies cannot resolve. The proposed system based on THz detection would enable the development of new nanostructured THz devices with applications in homeland security, biotechnology, and medicine.<br/><br/>The project will result in a low-cost commercial prototype of the terahertz plasma-wave SOC (system on chip) detector. The device will feature a wide spectral range (0.3-3 THz), an improved time resolution by optimizing device packaging and building integrated signal processing elements, which would allow logic operations with multiple terahertz pulses, such as measuring delays between pulses and extracting pulse position modulation information. This will extend the feasibility of such devices to the emerging fields of THz communication and THz logic systems. Traditional detectors of terahertz radiation include pyroelectric detectors and bolometers, which are very slow (typically within Hz or kHz bandwidth). Such systems are acceptable for measuring the average THz power, but unable to resolve short individual pulses. Existing fast Schottky diode based detectors didn't receive wide acceptance in short pulse terahertz applications due to their static sensitivity and low electrical breakdown thresholds. The proposed device addresses these issues in a silicon integrated platform. While the terahertz spectrum has a great potential for applications in imaging, sensing, spectroscopy, and ultra-broadband wireless communications, realizing this potential requires lowering the equipment cost and size and developing highly efficient, fast, and compact sources and detectors. The proposed integrated SOC plasma wave detector system will be uniquely suited for the THz market. The development of such prototype will include: (1) Design and fabrication of integrated amplifier for RF coupling of the detector output with transient digitizer module with an RF bandwidth up to 50 GHz. (2) Design and fabrication of integrated terahertz antenna for the active element and collimating lens for optimization of THz radiation coupling efficiency, and increase of effective terahertz cross section of the detector. (3) Design of integrated data acquisition module. <br/><br/>The project engages industry, foundries, and university venture development organization to augment research capability, provide test environment, and guide the commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

The work is based on stochastic structural stability theory (SSST), a theoretical framework which the Principal Investigator has developed in the context of geophysical fluid dynamics. The SSST method framework is used to create equations for the mutual interaction of turbulence and coherent structures, and the equilibrium solutions of the equations identify the statistical mean states of the system. For example, when the theory is applied to the formation of jet streams due to interactions between the zonal-mean atmospheric flow and wave motions, it predicts an entire bifurcation structure from jet emergence as a linear instability to finite amplitude equilibration followed by a specific series of structural bifurcations as a function of parameters, such as turbulence intensity, as well as existence of limit cycles and chaotic mean state behavior. Applications of the theory considered here include the formation of zonal jets in planetary atmospheres, jet formation in toroidally confined plasmas, the self-sustaining magnetic fields of planets, boundary layer turbulence accompanied by streamwise rolls and streaks (of interest in meteorology and oceanography), and the maintenance of turbulent angular momentum transport in Keplerian discs required for planetary formation.<br/><br/>The project has broader scientific impacts in that it seeks to identify unifying principles for phenomena in several scientific disciplines that are not currently recognized as having the same underlying structures and dynamics. The unifying, cross-disciplinary nature of the work to be performed is the justification for funding the project through the INSPIRE mechanism."

Sintering processes are widely used for the manufacturing of metallic, ceramic, and composite components for automotive, aerospace, defense, and machine tool industries. However, it is often very challenging to sinter the components free from processing-related undesirable changes in structure and properties of materials. Controlling the structure of materials during sintering becomes particularly important for highly temperature-sensitive materials such as amorphous alloys. These materials are being considered for several applications due to their outstanding mechanical and electrochemical properties. This award supports fundamental research related to the development of sintering processes for the amorphous alloys and their composites and coatings. The results of this research will lead to innovations in the strategic area of advanced manufacturing of engineering materials, identified as a key to national economic development. The research will also promote the participation of diverse groups of students in manufacturing research. <br/><br/>In spite of their attractive properties, actual utilization of amorphous alloys in practical applications has been limited primarily due to difficulties in processing of bulk shapes using conventional solidification processing. The spark plasma sintering process involving simultaneous application of pulsed direct current and uniaxial pressure offers interesting possibilities of manufacturing bulk amorphous alloys without undesirable changes in material structure. The research team will perform experiments to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of densification for the spark plasma sintering of bulk amorphous alloys, particle reinforced and laminated composites, and thick amorphous alloy coatings. The research will elucidate the mechanisms of evolution of nanocrystalline size distribution in amorphous alloys, ductility development in composites, and tribological corrosion behavior of amorphous composite coatings. The major objective is to establish the processing-microstructure-properties correlations in these areas of research. Successful completion of this research would significantly advance the state-of-the-art in spark plasma sintering of amorphous metallic alloys leading to wider industry acceptance of the sintering technology and engineered amorphous materials in a wide range of applications."

The GR process permits radio emission to provide direct measurements of magnetic field strength and direction in the solar corona, and so supplies the key to understanding the basic mechanisms underlying all of solar activity. This team's recent work in comparing spatially and spectrally resolved radio emission with magnetic field extrapolations of photospheric magnetograms and other data has suggested that an extension of existing theory to non-Maxwellian particle distributions may be needed to account for the observed altitudes of solar radio sources. The PI therefore will develop a comprehensive modeling framework for flaring loops that is capable of reproducing physically realistic solar atmospheric structure, including distributions of non-thermal particles. <br/><br/>The PI's existing tools have already successfully calculated both gyrosynchrotron (GS) radio emission and hard X-ray emission for forward-fitting microwave and X-ray observations of solar flares. Here, the team plans to modify this general framework to model GR emission. This requires a separate development effort to deal with specific issues arising from the GR process, including grid resolution problems, the treatment of the process in spherical coordinates to deal with the large fields of view involved in active region emission, and the development of a consistent way to specify ambient solar plasma temperature and density in addition to the magnetic field. <br/><br/>In this effort, the PI's team will develop user-friendly software tools for the solar and space weather community, and then widely disseminate them online through the SolarSoft software distribution library. Since this work will be performed at the Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), the activity will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning.

This research will also broadly be applicable beyond solar physics, given that both magnetic fields and plasma particle distributions are fundamentally important in astrophysics studies."

Over the past decade, the terahertz frequency regime, the region of the electromagnetic spectrum located between the microwave and the infra-red, has become the subject of much attention due to its wide range of unique applications in diverse areas such as astronomy, imaging, spectroscopy, security, communications, and so on. Although significant progress has been recently achieved, there is still a need for devices efficiently operating at these frequencies. In particular, there is a necessity for low-cost, compact sources of terahertz radiation. In this context, the research targeted in this proposal tries to provide an answer for a long standing problem for the terahertz community: how to achieve power gain at terahertz frequencies in compact, electronic devices at room-temperature. The proposed devices can offer low cost of manufacturing, and therefore will find many potential industrial applications in future compact terahertz systems (e.g. ""terahertz chips"" for communications, security, and biomedical applications). This research vision is interlaced with an educational vision of mentoring new generations of graduate and undergraduate students in the field of materials, high frequency electronics, terahertz, and optics and stimulating their critical thinking and curiosity by providing them with hands-on experience in cutting-edge research. This is of significant importance given the future projected needs for highly trained engineers and scientists in the United States, and in particular in the state of Utah. The proposed research and educational plans will leverage the ongoing research activities on materials, electronics and optoelectronics and the current outreach programs at the University of Utah.<br/><br/>(Technical) This project aims to develop active terahertz electronic devices (terahertz detectors, oscillators, and amplifiers) based on the interplay between resonant tunneling and electron plasma waves in stacked two-dimensional material layers. These devices promise power gains >7dB at frequencies above 2 THz when in amplifier configurations, which has been proven to be difficult to achieve in traditional high-frequency electronic-devices. The fundamental mechanism enabling gain at terahertz frequencies in these devices is the interplay between negative differential conductance (NDC) and the electron plasma waves in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), i.e. the NDC provides a gain medium for the plasma waves excited in the semiconductor 2DEG. All the challenges associated with these devices are going to be identified and addressed at the materials, device fabrication, and design stages. Of these 2D materials, graphene, can be an excellent platform for plasmonic transport owed to its large room temperature mobility thus low plasmonic damping. Moreover, its intrinsic 2D nature, and its ease of transfer to arbitrary substrates can allow for unlimited degrees of freedom of integration, reduce the cost with respect to that in III-V semiconductors, and allow for more simple fabrication processes. We will also answer questions regarding high quality 2D material preparation: control and optimization of domain size, integrity, inclusions, interface boundaries, contamination, fidelity of crystallography / alignment between stacked layers, and terminating carbon bonding."

The radiation interacts with the atoms in the gas, heats the gas and sometimes ionizes and excites the atoms. The gas then emits light which, in turn, interacts with the gas. The detailed physical processes involved in these interactions are enormously complex and vary with the gas' temperature, density and chemical abundance. Understanding these processes and their interplay with the radiation allows astrophysicists to deduce the physical conditions in the gas clouds and the characteristics of the source of the radiation. Dr. Ferland is one of the world's experts in the study of the interplay of light and ionized gas and for thirty years he has been developing an open-source, publicly-available computer simulation tool called ""Cloudy."" Cloudy is used by hundreds of astronomers and astrophysicists in studies of diverse regions from star-forming regions to the light-emitting regions surrounding and excited by the supermassive black holes at the centers of active galaxies (Active Galactic Nuclei or AGN) and quasars. Cloudy has been used in the training and research of several generations of students and young researchers. This award will support a major upgrade of the Cloudy code that will improve its performance and range of applicability. The upgrade will potentially allow it to be used in simulations of gas in dense plasmas such as star-forming regions and will allow better calculation of the emission of light from gas near the heart of quasars.<br/><br/>This is a time of unprecedented discovery in understanding the central regions of Active Galactic Nuclei and Starburst galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum. Reverberation mapping of the Broad Lined Region, using optical H I recombination lines at low redshift, and collisionally excited lines at high redshift, have led to catalogs of supermassive black hole masses. These in turn make possible investigations of key questions such as the evolution of black hole mass, the role of AGN feedback, and the interplay between the evolution of the black hole and surrounding galaxy. The Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) makes it possible to routinely study radio recombination lines from both AGN and Starburst galaxies, probing sources of ionizing radiation in dust-shrouded regions. ALMA can further probe molecular emission from both star-forming regions and the AGN molecular torus. This project will develop the theoretical tools needed to understand these emission-line observations and incorporate them into Cloudy, which has been designed to solve these plasma, chemistry, radiation transport, and dynamics problems simultaneously and self consistently, building from the foundation of individual atomic and molecular processes. The advances to be undertaken are motivated by recent discussions with the dense plasma / magnetic fusion communities. Methods and data they have developed will dramatically improve the numerical simulations at surprisingly low cost. These significantly improved simulations will be applied to models of the BLR, star-forming regions,and to associated molecular regions."

These proteins bind strongly to the NPs and affect the NPs' interactions with their environment. The goal of this proposal is to quantify the dynamics of proteins binding to NPs and to determine how the proteins may change their structure upon binding. The project will investigate model proteins, as well as proteins in blood plasma. The inclusion of experiments with whole plasma is an attractive feature of this proposed work, as whole plasma reflects the complexity of real-world conditions. The results of this research will be important for the understanding of the fate of nanoparticles, particularly, the bio-accumulation of nanoparticles in the food chain. In addition, understanding the dynamics of protein coating of NPs can be useful for the development of approaches that intentionally coat NPs with proteins in order to prevent other proteins from binding as a strategy to ensure that the NPs do not cause adverse effects on the environment. The PI and Co-PI are both active in outreach to the K-12 community and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>While it is believed that the corona changes over time, as initially the most abundant proteins bind, but are then replaced with proteins that have the largest affinity, very little is known about the time scales of this dynamic exchange among different proteins. The goal of this proposal is to quantify the time-scales of protein-binding to NPs and to determine binding-induced structural changes of the proteins. Correlation spectroscopy will be used to determine the equilibrium protein-NP binding constant and number of bound proteins. The approach will be extended to measure competitive binding among different proteins to the same or possibly different nanoparticles. For protein folding/unfolding on NPs, the PIs will use CD spectroscopy on individual nanoparticles (with the goal of achieving single protein detection levels) and smFRET (single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer) microscopy of donor-acceptor labeled proteins.

It is produced by cellulose synthase, a large multi-subunit complex that resides in the plasma membrane. Genetic studies using the model Arabidopsis have led to the identification of proteins comprising the cellulose synthase machinery as well as critical enzymes and cytoskeletal proteins that interact with the core complex. A potential role for additional factors such as membrane lipids or sterols is intriguing but has not yet been adequately explored. Previous studies demonstrated that sterol composition is crucial for cellulose synthase activity. Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which sterols influence cellulose synthesis are not understood to date. In this project two debated hypotheses to explain the connection between sterols and cellulose synthesis will be tested. The first is that steryl glucosides, an abundant class of sterol conjugates in plants, act as primers for synthesis by transferring glucose residues to the growing chain of cellulose microfibrils. Alternatively or in addition, sterols play a general role in cellulose synthesis, as integral components of detergent-resistant plasma membrane subdomains. Sterols may act to maintain the structure and integrity of transmembrane proteins, such as the subunits that comprise cellulose synthase. To determine which of these mechanisms occurs in the cell, the project will employ an interdisciplinary approach using the primary cell wall as a model. Genetics and chemical genetics, biochemistry and cell biology, in parallel with systems biology approaches spanning genomics, lipidomics and proteomics will be applied. Chemical inhibitors of enzymes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway and mutants of Arabidopsis will be used as tools to dissect the membrane requirements for cellulose synthase function. The ultimate goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular link between sterols and cellulose synthesis in building the cell wall. This research is expected to result in transformative advances in understanding cellulose synthesis, and has strong potential to uncover novel insights in the dynamic interplay between sterols and proteins in the plasma membrane of plant cells. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This research will have broader impacts through the multi-disciplinary education of a postdoctoral scholar, graduate and undergraduate students. Underrepresented groups will be recruited through programs for McNair Scholars, Summer Undergraduate Research Opportunity, and Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. K-12 outreach will be achieved by partnerships with local teachers and programs for girls with interests in science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers. Through an international collaboration with a laboratory in Sweden, this project has broader impacts in training the next generation of US scientists with a global perspective. The information gained from this research will facilitate improvements in plant-derived products and biomass-related applications in biotechnology. Deciphering how the membrane environment influences cellulose synthase machinery may lead to knowledge concerning the digestibility of cellulose and the amount of cellulose that is produced in the cell wall, which are key considerations in engineering bioenergy crops of the future."

For example, consider the $15 billion international nuclear fusion reactor being built in Cadarache, France. Although the world has known for 60 years that it is possible to produce energy from nuclear fusion by heating plasma in a magnetic field, physicists have never been able to control the magnetic field accurately enough to produce significant amounts of power. The reason is that even the simplest models of magneto hydrodynamics involve more than 20 coupled nonlinear differential equations. Although algorithms for control have made great strides in recent years, control of systems of this complexity is still out of reach. This project will design new algorithms for control which use supercomputers and massively parallel computation in an attempt to enable the safe and reliable design of controllers for large complex systems such as describe plasma in a reactor.<br/><br/>At the heart of the project is a new way of using convex optimization to parameterize Lyapunov functions (a measure of energy). Specifically, while the well-known sum-of-squares parameterization of positive polynomials is convex, reliable and accurate for small-scale systems, it cannot be readily adapted to supercomputers and other forms of massively parallel computation. The essence of this project, then is to look for alternative mathematical parameterizations of Lyapunov functions which are convex and furthermore are amenable to parallel computation. Such alternatives exist in classical mathematical results by Handelman, Polya and Bernstein. The scope of work is to use those results to create parallel codes, which can study multiple coupled nonlinear equations and determine the best possible Lyapunov function fit within the mathematical Language of polynomials. The project will test these algorithms on cluster and parallel graphics processor computing machines and will be able to study nonlinear differential equations with up to 20 states. These algorithms will then be applied to discretized nonlinear partial differential equation representations of the magneto-hydrodynamics of plasma in a nuclear fusion reactor to obtain a function of energy which can then be used to design and test magnetic and radio frequency controllers which will reduce or eliminate magneto hydrodynamic instabilities. The algorithms developed can also be applied to any large nonlinear system, implying they can be used to improve understanding and control in applications such as chemical reactors, gene regulatory networks and communication satellites."

This project will examine processes which drive the dynamic evolution of thin current sheets in the region where the auroras are generated. The dynamic evolution of auroral arcs is responsible for the rapid kinking, curling and folding of auroral forms that make watching the aurora so compelling. These motions are the consequence of the interaction of plasma instabilities in thin current sheets operating on scale sizes from small-scale kinetics up to the size of the full auroral acceleration region. This project will exploit observations from the Reimei spacecraft which provides the first dedicated imaging of auroral forms with magnetically conjugate high time resolution measurements of the particles which drive them. These observations provide the unprecedented opportunity for quantitative analysis of auroral motions and structuring to be performed while simultaneously providing details of the particle distributions driving the optical emissions. The project will implement a new wavelet-based technique for the analysis of sequences of auroral imagery from the Reimei spacecraft to ascertain the vorticity of plasma flows as a function of scale. The distribution of vorticity with current or energy flux (luminosity) will provide the means to identify which processes dominant in the evolution of the auroral structures. The satellite observations will be aided by the use and further development of a 3-D, reduced MHD numerical simulation that includes electron inertia and ionospheric resistivity. Existing statistical field measurements from the FAST spacecraft will be used to augment the Reimei imager and particle observations to provide a more complete characterization electrodynamics of the auroral forms and for comparison with simulation results. <br/><br/>The project will help improve our understanding of a very well known and commonly observed phenomenon of public interest. It involves a collaboration with the Center for Science Education at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory. The results from this research will be incorporated into a series of workshops for teachers who are primarily involved in teaching African-American and Latino students. The project also promotes teaching, training and learning by providing support for a postdoctoral scholar and graduate student researcher."

Numerous AGN launch relativistic twin jets of plasma from the immediate vicinity of their black holes which, when oriented close to the line of sight to the observer, give rise to a class of AGN named blazars. <br/><br/>Observations by the Fermi satellite and ground based imaging Cerenkov telescopes show that many blazars are prodigious sources of gamma-rays at tera-electronvolt (TeV) energies. Their impact on the energetics of the universe, however, has previously been thought to be slim since their luminous output is a minor component of the total radiative power in the universe. However, recent work by the PI and his collaborators suggest that TeV blazars are, in fact, remarkable sources of energy. By studying pair beams (electron-positron pairs that are produced when photons from TeV blazars meet extragalactic background light photons) the PI argues that blazars are the dominant heat source in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts 2-3. This would have substantial implications for the evolution of the universe.<br/><br/>The PI will perform a detailed analysis of the cosmological implications of TeV blazars, which will touch on many different areas of astrophysics: from linear plasma instabilties, to weak turbulence and thermalization, to thermodynamics of the IGM, and to the formation of galaxies and clusters. He will (1) investigate the plasma physics of ultrarelativistic pair beams, (2) set blazar heating in a cosmological context, and (3) explore the implications of his work for the structure formation of the universe.<br/><br/>The PI will disseminate his research to a broad audience in numerous ways. First, he will reimagine introductory physics classes at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), by combining traditional lectures with online video lessons and exercises. He will also work closely with the Astronomy Club at UWM by recruiting undergraduates and high school teachers for semester and summer research projects. Finally, the PI will perform public outreach by producing and giving public lectures through the Astrobreak series at the nearby Manfred Olson planetarium."

A promising treatment option is the protein bioscavenger, human butyrylcholinesterase, (huBChE), which will bind and inhibit these nerve agents. The enzyme can prevent intoxication of humans exposed to OP compounds by binding to the nerve agents and sequestering them from acting on the nerve agent?s principal target of acetylcholinesterase in humans. HuBChE derived from human plasma has shown promising results in limiting OP agent poisoning in animal models, exhibiting a long circulatory half-life (mean residence time) extended over days. Unfortunately, since the supply of human plasma is limited, recombinant protein sources of huBChE are urgently needed to meet the need. Unfortunately, recombinant human BChE (rhuBChE) has not been as effective as plasma-derived natural huBChE, predominantly because the circulatory half-life of rhuBChE can be 10 fold lower due to rapid removal of the protein from the patient?s blood stream. A major reason that rhuBChE is not effective is because current recombinant expression systems do not have the biosynthetic capabilities needed for generating a recombinant product with similar physical and chemical properties as native huBChE. Therefore, the goal of this project is to apply metabolic engineering strategies to modify the production platform of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in order to enhance these cells? post-translational processing capabilities and produce long-lived rhuBChE products. Previous studies with huBChE have shown that two of the critical factors limiting circulatory half-lives are sialic acid content and multimeric protein assembly. In order to increase circulatory half-life of rhuBChE and other therapeutics, CHO cells will be modified to synthesize a recombinant protein that contains increased levels of sialic acid and a greater fraction of assembled tetramers. In order to accomplish these goals, sialyltransferases will be overexpressed, biochemical pathways responsible for generating sialic acid precursors will be enhanced, and the PRAD chaperone facilitating huBChE tetramer assembly will be engineered into CHO cells. The resulting rhuBChE will be purified and its tetrameric assembly status and sialic acid content compared to plasma derived natural huBChE to determine if the physical and chemical properties are similar. <br/><br/>Chinese hamster ovary cells are the most widely used production organism in biotechnology, applied for the production of nearly half of the biotherapeutic proteins available today. This project will transform this important production platform by enabling CHO to generate products with increased circulatory lifetimes. Increased circulatory lifetimes will result in lower dosages for patients taking these drugs and make these biopharma products more affordable in the US and around the world. The enclosed project will demonstrate this capability for the production of the clinically relevant bioscavenger, huBChE, used in treating poisoning by nerve agents present in pesticides and chemical weapons. Furthermore, this new platform will be equally applicable for improving the circulatory lifetimes of many other biopharmaceuticals in the market or clinic. In addition, the project will serve to educate graduate students in critical biotechnology skill sets needed for industry and excite local Baltimore high school students from diverse backgrounds in biotechnology education and careers through hands-on learning modules."

The theoretical framework of the strong force is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), whose fundamental particles are the quarks and gluons. These in turn build up protons and neutrons, which are understood to be the low-energy phase of quarks, bound by the strong nuclear force. At the very high temperatures reached in relativistic heavy ion collisions, the aim of this project to study how protons and neutrons melt into constituent quarks and gluons, which are no longer bound. This high-temperature phase of nuclear matter is called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy-ion experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider have produced striking evidence for QGP formation. The field is moving towards a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of the QGP.<br/><br/>Given this background, the project focuses on the experimental measurement of three distinct thermodynamic properties of this novel state of nuclear matter with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The first property to be measured is the temperature produced in the hottest stages of the collision. This is done via the study of Upsilon mesons, a bound state of heavy ""bottom"" quarks. In the hot, early stage of the collision even heavy-quark bound states, like the Upsilon, are expected to melt in the collision. The group will study the melting pattern of Upsilons and their excited states with STAR and with CMS in proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions. This measurement will provide crucial information to test models of the deconfinement of quarks in the high-temperature QGP. The second goal is to study the thermodynamic phase structure of the strong force. In particular, testing the existence of a predicted QCD critical point is a key component of this goal. This study is done with STAR by varying the collision energy, and thereby exploring the transition between normal nuclear matter and QGP matter. The third goal is to study the density of the medium using events in which a neutral electroweak boson, the Z0, is produced in coincidence with a quark jet. The Z0 is unaffected by the QGP, providing a clean estimate of the transverse momentum of the quark jet. As the partner jet traverses the dense QGP medium and loses energy, these Z0 + quark jet events are one of the best ways to study the energy loss of quarks.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work are aimed at underrepresented minorities and women. The first is to communicate the excitement of high-energy nuclear physics to Latino students at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), through mentoring activities at the conference and support of the UC Davis SACNAS chapter. The second component is promotion of science and physics to elementary and high-school students through visits to elementary schools with large Latino populations, and via participation in the Adopt-A-Physicist program for high schools. Finally, the PIs in the project will mentor undergraduates, including NSF REU students, every year. A key part of these goals is the mentoring of our own graduate students to become leaders in these activities, since many are women and underrepresented minorities, and are therefore excellent role models."

While these lasers have the advantage of their compact size, their use in many applications is still limited by their low average power.<br/>The proposed research is designed to advance table-top soft x-ray lasers into high average power devices , with the goal of ultimately achieving multi-milliwatt average power laser beams in the 60-100 eV photon energy region from a compact device, greatly impacting applications in several fields. We plan to achieve a significant increase in average powers by tailoring the plasma amplifier with an unprecedented level of control to achieve higher efficiency while simultaneously increasing the repetition rate by using a new type of diode-pumped high energy ultra-short pulse laser driver.<br/><br/>Technical: In the present state-of-the-art collisional soft x-ray lasers only several percent of the laser pump energy is deposited in the gain region. Recent experiments and simulations show that relatively minor alterations in the pump energy temporal distribution can result in a large increase in the soft x-ray laser efficiency. We propose to take advantage of this unexploited high sensitivity to significantly increase the efficiency and output power by tailoring the pump energy deposition rate with a high level of control to create a plasma with larger gain and reduced refraction loses. Extensive sets of hydrodynamic/atomic physics simulations and experiments covering a broad range of pump parameters will be conducted to identify the pump pulse sequence that maximizes the soft x-ray laser output energy. The resulting increase in the soft x-ray laser efficiency will be combined with an increase in repetition rate made possible by a novel high energy diode-pumped solid state laser driver. This could result in table-top soft x-ray laser beams with orders of magnitude higher average output powers in the 60-100 eV photon energy region than presently available compact coherent sources. The more efficient pumping will also facilitate the extension of practical soft x-ray lasers to shorter wavelengths.<br/>The transformation of compact soft x-ray lasers into high average power devices can be expected have a broad technology impact in nanoscale imaging, defect-free patterning of materials, and materials characterization. The propose research will provide exciting multi-disciplinary thesis projects for graduate students, with the opportunity of working in both the engineering and the physics of advanced laser systems. The proposed project will also contribute to train a diverse workforce of an area of great industrial interest and economic impact, as the semiconductor industry is approaching the start of the mass production of computer processors using extreme ultraviolet lithography. We plan to use the opportunities offered by the proposed project to involve a diverse group of undergraduates, high school students, and high school teachers in research. We plan to include the participation of high school students in the project during the summers."

Vaccines work by administering a pathogen in a non-infectious form, which allows the animal to develop a pool of B-cells and T-cells with receptors specific for that pathogen. These pathogen-specific immune cells are retained for many years (immunological memory), and upon exposure to the real pathogen, they are ready to effectively combat and neutralize the threat. Mammals actively regulate the vaccine response, allowing only 1-2% of the adaptive immune cells to be specific for any given target. This allows mammals to be protected against many pathogens simultaneously. In contrast, when rainbow trout are vaccinated they direct 40-60%, and in some cases >90%, of their B-cells to the vaccine. This dramatic, and unexpected, response comes at the expense of all other B-cell specificities which are lost from the animal. This ""all-in"" response to vaccination may have long-term consequences for the health of the animal, as memory to other pathogens may have been lost. This project will investigate the B-cell responses in vaccinated rainbow trout across 3 levels of organization (cells, proteins, and genes). We are expecting to find that even though the proteins may have a singular specificity, the genes that encode for the protein will maintain considerable diversity. Discoveries made in this grant may aid in the development of vaccine strategies to improve the health of vaccinated rainbow trout which are grown on farms or released to restock our waterways. The project provides research experiences for high school and undergraduate students, and considerable research training opportunities for graduate students. The project also seeks to foster long-term educational relationships with the local community through numerous outreach initiatives."

This aspect of the program supports the large investment made and being made in astronomical observations worldwide. Other experiments focus on the evolution of nuclear shell structure with increasing neutron number, especially near the magic numbers of 20 and 28. The behavior of nuclei at ultra-high spin will be explored through discrete gamma spectroscopy using arrays of gamma detectors at FSU and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The group will also exploit heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to investigate the characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma. The broader societal impacts of this project lie in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in a hands-on environment. Florida State University has served as one of the leading educators in the field of nuclear physics (4th highest Ph.D. production in the U.S.) and this grant will enable the group to continue to attract and train the best and brightest graduate students in experimental nuclear physics. Because of the students' training and hands-on work with high tech equipment in a forefront nuclear physics laboratory, FSU graduates are in high demand and now serve in key roles in homeland security, national defense, high-tech industry, leading edge research, and STEM education. Finally, these measurements will be important for understanding stellar processes and the abundance of elements in our universe. <br/><br/>A significant part of the proposed research uses short-lived rare nuclear isotopes from the FSU Fox Laboratory to study nuclear reactions and structure in unstable nuclei. This is very important for reactions of astrophysical importance, many of which proceed through unstable nuclei. These beams have low intensity and so will benefit from the ANASEN active target and detector array recently developed by FSU in collaboration with Louisiana State University. A newly developed neutron detector array (RESONEUT) will be used to study (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics with radioactive beams. A series of experiments is planned to measure the critical parameter of lifetime following beta decay of heavy, neutron-rich nuclei on and close to the expected r-process path at TRIUMF. The confrontation of state-of-the-art shell model calculations for multiple cross-shell excitations with proposed nuclear structure measurements will strengthen their reliability for extrapolation to the astrophysically important region. The FSU 14C beam will be used to explore nuclear structure in more neutron-rich nuclei with a recently digitized Germanium detector array. Measurements using gamma detector arrays (GRETINA and GAMMASPHERE) will explore newly proposed exotic shapes and ultra-high-spin structures in the atomic mass ~ 150 region. Other work involves studying the quark-gluon plasma with heavy flavor probes using the PHENIX detector system, parts of which were constructed at FSU.

The network team brings together expertise in high performance computing techniques, astrophysics, and plasma physics in order to address this need. The team will develop a general relativistic, radiation magnetohydrodynamics code to study luminous accreting black holes, and a multi-fluid relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code with anisotropic electron and ion pressures, conduction, viscosity, and radiative heating and cooling to study slowly accreting systems. These new codes will be used to address fundamental questions about the structure and observational appearance of the inner accretion disk as well as the origin and maintenance of the large-scale magnetic fields believed to power relativistic jets, and then will be made publicly available to the research community. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development by supporting the work of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs; and a program of visualizations, released on the internet, will help communicate the excitement of black hole astrophysics to the scientific community and to the broader public."

The study will be based on the hypothesis that ESF originates from large-scale wave structure (LSWS). LSWS is an altitude modulation of isodensity contours in the bottomside layer that grows to large amplitudes. The modulation alters the background conditions that control development of ESF and features such as equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), a behavior that is of considerable interest to space weather. LSWS has been ignored almost completely by researchers for good reasons. Experimentalists have been unaware of its existence, and theorists have not considered it because its importance remained questionable. However, recent observations have shown that LSWS is real, occurs frequently in the evening equatorial layer, and appears to play a substantial role in the day-to-day variability of ESF and EPBs. The objectives of the study are twofold: (1) to extract as much information as possible about LSWS from well-designed experiments, data analysis, and theoretical studies, and (2) to investigate the day-to-day variability problem through a series of tasks that can test the working hypotheses. New paradigms will be constructed following those tests, and that cycle will be repeated throughout the course of the project. The studies will revolve around the analyses of unique databases and new experiments that will take advantage of a unique cluster of instruments, which is capable of extracting the properties of LSWS. The cluster is unique because it can distinguish spatial from temporal variations, and LSWS is essentially a stationary spatial structure during its growth phase. The goal of the project is to obtain a comprehensive description of LSWS, and derive considerable insight about seeding, LSWS amplification, and the development of EPBs. The results will also validate the crucial need for instrument clusters in studies of ESF."

This radar will be supported by a coherent scatter radar imager fielded so as to have common E- and F-region scattering volumes with Arecibo. The project will also utilize the Arecibo lidars and all-sky imagers as well as sounders and GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) data. The theoretical investigation will focus on the turbulence properties of the neutral motions in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region, which will be studied using a multi-scale analysis, and on the consequences for ionospheric structuring.

The scientific scope of this field has broadened significantly with new measurements and theoretical developments. The discussions in this workshop will include an interdisciplinary combination of concepts from elementary-particle physics, nuclear physics, QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and non-equilibrium transport theory.

One of the simplest classes of things that can happen is ""elastic scattering"" in which the electron and the atom do not exchange energy and continue on their way after the collision with the same energies that they had before the collision (but perhaps changing their direction). These are called laser-assisted free-free (LAFF) processes because the electron is free (i.e., not bound to an atom or molecule) both before, and after, the collision. This work will involve experimental LAFF studies, with the broad aim of increasing our basic understanding of these processes. Particular attention will be paid to resolving long-standing discrepancies between theory and experiment (there are several sets of experimental data that have defied theoretical explanation for over twenty years) and examining how two-color laser fields affect, and can be used to control, scattering processes. In addition to the advancement of our basic understanding of scattering processes, this work has applications to a variety of fields, both basic and applied. For example, similar processes are important for understanding the interiors and atmospheres of stars. Free-free transitions also play a major role in the gas breakdown that occurs in electrical discharges, and provide a method for laser heating of a plasma (a gas of ionized atoms). Understanding these processes helps form a more solid scientific foundation for the field of plasma physics which underlies the manufacturing of the microelectronics at the heart of our computers and cell phones. This work will primarily take place at an undergraduate institution, and will directly involve several undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>To accomplish the above stated aims, two different sets of experimental LAFF studies will be performed. The first set of experiments will continue this group's previous work which is well described by theory in spite of the fact that some similar experiments done by another group contradict current theoretical understanding. There are three significant differences between the experiments performed by the two groups: the electron energy, the photon energy, and the photon polarization. The new experiments will investigate a range of incident energies, as well as geometries that have not previously been investigated; e.g., laser propagation direction perpendicular to the scattering plane, and laser polarization direction perpendicular to the scattering plane. Essentially, the experiments will go from perturbative, to non-perturbative regimes. This data will test current theory, as well as provide insight to the development of more complex theoretical descriptions of the LAFF processes. In addition, the new experiments will look for interference effects in LAFF experiments that use a two-color (photon energy = 1.17 eV, and 2.34 eV) laser field. Electrons scattered in such a two-color field that have an energy 2.34 eV below the elastic peak may have emitted either a single 2.34 eV photon or two 1.17 eV photons. The research group will perform experiments that vary the relative phase of these two colors to observe predicted interference effects."

Chemical bonds themselves are electrons shared between atoms and can be thought of as a glue holding the atoms in a molecule together. The electron-glue analogy, however, only goes so far, because a bond can be weakened by both too little and too much glue, and weak bonds can be cleaved during the permanent motion of the atoms. In other words, adding an electron to a molecule generally weakens its bonds, and the resulting so-called temporary anion may undergo either bond cleavage or, alternatively, reemit the extra electron. Concrete examples where this reaction is applied or happens naturally are: plasma chemistry and plasma etching, chemistry in the ionosphere, damage to living tissue by ionizing radiation, cancer therapy with electron beams, and reduction reactions with solvated electrons, the so-called Birch reduction. This research project supports the development of computer models of the temporary anion, the first intermediate formed in these electron-induced reactions. This research is carried out with collaborators and with undergraduate researchers. In order to introduce undergraduates to this research, Dr. Sommerfeld also designs educational mini-projects, which are only indirectly related to the current main project, but can be addressed with standard quantum chemistry methods, so that his students can be introduced to the research area step-by-step. <br/><br/>In this project Dr. Sommerfeld studies electronically metastable states - so called resonance states or, simply, resonances. On the one hand, he develops ab initio methods to characterize resonances, and on the other hand he applies the newly developed methods in selected applications. Computing both the energy and finite lifetime of a resonance is still a notoriously challenging task for quantum chemistry, because it combines an electron-scattering with an electron-correlation problem. To address the continuum aspect, Dr. Sommerfeld either uses complex-absorbing-potentials or the analytic-continuation-in-the-coupling-constant method. To address the correlation aspect, he uses the symmetry-adapted-cluster configuration-interaction method, an electronic structure method closely related to the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method. One particular point of emphasis is the artificial stabilizing potential added to the Hamiltonian in the analytic-continuation-in-the-coupling-constant method. Dr. Sommerfeld aims to identify a short-range stabilizing potential that improves the subsequent analytic-continuation step. On the application side Dr. Sommerfeld's goals are to examine resonance states, which differ in electronic structure from a closed-shell neutral either by one-hole (Auger-like resonances) or by one excitation (e.g. Penning ionization or resonant photodetachment). For these resonances, treating electron correlation in a balanced way is particularly challenging. Dr. Sommerfeld studies temporary anion resonances embedded in small molecule clusters with the goal of identifying trends in the change of the resonance parameters associated with the interaction strength (permanent dipole, higher order multipoles, dispersion) of the embedding molecules."

A computational approach will be used to collate data performed under a large number of environmental and genetic perturbations. These network based computational methods of clustering large datasets are aimed at obtaining a more global picture of the protein kinase based signaling pathways. Overall, these experiments will identify networks of key growth regulating signaling pathways, as well as reveal important new insights on the molecular mechanism by which cells expand."

Glutamate is one such molecule, which is not only an amino acid needed for the synthesis of proteins, but also the most important neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, responsible for the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Glutamate is transported across the plasma membrane through active glutamate transporters, which play essential roles in controlling the levels of glutamate in the mammalian brain and other tissue. This project explores the fundamental principles by which these transporters work. Understanding these principles is important because it will contribute to our knowledge not only of the role of glutamate and nutrient movement between cellular compartments in the mammalian brain, as well as other organs of the body, but also glutamate homeostasis, which is important for cellular function in general. Furthermore, the developed methods for analyzing transport will be applicable to potential future studies of other neurotransmitter and/or nutrient transporters and membrane proteins. On the educational level, the project provides an invaluable opportunity for undergraduate students to become involved in cutting-edge biophysical research, providing training in basic physical, quantitative approaches to be applied to a significant biological problem. The investigator is continuing previous efforts of undergraduate involvement (including members of under-represented groups), which has led to many publications with undergraduate students as co-authors, as well as students successfully moving on to careers in research. The investigator is also very active in local and regional activities that promote the sciences at all levels, including demonstrations at schools, science fair involvement, and assuming leadership roles in the local American Chemical Society (ACS) section and the Science Olympiad. Such activities are necessary to ensure a vibrant local science community and to foster excitement of the upcoming generations of young scientists for science and research. <br/><br/>Active glutamate transport is a multi-step process that requires multiple ion/substrate binding steps, as well as conformational changes. Despite recent progress towards understanding the transport process through functional studies, as well as the identification of structural models of a bacterial homologue of mammalian glutamate transporters in several states, basic questions about the mechanism, specificity, and dynamics of interaction of the transporters with cations, in particular K+ and Li+, as well as the energetic contributions to energy barriers that control the transport rate and specific structural changes in the transport cycle remain unresolved. Answers to these questions are obtained by applying a combination of experimental and computational methods, allowing the investigation of the dynamics of glutamate transport in real time, with microsecond time resolution, and to test predictions from all-atom and simplified molecular models. This work has the potential to reveal new aspects of glutamate movement across the cellular membrane, in particular with respect to the cooperation of polar and non-polar forces, which are fine tuned to adjust the energy barriers associated with ion/substrate binding, as well as conformational changes. The novel insight may uncover more general concepts that are employed by membrane transport proteins, in order to provide a permeation pathway for polar molecules across the hydrophobic membrane."

However, despite all the efforts devoted to investigating the SSW, two fundamental questions about this type of wind remain unanswered: (1) where does the SSW originate in the corona; and, (2) how do the coronal plasma properties determine the in-situ heavy ion composition of the SSW? This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at characterizing the coronal origins of the SSW in order to answer these two important science questions. The project team will study the SSW, utilizing two completely different techniques: in-situ measurements of local wind plasma properties, and remote-sensing spectral or imaging observations. When combined together, these two techniques can become a formidable tool that allows the investigators to fully exploit their potential to study the origin of the SSW. This project will benefit the solar research community and serve important educational functions. By using two completely different measurement techniques, this project will serve as a bridge between two different solar physics communities that have been working in parallel with limited interaction: the in-situ community and the remote sensing community, and will thus stimulate a new wave of cross collaborations. The research will be carried out at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where it will support undergraduate education through the University's UROP program and graduate education through collaboration with the graduate students in our department.

The in-situ solar wind observations will be classified based on their coronal origin types rather then their in-situ properties. Back-tracking methods will be used to identify the corresponding source regions on the Sun. The physical properties of the solar wind source regions will be determined using spectral line intensities. This research project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the origin of the solar wind.

Galactic winds are a key component of this exchange of matter and energy. This project aims to study the initiation and propagation of galactic winds with particular focus on the role of particles moving at speeds near the speed of light. Such particles are known as cosmic rays. (In fact, such cosmic rays from our own Milky Way Galaxy interact with each of us every day!) The major outcome of this project will be improved and extended models of galactic winds (1) that build insight into the nature of galactic winds, (2) that can be used by astronomers to connect galaxy and cosmic ray properties with wind properties, and (3) that can be adapted to advanced computer simulations of how galaxies form and change throughout their lifetimes. This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training graduate and undergraduate students in plasma and computational physics and by using the project results to develop teaching materials for university courses. In addition, the investigators will develop a new public outreach program, ""The Sun in the Park,"" that will offer solar viewing and participatory exercises in urban parks in Madison and Milwaukee.<br/><br/>More technically, winds are detected from galaxies of many types. Simulations of galaxy formation and evolution have shown that star formation must be limited by feedback processes and that galactic winds driven by stellar energy and momentum output may be a key part of this feedback. Radio and gamma-ray probes of cosmic rays in a variety of galactic environments have greatly extended our knowledge of cosmic ray properties and those of the underlying galaxies. Although cosmic rays account for a small fraction of the energy output from stars, they have an outsized role in driving galactic winds through their high mobility, long cooling times, and strong coupling to the background through plasma waves. This project will investigate the basis for this coupling in a variety of interstellar environments. This part of the work will address whether cosmic rays couple efficiently to both fully and weakly ionized outflows, how small scale interstellar turbulence affects momentum and energy transfer, and how extreme conditions including high gas densities and weak magnetic fields affect the coupling. The investigators will create a versatile grid of outflow models based on a small number of parameters to aid in interpreting observations of winds and implementing them in galaxy simulations. They will use this work as a basis for improved treatments of cosmic rays in collaborative advanced numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution."

As these integrators are based on mechanical principles, they inherit, at the computational level, the variational nature of most mechanical systems, from particle mechanics to continuum mechanics, with surprising efficiency and robustness, and with arbitrary accuracy. Our research goal is to further develop this technique and introduce an entirely new class of Eulerian-based variational integrators of partial differential equations. By design, our geometry-based time integrators will exhibit all of the classic hallmarks of variational integrators. Consequently our research, containing intertwined theoretical and practical components, is aimed at producing simple and predictive simulation tools for a wide range of phenomena in fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, and reactive CFD.<br/><br/>While the idea of discretizing variational formulations of mechanics is standard for elliptic problems, only recently was it used to derive variational time-stepping algorithms for mechanical systems. We wish to leverage the large body of literature on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian principles in mechanics to develop discrete, Eulerian-based variational integrators and further extend the realm of geometric mechanical integrators developed over the past few years. The computational and mathematical foundations sought after, along with the resulting integrators, will provide fresh insight in understanding the fundamental role of discretization and numerics in Eulerian simulations. These new computational tools will consequently advance the state-of-the-art in a wide range of challenging physical problems such as magnetohydronamics, plasma physics, charged, and complex fluids. Our team, with existing strengths in multidisciplinary computational projects and academic-industry collaborations, will develop an innovative curriculum in mathematical computing to train future scientists in theoretical and computational matters. Besides providing a stepping stone for our long-term research goal of solving complex, multiscale physical phenomena, the synergetic mixture of mechanics and geometric objects in this project promises to be a rich source of fundamental and computationally important methods, as well as interdisciplinary interactions between physical sciences, mathematics, and information technology."

The project's high-resolution studies of flaring and active regions at long radio wavelengths should provide information that is potentially useful for space weather predictions. Studies of the solar corona at eclipses have been a major part of the success of the Williams College department in attracting and training students. Undergraduate students, increasingly including members of underrepresented groups through Williams' need-blind admissions policy, have been intimately connected with the eclipse expeditions in the past and the associated data reduction and analysis. This project would enable the active involvement and training of students at the Williams College to continue. Furthermore, since total solar eclipses are of widespread public interest in the countries from which they are visible, they provide an excellent opportunity for public education in the United States about astronomy in general. Therefore, this project directly supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>This 3-year project is to take advantage of the 21 August 2017 total solar eclipse, especially to observe the white-light corona and work with highly processed images that bring out detail and extreme contrast, allowing improved measurements of dynamics of coronal plumes and other coronal features, especially coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and to observe the green-line (Fe XIV), and red-line (Fe X) coronas to contrast regions of different temperatures. The solar observations include exquisitely high resolution observations with a Fabry-Perot. Also, high-frequency (>1 Hz) power spectra of coronal loops will be used to compare mechanisms of coronal heating. Spectrographic observations will allow the project team to investigate changes of the spectral-line ratios over the solar-activity cycle as the cycle, now past a low maximum, declines toward.

The overarching goal of this research project is to develop novel species measurement technique to characterize fundamental physical and chemical processes in harsh environments such as those present in modern gas turbine combustor and IC engines. The new techniques developed here have the potential to uncover quantitative, spatially and temporally resolved key intermediate species measurements in reacting flow systems by using the latest developments in the ultrashort pulse laser technology. In addition to primary research outcomes, graduate and undergraduate students including minorities and underrepresented groups are trained in unique, next-generation laser fundamentals and applications. Students work in multidisciplinary research environments and often interact with outside research teams, preparing them for successful future careers in optics and energy related technologies. Research findings will be incorporated into ongoing curriculum and course development work as well as our outreach activities for K-12 STEM groups, further enhancing the broader impacts of this effort. <br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to develop an ultrafast-laser-based optical diagnostic technique capable of measuring chemical species-with initial focus on highly reactive atomic species-in harsh environments without taking in to account complex quenching processes that limit the precision and accuracy of such measurements. Space and time varying concentrations of quenching partners are virtually impossible to quantify in such turbulent flow fields. Furthermore, temperature- and pressure-dependent species-specific quenching cross section data needed for corrections are rather limited and virtually impossible to obtain in many practical situations. In recent years, significant advances have been made in femtosecond-laser-based diagnostic tools for high-repetition-rate imaging of atomic and molecular species in flames and plasmas. However, molecular quenching effects have still prevailed in these diagnostics. In the present work, innovative new nonlinear optical techniques are investigated to elevate such diagnostics to the next level by measuring important atomic and molecular species without the need of quenching corrections. The new diagnostics will be evaluated in high-pressure conditions as well and complex reacting turbulent flow conditions. Subsequently, they will be used to generate critical data sets for chemical kinetics model validation in a selected set of turbulent flames and to characterize a new type of 'wall-less' reactor designed for chemical kinetics studies."

One method of communication involves the direct flow of information through membrane channels that are clustered on the surface of adjacent cells. These clusters of channels are called gap junction plaques and they are composed of proteins called connexin. The removal of gap junction plaques, from the cell surface, is critical to maintaining cell-to-cell communication and impacts numerous cellular functions, including proliferation, cell migration and differentiation. This project will elucidate the needed steps in gap junction plaque removal and determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Increased information on annular gap junction processing and degradation could facilitate the development of new techniques to influence and control cell behavior, including proliferation and hormonal response. The PI will also continue to serve as a resource for the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting professors from minority institutions. She used past NSF research funding to train forty-five undergraduates, eight graduate students, three postdoctoral fellows, seven visiting professors from minority institutions, five high school students, and ten medical students. Most of the students participating in this research over the years have been African-Americans, a severely under-represented group in science. She will also continue her broader outreach through publications, seminars, lectures and workshops for the scientific community and a unique outreach to the general public through art displays and lectures at a local art museum.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the mechanisms regulating annular gap junction processing. The PI hypothesizes that protein kinases via phosphorylation of sites on the C-terminal tail of the gap junction channel protein, connexin 43 (Cx43), play a pivotal role in annular gap junction vesicle processing needed for degradation. Such processing involves annular gap junction fissions as well as the formation of autophagasomes and multivesicular endosomes. Adrenal cortical cell populations will be used to elucidate the role of kinase-mediated Cx43 phosphorylation in annular gap junction processing and degradation. The approach will be to manipulate three kinases [protein kinase C (PKC), Src, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)] known to phosphorylate Cx43 and thought to be involved in annular gap junction degradation. In Objective I, To Measure the Annular Gap Junction Vesicle Degradative Process in Cell Populations in Which PKA, PKC, and Src Activities Have Been Altered. Three complementary methodologies will be used to selectively decrease or increase protein kinase activity: 1) chemical treatments with a panel of agents; 2) knockdown (siRNA) protocols; and 3) infection with replication-defective adenovirus vectors which result in constitutively activated kinases. In Objective II To Measure Annular Gap Junction Vesicle Degradative Process in Cells in Which the Cx43 Phosphorylation Sites Have Been Altered. Connexin mutation and truncation techniques will be used to modify the region of the intracellular ""tail"" of the Cx43 protein thought to be critical for kinase binding and/or phosphorylation. Throughout this study, annular gap junction processing (fission, formation of autophagasomes and multivesicular endosomes and fusion with other organelles (lysosomes, endosomes and plasma membranes [possible recycling of Cx43 to the plasma membrane]) will be investigated with immunocytochemical, quantum dot immuno-electron microscopy, western blot, and time lapse image analysis. Phospho-specific antibodies against the targeted sites are available and will be used to image the spacial and temporal distribution as well as protein amounts of the differing Cx43phosphoforms.The laboratory will continue to serve as a resource for the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting professors from minority institutions. Students will be given a specific project and they will be encouraged to write and present their findings, both to the scientific community and to the general public. The PI will continue to make an impact on the scientific community through publications, seminars, lectures and workshops presented both nationally and internationally. In addition, lectures and installation art displays created, by the PI and displayed at a local art museum, will enable the PI to teach the general public about dynamic cellular events. It is hoped that information gained from this study and the training provided will serve to advance science and thus contribute to public welfare."

The dynamic auroras that appear in the polar regions are visual indicators of energy flowing into the atmosphere from disturbances raging in near-Earth space. Electrons and ions, that power the auroral emissions, travel down magnetic field lines from these disturbances and must be further accelerated along the way. For several decades, the majority of the acceleration was thought to be the result of electrons and ions traversing quasi-static potential drops while moving down magnetic field lines. These potential drops are created when two parallel oppositely-charged layers form in the plasma setting up an electric field and an associated voltage drop. The auroral electrons are accelerated through the voltage drop creating a single energy peak. Recently the significance of time dependent acceleration of electrons by kinetic Alfven waves has become clear. Kinetic Alfven waves are formed under certain circumstances when Alfven waves (traveling along the magnetic field communicating the effects of changes elsewhere in the field) develop an electric field parallel to the background magnetic field. In contrast to the previous mechanism, the parallel wave electric fields accelerate electrons over a broad energy range. However, neither of these processes is well understood. To complicate things, both processes are influenced by coupling and feedbacks with the ionosphere. The PI has developed a compelling new theory that the two processes are related (i.e., that kinetic Alfven waves transition to a quasi-steady state forming parallel potential drops). The focus here is on testing this theory. Broader impacts of the work include the training of a graduate student and communication of results through public outreach. The research is expected to be of broad interest to other plasma physics communities. In the longer-term, it will contribute to better understanding of the space environment, resulting in improved forecasts, and the development of efficient mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable technologies of value to society. <br/><br/>The approach combines theory and modeling with the goal of including a large range of temporal and spatial scales involved in the transition from time-dependent to quasi-steady conditions, a large parameter range, feedbacks through ionospheric reflection of the Alfven waves and by modifications of the ionospheric conductivity due to the precipitating electrons, as well as by the formation and effects of density cavities along the auroral field lines. The primary tool is an already developed linearized two-fluid model, which will be modified to include: nonlinear electron dynamics along the magnetic field line and a realistic dipole magnetic field geometry. This model combined with a kinetic electron model will be used to investigate the acceleration of electrons and their self-consistent interactions with the kinetic Alfven waves."

As the Universe expanded and cooled, these fundamental particles, called quarks and gluons, condensed into protons and neutrons, which eventually combined into nuclei that captured electrons to form atoms. Nearly everything we can observe is made from this fundamental material. Using large particle accelerators, scientists are recreating the conditions at the birth of the Universe in the laboratory by colliding gold or lead atoms at very high energies to study the properties and interactions among these particles. These investigations will provide us with clues to the deeper nature of the fundamental forces in the Universe.<br/><br/>One of the most important discoveries to come from such experiments is that the dense matter created in these collisions is opaque to very high energy quarks and gluons produced in them. These ""partons"" suffer tremendous energy loss as they make their way out of the collision zone, depositing a large fraction of their initial energy in the medium. The strength of the energy loss is directly related to the density of the medium and varies according to the type of parton. It appears that the heavier the parton, the more energy loss it suffers. Energetic partons fragment into a spray of particles called a ""jet"". If a jet contains a high energy electron, there is a very high probability that it originated from a heavy quark. The energy loss of these electron-jets can be used to investigate the properties of the quark gluon plasma medium through which it passed. The goal of this research is to disentangle the energy loss of quarks and gluons by isolating jets containing electrons and comparing their energy loss patterns to those without electrons.<br/><br/>The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland collides nuclei at the highest energies ever created in a laboratory. This RUI project will utilize the ALICE experiment to explore the properties of the quark-gluon plasma using the energy loss of heavy quark jets as a probe. Undergraduate students working on this experiment will be trained in the most advanced data collection, reduction and analysis techniques at the cutting edge of high energy nuclear physics. They will be able to apply these skills in a wide variety of careers, whether they choose to pursue an advanced degree in basic science or not. Their contributions will also help us develop new understanding of the fundamental interactions among the basic building blocks of matter, leading to a deeper understanding of the Universe we inhabit."

Among the important mathematical issues are the rigorous derivation of such models from fundamental physical laws, and the precise study of special types of coherent wave solutions (variously referred to as solitary waves, kinks, vortices, and monopoles, and blow-up profiles). In the last decade, new techniques from several branches of mathematics, specifically harmonic analysis, spectral theory, and Hamiltonian mechanics, have led to striking developments and the resolution of many problems once deemed intractable. The PI has outlined several conjectures that he and his students and collaborators will address by adapting and extending these new methods. At the same time, the resolution of these conjectures is expected to extend the applicability of these methods and interface other branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>First, several conjectures on the derivation of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) as a limit of the fundamental quantum mechanical model for a many-body system of bosons are outlined. The PI will continue to investigate problems pertaining to dimensional reduction by the imposition of strong anisotropic confining, and allowing attractive interactions leading to the focusing NLS, which supports bright solitary wave solutions, as observed in recent experiments. Second, problems pertaining to the geometrical structure of singularity formation for NLS are proposed. In particular, the PI will consider the stability of new contracting sphere blow-up solutions, the possibility for blow-up on an ellipse, and a precise description of blow-up in the Zakharov system, a model for collapse of Langmuir waves in a plasma. Third, the PI proposes to consider the dynamics of dark solitons, vortices, and monopoles, which are solutions for which the wave function has nontrivial topological structure on the spatial boundary, in equations such as the sine Gordon equation, subjected to semiclassical perturbations.

The Principal Investigator of this proposal will be assisted by a graduate student in carrying out this research protocol. <br/><br/><br/> These are waves in the Pc 5 frequency range for which there are oscillations along the direction of the background magnetic field. Three mechanisms have been proposed for these waves: drift mirror instabilities due to pressure anisotropies, drift bounce instabilities and injection of blobs of plasma sheet plasma into the inner magnetosphere. The combination of THEMIS observations near the equator and Cluster observations in polar orbit now makes it possible to determine which of these mechanisms are operating. <br/> The following questions have been identified for study: <br/>1. What mechanism generates compressional pulsations in the dawn and dusk magnetosphere? <br/>2. What are the characteristics of the compressional pulsations, including their spatial extent and latitudinal structure? <br/>3. What mechanism generates the subcategory of compressional waves exhibiting frequency doubling (the frequency of the compression component of the waves is twice that of the transverse components) and how do suprathermal particles respond to the pulsations?"

The PI's goals specifically involve studying how shocks form and evolve in the heliosphere, how plasma flows in sheets behave, which mechanism(s) accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs), identifying the probable sources of shocks, how shocks propagate in the structured solar wind, what causes the observed variability in heliospheric particle composition, and what determines the structure of solar, coronal, and heliospheric magnetic fields.<br/><br/>Shocks are present everywhere in the solar system, from close to the Sun to the outer edges of the solar system. They are believed to accelerate particles to extremely high energies (as in SEPs), which are a major space weather hazard and pose serious concerns for the design and operation of both manned and unmanned space missions. The PI's study of the nature of shocks and how they evolve as they propagate from the Sun to the Earth will provide improved space weather forecasting capability. The PI will also develop an innovative workshop program for mentoring young women in space science, which promises to encourage greater involvement of this underrepresented group."

Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union that are designed to provide opportunities for detailed scientific discussion that is not possible at large meetings such as the Fall AGU meeting. This funding will be used mainly for U.S. students and young researchers but may be used for invited speakers if necessary. New knowledge has been accumulating over the sixteen years since the last Chapman conference on this topic due to progress in observations and global models. The timing is appropriate to bring together researchers to develop a clearer understanding of the state of the field, the open questions, the needed new observations and the capabilities in global models. This conference will enable U.S. students and early career scientists to meet and network with international experts. The conference monograph will provide an up-date look at the state of the research and at the outstanding unsolved questions, which is valuable for both research and education purposes. <br/><br/>Electric currents in space, the focus of the conference, are key to the plasma and magnetic field structures that develop in near-Earth space, at the Sun, at other planets, and in astrophysical objects. The conference has three objectives, namely: (1) to deepen understanding of electric currents in space plasmas, (2) to leverage new multi-satellite data sets, new and expanded ground-based facilities and next-generation global models that were not available during the previous conference on this topic in 1999, and (3) to enrich the discussion by fostering an interaction between researchers who study currents in vastly different space environments (i.e., the Sun, planets and Earth). The observations, models and researchers are inherently international. Attendance is anticipated to be 120-140 scientists."

Key proteins at the cell surface need to be able to transiently interact with each other when they encounter specific stimuli to trigger a response within the cell. How do the signaling partners find each other in a sea of membrane lipids? A mechanism that cells use to confine membrane proteins to specific domains in a continuous membrane is the expression of proteins that are able to establish protein networks or webs. Tetraspanins are evolutionarily-conserved proteins that facilitate the formation of protein networks and establish signaling modules involved in intercellular communication, cell proliferation, development, and specific responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli. However, there is very little experimental data on their exact molecular mechanisms and what physiological roles they play in plants. This project will analyze the function of tetraspanin and tetraspanin-like proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand their molecular and physiological roles in vascular development, cell proliferation, and responses to phytohormones. <br/><br/>The researcher and her group have identified a plant-specific protein family that shares key structural and functional similarities with tetraspanins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, one member of this family named VASCULAR COMPLEXITY AND CONECTIVITY (VCC) controls vascular development. VCC interacts with TETRASPANIN 1 (TET1) and other signaling molecules involved in vasculature development and localizes to the plasma membrane. The researcher proposes that tetraspanins, VCC proteins, and likely other membrane associated proteins act in a combinatorial manner to establish protein-network modules that contain different associations of receptors and signaling components specific to different plant cell types/tissues. In this context, the evolution of plant tetraspanin-like proteins like the VCC family could have potentially increased the diversity and specificity of protein signaling modules on membranes. This project will analyze two plant tetraspanin signaling modules involved in very different processes. One module is at the plasma membrane, consists of TET1, VCC, and the membrane-associated protein OCTOPUS (OPS), and positively regulates vascular differentiation in Arabidopsis embryos. The other module localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, contains TET6, and controls seed longevity, seed responses to abscisic acid and oxidative stress during germination. The goals are to identify what other structuring components (other tetraspanins, VCC, or other TET-like proteins) and signaling molecules (e.g. receptors) are part of these signaling modules, to determine what signaling/physiological events they control, and to explore the function and composition of other tetraspanins and VCC protein networks in Arabidopsis though genetic, proteomic, and molecular approaches. This project will provide interdisciplinary training to a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student, and several undergraduate researchers enrolled in UW-Madison or attending its summer REU program through the Integrated Biological Sciences Summer Research Program. The proposed research will also impact classroom education at the University of Wisconsin. The Principal Investigator teaches three hands-on undergraduate and graduate courses that require the completion of a research project in plant biology. In addition, thirty students taking the Introduction to Engineering Design course at the UW-Madison campus, will interact with the research team on this poroject and design a device specially optimized to facilitate the imaging of plant membrane proteins in intact Arabidopsis embryos and seedlings under controlled environmental conditions."

Additive manufacturing involves the building up of a three-dimensional object by direct-writing or printing of a digitally designed object. Subtractive manufacturing uses etching and other processes to remove solid material from a bulk sample. However, extension of these approaches to the nanoscale and in a high-throughput manner is challenging. This award supports an entirely different strategy for surface texturing at the nanoscale?monolithic nanofabrication?by first creating a thin layer on a thermo-polymer with plasma gases and then relieving the strain in the system. Since surface nanotextures form spontaneously across the entire surface upon compression, the technique is massively parallel. Key advantages of monolithic nanofabrication include simplicity and scalability especially since the polymer substrates (without nanopatterns) are already in use on shrink-wrapped buses. Large-area, hierarchical nanotextures in functional materials are important in a range of applications, including self-cleaning windows, water collection, photovoltaics, bio-fouling, and reduced friction and drag. This research is multi-disciplinary and involves the disciplines of manufacturing, mechanics, chemistry, and materials science. Products of monolithic nanofabrication will be integrated in nanopatterning modules for high school students within the NSF Materials World Network framework, in hands-on activities for public outreach events on nanomanufacturing, and in freshmen chemistry labs on polymers and surface hydrophobicity.<br/><br/>The development of monolithic nanofabrication will open new approaches to control disorder at the nanoscale and the microscale. Most large-area nanopatterning methods aim to produce periodic structures at ever smaller length scales. Well-ordered patterns are often not necessary, however, for an increasing range of applications. This work aims to manipulate local and long-range nanoscale disorder simultaneously on a single substrate thus making hierarchical nanotextures and hence enable unconventional applications. The major nanomanufacturing processing outcomes of this project are: (1) determining parameters to observe nano-fold and self-similar wrinkle formation; and (2) demonstrating how an all-chemical treatment of thermoplastics can generate a tunable mix of ordered and disordered nanopatterns. The major product outcomes include: (1) substrates with in-plane nanotextures with three or more wrinkle wavelengths; (2) nanotextured substrates with control over ordered and disordered regions; and (3) hierarchical nanotextures in functional materials. This platform is well-suited to extract the fundamental principles of how plasma gases react with soft materials to produce local nano-wrinkling. The scalability of the spontaneous texturing process and commercial availability of thermoplastics make monolithic nanofabrication a practical nanomanufacturing strategy."

By comparing information of numerical model and from HF observations the investigators will be able to make conclusions about simultaneous occurrences of irregularities in the ionospheric plasma and gravity waves."

In the past decade, consensus has grown around the importance of cholesterol for supramolecular lateral organization within this system. Today, cholesterol is recognized as crucial in the lateral organization of these membranes in both in vitro (lipid monolayers and bilayers) and in vivo (plasma cell membrane) systems. In Langmuir monolayers containing cholesterol and phospholipids the observed phase separation has been shown to be the result of a competition between long-range electrostatic forces and line tension in two dimensions. However, important questions remain regarding the true equilibrium nature of these systems, the size distribution of their domains, and the role of cholesterol's molecular structure in the observed phase separation. This project will test the hypothesis that the morphology of phase separated lipid monolayers containing cholesterol can be controlled by transition kinetics, monolayer composition, and sterol structure to enable the patterning of solid substrates. Motivation to control lipid membrane patterning comes from the applications of self-assembled lipid systems to the fabrication of biosensors and other biomaterials. Lipid monolayers are regularly used in the fabrication of supported lipid bilayers on solid substrates. Additionally, this project will explore the use of phase separated lipid monolayers to organize nanoparticles at the air-water interface. Through collaborations and partnerships this project will extend recently developed techniques in model convolution microscopy, new line tension measurement methods, and incorporate a novel micro-fluidic flow cell into a traditional fluorescence microscopy set-up. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS: The scientific objectives of this project will be achieved within the context of research at a primarily undergraduate institution. Providing high quality research experiences to train and encourage undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics has been a central component of the principal investigator's role as an educator and mentor over the past seven years. Consistent with the demographics of Augsburg College, the principal investigator will continue to encourage and recruit participation from NSF-defined underrepresented populations. In addition to close faculty interactions through research, this project will provide students with opportunities to develop their understanding of vocational and career objectives through regular contact with collaborators and practicing scientists. The principal investigator will leverage Augsburg's Office of Undergraduate Research and Graduate Opportunities (URGO) to supplement these experiences through professional training as well as assistance in the application process for fellowships and graduate school. Weekly group meetings provide students with opportunities to build communication skills and confidence. Students will participate in the dissemination of results through presentations at regional and national conferences as well as co-authorship of on peer-reviewed publications. This project will also enrich the undergraduate curriculum at Augsburg College. Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis techniques used in this research will be incorporated into undergraduate laboratory experiences for physics majors in sophomore and senior level courses."

Stomata are microscopic pores each formed by a pair of guard cells that shrink and swell to regulate respiration. Calcium channels in the plasma membrane of these specialized cells play a crucial role in allowing an increase of cytosolic Ca2+, which causes these pores to close thus limiting water loss by the plant. Patterns of cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics encode information that impacts stomatal behavior and controls the specificity and efficiency of gene expression; however, the molecular identity of these Ca2+ channels in plants remains elusive. In addition, molecular mechanisms by which these Ca2+ patterns regulate cellular responses, including gene expression, have yet to be identified. Using Arabidopsis guard cells as a model system, the aim of this project is to investigate how a cellular Ca2+ signal is transduced by molecular components at the single-cell level. In this project, a multidisciplinary approach that includes computational modeling and molecular genetic analysis, will be used to characterize a family of putative Ca2+-permeable channel proteins in the plasma membrane and to analyze how cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics modulates gene expression in guard cells and contributes to the regulation of stomatal behavior. The results of this research will reveal novel molecular components of cellular Ca2+ signaling and provide new insights into Ca2+ dynamics-controlled cellular responses in plants.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Fresh water scarcity is one of the major global problems this century, and 65% of global fresh water is used for agriculture. Plants lose over 95% of their water via transpiration through stomatal pores in the leaf surface. Since cellular calcium plays a key role in the regulation of stomatal behavior, results and knowledge arising from the proposed research will contribute to protecting the environment and to improving agricultural productivity.

The aurora borealis of the northern hemisphere and its twin, the aurora australis of the southern hemisphere, are among the most beautiful and awe-inspiring of natural phenomena. They are a manifestation of the interaction of solar plasma with the Earth's atmosphere, magnetic field, and surface, the combined effect of which is termed space weather. As the aurora is a visible manifestation of space weather, observations of aurora are potentially a means of forecasting its catastrophic extremes. Capitalizing on public curiosity of normally intangible plasma physics, the objective of this project is to create a system for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and redistributing data on the dynamics and evolution of auroral events using crowd-sourced ad hoc Tweets and more purposeful postings from citizen scientists. The current solar maximum is the first since the emergence of the ubiquitous use of social media that has changed - and will continue to change - our interactions with computers and the world. Building on a demonstrated prototype system, the project is poised to take advantage of the approach in 2013-2014 of the maximum in the current 11-year solar activity cycle, with several high activity years following. <br/><br/>The team combines expertise in space weather science, human-computer interface design, and informal science education to realize each of its intertwined goals. <br/>1) For space science, the contribution will be a totally new data source for auroral observations and the potential for real-time, higher-resolution space weather forecasts that are a critical step towards transforming our ability to protect and manage critical infrastructure susceptible to interruption and damage. With crowd-sourced data and user contributions, it is possible to achieve the increased density of high quality data needed for improved predictions. State of the art human-computer interfaces, for data upload, analysis, and interpretation that make participation easy, intuitive, and rewarding, will be developed to ensure the high quality data critical to forecasting.<br/>2) For the field of human-centered computing, the creation of new frameworks will transform our understanding of how the emergent processes of crowd-sourced knowledge and labor come together for scientific discovery under the structures of networked computer platforms. Specifically, the stickiest problem in making crowd-sourced media actionable is the verification of the messages received at a high enough tolerance level for organizational decision-making. A transformative approach will be adopted, employing verification techniques within a community of active participants who will also engage the data, offering human intelligence in collaboration with machine intelligence.<br/>3) The education approach is innovative and potentially transformative in its use of social media to explore the beautiful and mysterious aurora, through which participants in a dynamic social network will come to understand the relevance of space weather to their lives. Intellectually engaging resources, research projects, and motivational incentives for participation will help build a community of citizen scientists committed to advancing knowledge of space weather.<br/><br/>This low-cost, citizen science system for improved forecasting of geomagnetic storms has the potential to transform the way space weather prediction is done and considering the enormous potential cost to society of damage due to such storms would be cost-effective. The project will help enhance public understanding of this little known phenomenon so that citizens are aware and prepared to respond to the effects of space weather. Resulting new understanding of effective approaches to citizen science and the impact of human computer interactions on motivations and success at learning will have value to a wealth of other ongoing citizen science programs."

The purpose of the GEM program is to support basic research into the dynamical and structural properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM) with predictive capability.<br/><br/>Reconnection is the process by which stress in the magnetic field of magnetized plasma is reduced by rearrangement of the magnetic field. It is an important process in naturally occurring plasmas found throughout a wide range of astrophysical environments. At the Earth it is the primary physical mechanism for transport of mass, momentum and energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. It is applicable to both the dayside magnetopause and the magnetotail. Studying reconnection is difficult because it involves a wide range of spatial and temporal scale sizes from macroscopic (system wide) to microscopic (the electron inertial length). The only way to include all of the physics of reconnection is to use particle in cell (PIC) simulations and they require vast amounts of computer resources. As a result such simulations have been limited to very simple configurations and have not been used to study phenomena exhaustively. One simplifying approximation that is adopted is to use ion to electron mass ratios less than 1836 (256 is most frequently used now). In essence this means that the electrons are too massive. Recent results have suggested that lighter electrons are more easily magnetized by a guide (along the reconnection line) magnetic field, such that for this case the first adiabatic invariant is conserved. This, in turn, causes a phase-transition to a new regime where large scale electron current layers form in the diffusion layer and these extend to the system size. Even a small (12%) guide field will do this. The purpose of this project is to investigate this new regime. The large scale electron diffusion region is caused by electron pressure anisotropy. This can be accounted for with anisotropic equations of state. Therefore a two fluid simulation code that is much more efficient than a PIC code will be used to study the dynamics of large scale diffusion layers. However, the results from the multi-fluid code will be validated with full PIC simulations. The project will support the participation of a graduate student."

The network team brings together expertise in high performance computing techniques, astrophysics, and plasma physics in order to address this need. The team will develop a general relativistic, radiation magnetohydrodynamics code to study luminous accreting black holes, and a multi-fluid relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code with anisotropic electron and ion pressures, conduction, viscosity, and radiative heating and cooling to study slowly accreting systems. These new codes will be used to address fundamental questions about the structure and observational appearance of the inner accretion disk as well as the origin and maintenance of the large-scale magnetic fields believed to power relativistic jets, and then will be made publicly available to the research community. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development by supporting the work of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs; and a program of visualizations, released on the internet, will help communicate the excitement of black hole astrophysics to the scientific community and to the broader public."

The hot, ionized outer atmosphere of the Sun is a unique laboratory for the study of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasma physics, with ranges of parameters that are inaccessible on the Earth. However, even after many years of investigation, the basic processes responsible for heating the million-degree solar corona and accelerating the solar wind are still not known. One primary reason for this lack of understanding is that the Sun's magnetic field is so topologically complex, with spatial and temporal scales that vary over many orders of magnitude. New observations are revealing heretofore unavailable details, so the related theoretical models must similarly improve in order to have any hope of providing deeper understanding of the physics. This project will use novel combinations of observations and theoretical models to put firm constraints on the connectivity between the rapidly evolving magnetic flux tubes in the solar corona and various types of MHD fluctuations that propagate through them into the heliosphere and dissipate to heat the plasma. The results of this research project will be published in widely available journals and presented at scientific conferences. In addition, the PI will continue developing software tools and databases to encourage and enable others in the solar-heliospheric community to make practical use of these research results.

As critical dimensions approach the 10 nm scale, the need for an Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) method becomes essential. The objective of the proposed research is to establish what atomistic surface modifications produced in several model materials using plasma etching related equipment will enable directional and controlled removal of one atomic layer at a time from those surfaces. The researchers will employ controlled sequential reactions of surface passivation followed by directional low energy ion attack for ""volatile product"" removal to establish for what conditions self-limiting behavior with regard to both the reactive precursors and/or energetic ions/species that are used to remove the products can be established for prototypical materials/etching systems and how such a sequence can enable ALE. The approach includes replacing complex plasma-surface interaction steps by a sequence of individual, self-limiting surface reactions, quantitative, temporally resolved real-time characterization of surface modifications/atomistic thickness changes during processing, development of surface modification/etching models based on complementary vacuum beam studies performed in an ultra-high vacuum system, comparisons with theoretical precursor adsorption/ion-surface interaction models, and industrial studies of the above process parameter space using a variety of plasma reactors and aggressively-scaled semiconductor device structures, along with analytical and electrical characterizations of the impact on the semiconductor device fabrication space.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this work derives from the fact that for anisotropic ALE, ""etch product"" removal must take place in a directional fashion, which is fundamentally different from widely used atomic layer deposition methods, where isotropic reaction(s) provide(s) a conformal coating.

On the other hand, biomimetic systems provide simple platforms for incorporating membrane proteins into biosensing applications. In these applications, membrane proteins are able to sense their local environment, such as the chemical composition and membrane shape, and these factors affect protein function. Until now little attention has been given to the nanoscale structure of these sensors and how nanometer-sized features affect proteins. The main focus of this research is to design biosensors that can be used to identify how cells and biomolecules are affected by nanostructured materials. Specifically, proteins involved with the transmission of neuronal signals and the secretion of hormones will be characterized.

The focus of this CAREER Award is to design two biosensors that will be used to probe the relationship between nanostructured materials and protein function.

The second will provide a template to introduce membrane curvature into live cells, where the molecular response to curvature can be assessed. Both sensors will be used to characterize the relationship between membrane shape and neurotransmission, a biological process that gives rise to extreme changes in membrane topology. Neurotransmission relies on the proper recruitment and function of SNARE proteins to facilitate the fusion of the tethered vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane. SNARE-mediated membrane fusion is essential for membrane repair, growth cone formation, axon extension, and synapse formation. Our work aspires to contribute to the field of neuroregeneration by identifying nanoscale features that drive membrane fusion. By using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques, single particle tracking, and combined confocal fluorescence-atomic force microscopy, principles that govern protein sorting on nanostructured membranes will be identified. These principles will be useful in the future design of biosensors and materials that interface with cells.

This project is laying the groundwork both for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications. Among these is the embryonic development of the wing of a fruit fly and its newly discovered relation to current through potassium channels in the cell membrane. Part of this project is to develop and use sophisticated mathematical techniques to understand that ionic current. The fruit fly model has implications for mammalian development and may lead to an understanding of the cause of some serious birth defects. Applications of the abstract mathematical investigations also include understanding of other dynamical systems subject to random perturbations, including the density distribution in highly excited plasmas or the fine structure of an alloy and how defects are distributed and evolve in time. <br/><br/>This project builds upon the past work of the principal investigators and others to establish the existence of coherent structures embedded in the phase space of complex dynamical systems, both finite- and infinite-dimensional and both deterministic or subject to random forcing. The fundamental and abstract theory to be developed during the course of the project lies behind concrete and observed phenomena in the physical and biological sciences, particularly at the molecular, microscopic, or nano-scale. Infinite-dimensional dynamical systems are required to represent the temporal and spatial fluctuations of quantities subject to physical laws or biochemical processes, such as the distribution of bone morphogenic protein in a developing embryonic fly wing, the current through an ion channel in a cell membrane, the density of a relativistic plasma, or the motion of microscopic defects in an alloy, to name just a few of the systems considered in this project. Furthermore, as complex as these may be, stochastic perturbations must be considered due to thermal or other fluctuations in the environment and imprecise measurement of quantities at small scales. While one cannot hope to give exact representations of all states subject to complex spatial and temporal interaction, one can sometimes glean information due to the presence of robust, but possibly hidden, structures such as invariant manifolds and their invariant foliations whose existence is implied by the laws governing the processes under investigation. The goals of this project are to discover the conditions under which such structures exist, even when stochastically forced, and to examine the implications in the particular physical and biological systems underlying the equations."

Sohn of the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah and Mohamed Khedr fo the Beni-Suef University, Beni Suef, Egypt. They plan to study ""Plasma-Assisted Chemical Vapor Synthesis versus Conventional Synthesis Methods of Advanced Ceramic Nanopowders."" The research techniques will be applied to nanosized ceramic oxide powders which have important applications as advanced materials in many technological areas such as electronics, energy conversion, aircraft, catalysis, and structural materials. Improving the synthetic methods to prepare these materials will promote their cost-effective use in the many applications that rely on attractive properties such as high catalytic and electro-catalytic activity, superior mixing characteristics required for use in a host of applications such as coatings and fillers, enhanced sintering properties, and superior electronic and optical properties.<br/><br/>The Chemical Vapor Synthesis (CVS) process for producing nanoparticles provides unique features that are often difficult to achieve with more conventional synthesis techniques, producing uniformly sized nanoparticles that also possess highly uniform compositions. This project aims to compare the properties of the materials prepared by the plasma vapor synthsis method with materials prepared using conventional methods. The proposed work will apply a plasma reactor to CVS of nanosized oxide powders as well as using an electrical resistance heated furnace. The oxide nanopowders made by the plasma-assisted CVS process will be carefully characterized to determine their properties for a range of applications. In the U.S. partner's laboratory, the CVS method has been applied to the synthesis of metallic and intermetallic fine powders and these results provide confidence that the process can be advantageously applied to the synthesis of useful ceramic powders. <br/><br/>The research will contribute to the increased development of the plasma-assisted chemical vapor synthesis process as an advanced tool for producing many useful materials. The project will also promote the training of young scientists in this field, especially providing training opportunities for underrepresented groups in the U.S. and junior scientists in Egypt. The PI will actively recruit women and other minority students to assist in the performance of the project. Participants from both the U.S. and Egypt will also gain experience on international collaboration by mutual visits and exchange of ideas. The results of the proposed activities is expected to be disseminated broadly through conferences and publications, promoting applications of this technology that will benefit the scientific community and the general public. <br/><br/>This project is funded through the US-Egypt Joint Science and Technology Fund Program. Support for the U.S. side of these cooperative projects is provided to the National Science Foundation by the U.S. Department of State. The Egyptian Government provides support for the Egyptian side of the collaboration."

The singly charged hydrogen molecular ion (two protons, bound together by a single electron) is a simple but fundamental example of such an ion. Diatomic molecular ions are important because they are abundantly found in space, and might also briefly exist in other settings, including living organisms. The mechanism binding the two atoms is very similar to a coiled spring, allowing the atoms to move one with respect to the other without going astray. According to the basics of Quantum Mechanics, a diatomic molecular ion is continually vibrating in a range of discrete quantum states at different temperatures, which are defined by integers that state the degree of vibration on a given scale for which the bigger the integer, the stronger the pulsation. The proposed device probes these discrete states and is comparable to a thermometer reading a low temperature for a cold object and high temperature for hot one. It will also provide data that will help to understand how the vibrational states affect their environment during interaction with other particles. Not well understood, these slow interactions, technically called low energy interactions, are known to play important roles in the interstellar medium, in the cold part of nuclear fusion plasmas, and in the processes of DNA strand breaks, etc. Thus, this project will promote the progress of science and may have implications to a broad spectrum of areas of importance to society; at the same time, it will give participating undergraduate students the opportunity to take part in the development of a sophisticated 3-D imaging device at their own institution.<br/><br/>The charge transfer in collisions between hydrogen and diatomic molecular ions touches a variety of disciplines spreading from physical science to life science. First of all, it is of foremost importance in fundamental physics because it involves the smallest atom. It is also one of the dominant reactions in environments such as the cold divertor plasma regions of a fusion tokamak or in interstellar clouds where the main constituents are neutral H, the positive hydrogen ion, and H-molecules. Moreover, understanding of this simplest fundamental system is a key for mastering more complex systems which exist in, e.g., biophysics where radical attacks on biomolecules such as DNA potentially involve charge transfer at very low energy. However, it is often almost impossible to compare laboratory measured cross sections to existing theories and calculations because the vibrational state distribution of the molecules is not known. The proposed 3-D imaging device will ultimately improve previously measured absolute cross section measurements by making them vibrationally resolved, enabling a more detailed comparison between theoretical and experimental results. In this 3-D imaging technique, the molecular ion undergoes a resonant dissociative charge exchange with an alkali atom and releases its vibrational energy in the form of kinetic energy of the two fragments. The detection of the positions of the daughter particles and their flight time differences made possible with the detectors allows the reconstruction of the molecular ion's initial vibrational energy via simple dynamics. This detection technique is equivalent to taking a time resolved snapshot picture of the molecular ion fragments (thus the name 3-D imaging). The whole 3-D imaging apparatus is envisioned to be a portable device which could be easily transported to and used at a variety of research facilities."

First, the effect of domain geometry is investigated in terms of a relation between the volume growth of the underlying manifold and the decay of linear solutions. The implications of this relation for the nonlinear problem are then explored in certain tractable geometries, namely quotients of Euclidean spaces. Second, the question of small-data scattering (asymptotically linear behavior) for some weakly nonlinear dispersive equations is considered. These are equations where the nonlinearity is not of high enough degree for classical methods to succeed. One focus is on inhomogeneities represented by a potential term, and how this can affect the asymptotic behavior. Finally, the so-called weakly turbulent regime is investigated by studying the long-time behavior of the cubic NLS equation on a compact domain. In this context, a new continuum equation is derived for the envelope of the discrete Fourier modes by taking a suitable large-box limit in the spirit of weak turbulence theory. This equation turns out to enjoy remarkable symmetries and even explicit solutions, and can be used (via rigorous approximation results) to better understand the long-time frequency dynamics of the original NLS system.<br/><br/>The nonlinear dispersive equations considered in this project arise naturally in several areas of physics (plasma physics, nonlinear optics, general relativity, etc.) where they often serve as simplified effective models. In order for these models to be useful for engineering purposes as well, one has to understand the effect of inhomogeneities (usually modeled by a non-Euclidean domain geometry or a potential term) in making connections with the real world. Such a study would help set the parameters and limitations of not only the validity of the existing simplified models, but also the faithfulness of computer simulations (based on those models) in predicting experimental phenomena. On a more theoretical note, starting a mathematically rigorous study of the all-important physical theory of weak turbulence, as suggested in the proposal, represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics, with rewarding applications in plasma and fluid engineering, as well as ocean and atmospheric science."

The broader impacts of the project relate to the retention of students in STEM fields and the participation of minorities in science. To meet these goals recruitment efforts are targeted towards colleges and universities in the South-Eastern United States whose level of research activity is comparatively low or are minority serving institutions. Evaluation of applicants will include a ?need? factor in addition to more traditional assessments of academic preparation. This additional factor enables a keen student from a low research institution, who may have little or no understanding research experience, to compete acceptance into this REU with students from more research intensive schools.

Dr. Arumainayagam has devised probes to study the composition of nanoscale thin films under ultrahigh vacuum conditions before and after irradiation by low-energy electrons or photons. These probes enable his team to observe and characterize the subtle but important chemical changes induced by irradiation. This important category of chemical reactions impacts low-temperature plasmas used in industrially important processes such as plasma etching; use of low-energy electrons instead of photons for highly selective bond dissociations; identification of tracer molecules associated with specific pathways for interstellar synthesis of complex organic molecules (COM); and the relative roles of electrons and photons in atmospheric processes. Involvement of women and minority undergraduate students in this research is planned to promote diversification of the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The work specifically seeks to assess the differences and similarities between reactions initiated by low-energy (< 8 eV) electrons and photons. Target systems include condensed-phase ammonia, water and methanol, each of which is investigated using post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption, post-irradiation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, and isothermal electron/photon-stimulated desorption. Electrons/photons with sub-ionization energies are used to avoid production of low-energy secondary electrons, thereby ensuring that fundamental differences between electron and photon irradiation are probed. Among the objectives of the research are: (i) to measure the effective cross-section for electron/photon-induced reaction and desorption, and to identify all of the electron/photon-induced reaction products; (ii) to study the dependence of the reaction cross-sections and yields on electron/photon fluence, incident electron/photon energy, and film thickness; and (iii) to determine if the products identified by post-irradiation temperature-programmed desorption are nascent radiolysis products. The studies are designed to establish whether electron-induced condensed phase reactions generate unique molecular species; and whether electrons are more effective than photons for initiating specific condensed phase reactions."

The ability to etch such patterns on semiconductors is key to the realization of advanced semiconductor devices. Photonic devices are an important class of such devices; these include high efficiency solar cells, light-emitting diodes, laser diodes and thermal/night vision sensors. The ICP etcher will be operated within a multi-user cleanroom facility that has a demonstrated track record of research excellence, openness and inclusion.

The University of New Mexico is a Hispanic Serving Institution and hence a significant numbers of students from underrepresented groups will benefit from this capability. The ICP will also be used in existing NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and NSF Research Experience for Teachers (RET) programs based at UNM. <br/><br/>The ICP etcher will be able to etch a wide range of III-V semiconductors, including nitrides, phosphides, arsenides and antimonides. Etching can be done controllably and reproducibly by enabling separate optimization of the ion energy, plasma density, and process temperature up to approximately 200 degrees Celsius. The ICP will include a variety of process gases such as SF6, BCL3, He, CH4, H2, Ar, O2, and SiCl4 to offer a broad range of etching capabilities.

Energetic particles are fundamental to the geospace environment. These particles, and their interactions that produce gamma rays, x-rays, and radio emissions, shed light on the fundamental physics of the space environment. In geospace, particles are accelerated by various mechanisms in the magnetosphere, with energies upwards of 10 MeV. Targeted space-based particle injection experiments have enabled scientific investigations of space plasmas since at least the 1950s. However, these controlled experiments were mainly based on relatively low-energy electron beams (<40 keV). Controlled experiments with MeV-class electron beams injected between the magnetosphere and the atmosphere will enable several types of important scientific studies. These include atmospheric-ionospheric-magnetospheric coupling and the response of the atmosphere to long-term geomagnetic forcing; establishing how energetic particles are accelerated, transported, and lost; and understanding the origin and effects of wave-particle interactions. This project has two concurrent objectives: the first is scientific, the other technological. Meeting the scientific objectives will require detailed simulations, modeling, and theoretical calculations of beam-induced instabilities, expansion, and collisions to explore the range of properties of the electron beams. The range of beam properties identified in the science investigation will guide the principal technological objective of this project, which is to define the specifications of the linear accelerators with size, power, and form factors amenable to space deployment and capable of generating the beam characteristics needed to achieve science closure. This study addresses high priority science areas identified by the Heliophysics Decadal Survey and has direct relevance to the science objectives of NASA's Living With a Star, Van Allen Probes mission. The research will also have multiple practical applications. For instance, elucidating how wave-particle interactions cause the radiation belts to lose electrons into the ionosphere will enable technologies for the mitigation of space weather effects. Experiments investigating interactions between relativistic electron beams and the atmosphere will provide a host of diagnostic possibilities for understanding discharges and the modification of chemical reaction paths that will enable technologies to modify nitric oxide (NO) and ozone content in the atmosphere."

Although it is believed that a considerable fraction of the energy in material flowing around pulsars, supernovae, and other strong sources, can be converted into very fast particles, which are identified by the patterns of radiation they give off, the mechanism is not well understood. After this study, the Fermi mechanism will be much better characterized, and may be tightly constrained.<br/><br/>Acceleration of particles in collisionless shocks is at the heart of most models of non-thermal phenomena in the Universe. Observations of synchrotron emission suggest that such shocks in pulsar wind nebulae, in jets from active galactic nuclei, in gamma-ray bursts, and in supernova remnants, can convert a significant fraction of the flow energy into relativistic particles with power-law spectra. However, although it is usually invoked as the cause, the conditions for operation of the first-order Fermi mechanism and its efficiency are not understood from first principles. This project will construct a self-consistent theory of shock acceleration by performing large-scale multidimensional particle-in-cell and hybrid simulations of astrophysical collisionless shocks, and study the microphysics of plasma instabilities, particle scattering, and magnetic field generation, necessary to calibrate nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration theory. Specific questions include: 1) the criteria for existence of shock acceleration, and its efficiency; 2) how accelerated particles influence shock structure and evolution; 3) the proton and electron spectra generated in realistic shocks. The tools developed during this work will enable multi-scale modeling of shocks and will derive particle spectra in the nonlinear regime from first principles. This research will provide predictive power to the hypothesis that Fermi acceleration in collisionless shocks is the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and non-thermal particles, and could place tight constraints on the models of magnetization and on the composition of astrophysical outflows.<br/><br/>Because Fermi acceleration is a fundamental process in astrophysics, the results will be of value to observers, experimentalists, and theorists studying high-energy astrophysical and cosmological sources, and are even applicable to shocks in the solar system. The findings will guide a new generation of laboratory experiments. The work will involve postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate students, training them in numerical modeling and visualization, and thus preparing them for careers in science and technology fields, where large-scale computing increasingly plays an important role. An interactive plasma physics tutorial will be developed to bring intuitive understanding of these thorny subjects to specialists and the general public alike."

In addition, the PI hopes to continue to explore the strongly nonlinear effects relating to frequency cascades in Hamiltonian models on compact domains. The bulk of the project will focus on understanding theoretically the existence and regularity of solutions to strongly nonlinear models, as well as studying local and global dynamics of special solutions within these complex models. However, a component will also consist of using modern functional analytic techniques to study convergence of numerical methods and to study validity of discrete approximations to these models. Such analysis can serve as motivation for dynamics, as well as a means of testing asymptotic limits where direct analysis may no longer predict precise dynamics. In addition, the PI will work to develop a functional analytic framework for studying stability under stochastic perturbations of quasilinear models and computational approximations.<br/><br/><br/>Quasilinear partial differential equations arise in models where curvature has a strong influence on the underlying physics. Hence, surface tension in fluids, surface energy in crystals or relativistic effects in optics can introduce interaction terms that strongly depend upon higher order derivatives of the solution. It is the aim of this project to shed light on in what sense these models have solutions and in particular understand precise asymptotic descriptions of the solutions when possible. Capillary waves might be useful for measuring the surface signature of internal water waves, crystal relaxation plays a role in semiconductor fabrication and ultra-short pulse lasers have appeared in many recent physics applications and plasma generation. From a human resources standpoint, quasilinear problems provide a large pool of problems that can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral. In particular, undergraduates can learn some of the innate difficulties in quasilinear equations by numerically analyzing simple 1,2-dimensional toy-model systems, graduate students can learn the functional analysis framework and develop the techniques through applications to reduced models or critical equations, and postdocs can collaborate on projects to fully explore the models, develop techniques and work towards optimal results in stability theory and phenomenology.

However, the investigators recently discovered a mutant plant with a novel mechanism for enhanced resistance against bacterial pathogens whereby the plant prevents the bacteria from becoming infectious. In this project, the investigators will determine how the mutant uniquely stops the pathogen by studying both the location of and the mechanism(s) controlling this resistance. The investigators will also examine if the mutant has enhanced resistance against other types of pathogens (e.g. fungal pathogens) or if the mutation causes a trade-off of enhanced resistance against one type of pathogen at the expense of increased susceptibility to another. The goal of this project is to determine if there is a novel, genetic means of improving crop survival against pathogens without any unintended penalties.<br/><br/>Most pathogenic bacteria express a type three secretion system (T3SS) to suppress the plant's immune responses, thus allowing the pathogen to acquire nutrients needed to replicate. The investigators recently identified an Arabidopsis mutant (mkp1) that produces less of the chemical signals that induce the T3SS in bacteria, thus resulting in a plant with enhanced resistance. Translating this discovery into improved resistance in the field requires a better understanding of the underlying principles. Does MKP1 regulate levels of transporters controlling movement of metabolites across the plasma membrane (PM) to restrict the chemical signals (addressed by quantitative plasma membrane proteomics)? Does MKP1 regulate the cellular production of these metabolites (addressed by quantitative metabolomics)? Do all cell types in the leaf contribute equally to the production of the metabolites and, therefore, resistance (addressed by cell/tissue-specific complementation? Finally, it is critical to test an informative spectrum of pathogens to determine if resistance in mkp1 extends to other types of pathogens or, perhaps more importantly, if the changes in mkp1 may have negative consequences making it more susceptible to unrelated pathogens. A better understanding of this apparently novel mechanism of resistance may provide an important basis for improving sustainable resistance in the field. The investigators will expand a Plant Biology & Public Policy Workshop they developed for undergraduates where students learn how policy makers at the local, state, and national level affect research at universities. Students will learn to communicate the importance of basic research by providing the most useful information."

This project will thus ultimately contribute to the scientific community's ability to understand and model space weather, which includes disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field that have the potential to damage power grids. In addition, this project will contribute to the training of future scientists by supporting the research team's involvement in, and organization of, the annual Solar Heliospheric and INterplanetary Environment (SHINE) Workshop. This Workshop attracts roughly 200 attendees, of whom approximately 60 are students. The Workshop provides students with specialized training in space science and helps integrate students into the community of space-science researchers. The principal investigator of the project will teach in summer schools for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in the fields of plasma physics and space physics. The principal investigator will also incorporate research findings from this project into his teaching of physics and astronomy at the University of New Hampshire. These activities will contribute to the development of a strong science-technology-engineering-mathematics (STEM) workforce, which will benefit society at large.<br/><br/>The particular scientific focus of the project's turbulence research is on the phenomenon of intermittency and its effects upon solar-wind turbulence. Intermittency is a property of turbulent flows in which random fluctuations in, for example, the velocity of the medium (``eddies'') become concentrated into a decreasing fraction of the volume as the size of the eddies decreases. Intermittency profoundly impacts almost every aspect of solar-wind turbulence, from the rate at which it heats the interplanetary medium to the mechanisms by which turbulent energy is transferred to the different types of charged particles contained in the solar wind. To tackle this problem, the research team will employ a range of methodologies, including mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and they will test their theoretical predictions using spacecraft measurements."

This transition is being studied in ongoing experiments with heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This project will provide theoretical support to these experimental programs by calculating fundamental observables from first principles and systematically relating them to experimental measurements. By taking advantage of the unprecedented level of accuracy achieved in both theory and experiment, this project is expected to advance significantly our understanding of the QGP and will shed light on the nature of the phase transition and the degrees of freedom governing the mechanism of hadronic matter formation. The project will involve students in an international research activity addressing fundamental questions in high energy, nuclear and astrophysics. The PI is actively involved in outreach activities designed to promote physics in Houston schools and she will give public lectures and seminars. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a microscopic understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The methodology employed here is to calculate relevant observables from first principles and map them to experimental measurements through phenomenological models. The specific objectives are as follows: determine the temperatures and densities at which hadrons are formed and relate them to the ones at which hadron yields are fixed by experiments; constrain the existence and position of the critical point at which the order of the phase transition changes; establish whether the interaction is strong enough to enable sequential, possibly flavor specific, hadron formation in the QGP. Besides having immediate applications to RHIC and LHC experiments, the project will also help us understand the nature of matter formation in the early Universe, which might clarify a variety of astrophysical phenomena pertaining to the interiors of stars and the matter distribution in the Universe."

This aspect of the program supports the large investment made and being made in astronomical observations worldwide. Other experiments focus on the evolution of nuclear shell structure with increasing neutron number, especially near the magic numbers of 20 and 28. The behavior of nuclei at ultra-high spin will be explored through discrete gamma spectroscopy using arrays of gamma detectors at FSU and at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The group will also exploit heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) to investigate the characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma. The broader societal impacts of this project lie in the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in a hands-on environment. Florida State University has served as one of the leading educators in the field of nuclear physics (4th highest Ph.D. production in the U.S.) and this grant will enable the group to continue to attract and train the best and brightest graduate students in experimental nuclear physics. Because of the students' training and hands-on work with high tech equipment in a forefront nuclear physics laboratory, FSU graduates are in high demand and now serve in key roles in homeland security, national defense, high-tech industry, leading edge research, and STEM education. Finally, these measurements will be important for understanding stellar processes and the abundance of elements in our universe. <br/><br/>A significant part of the proposed research uses short-lived rare nuclear isotopes from the FSU Fox Laboratory to study nuclear reactions and structure in unstable nuclei. This is very important for reactions of astrophysical importance, many of which proceed through unstable nuclei. These beams have low intensity and so will benefit from the ANASEN active target and detector array recently developed by FSU in collaboration with Louisiana State University. A newly developed neutron detector array (RESONEUT) will be used to study (d,n) reactions in inverse kinematics with radioactive beams. A series of experiments is planned to measure the critical parameter of lifetime following beta decay of heavy, neutron-rich nuclei on and close to the expected r-process path at TRIUMF. The confrontation of state-of-the-art shell model calculations for multiple cross-shell excitations with proposed nuclear structure measurements will strengthen their reliability for extrapolation to the astrophysically important region. The FSU 14C beam will be used to explore nuclear structure in more neutron-rich nuclei with a recently digitized Germanium detector array. Measurements using gamma detector arrays (GRETINA and GAMMASPHERE) will explore newly proposed exotic shapes and ultra-high-spin structures in the atomic mass ~ 150 region. Other work involves studying the quark-gluon plasma with heavy flavor probes using the PHENIX detector system, parts of which were constructed at FSU. In this instance the FSU focus is on the effects of cold nuclear matter on heavy quarkonia production."

This project is laying the groundwork both for the determination of these hidden structures and for analyzing specific situations arising in several applications. Among these is the embryonic development of the wing of a fruit fly and its newly discovered relation to current through potassium channels in the cell membrane. Part of this project is to develop and use sophisticated mathematical techniques to understand that ionic current. The fruit fly model has implications for mammalian development and may lead to an understanding of the cause of some serious birth defects. Applications of the abstract mathematical investigations also include understanding of other dynamical systems subject to random perturbations, including the density distribution in highly excited plasmas or the fine structure of an alloy and how defects are distributed and evolve in time. <br/><br/>This project builds upon the past work of the principal investigators and others to establish the existence of coherent structures embedded in the phase space of complex dynamical systems, both finite- and infinite-dimensional and both deterministic or subject to random forcing. The fundamental and abstract theory to be developed during the course of the project lies behind concrete and observed phenomena in the physical and biological sciences, particularly at the molecular, microscopic, or nano-scale. Infinite-dimensional dynamical systems are required to represent the temporal and spatial fluctuations of quantities subject to physical laws or biochemical processes, such as the distribution of bone morphogenic protein in a developing embryonic fly wing, the current through an ion channel in a cell membrane, the density of a relativistic plasma, or the motion of microscopic defects in an alloy, to name just a few of the systems considered in this project. Furthermore, as complex as these may be, stochastic perturbations must be considered due to thermal or other fluctuations in the environment and imprecise measurement of quantities at small scales. While one cannot hope to give exact representations of all states subject to complex spatial and temporal interaction, one can sometimes glean information due to the presence of robust, but possibly hidden, structures such as invariant manifolds and their invariant foliations whose existence is implied by the laws governing the processes under investigation. The goals of this project are to discover the conditions under which such structures exist, even when stochastically forced, and to examine the implications in the particular physical and biological systems underlying the equations."

It does this by moving an electrical conductor across a magnetic field. This induces an electrical current which creates its own induced magnetic field. The dynamo becomes self-excited when the induced and inducing magnetic fields are the same. A similar self-excited process creates Earth's magnetic field. The associated electric currents flow in the Earth's core, a nearly spherical mass of liquid iron, of radius 2,200 miles, surrounding the Earth's center. Because of this conducting fluid's motion, the Earth's core is a gigantic electric generator, called 'the geodynamo'. A dynamo also needs a power source to maintain its motion and production of electricity despite heat losses through electrical resistance. For the geodynamo the power source is thought to be due to the buoyancy of density differences in the core. The power is expended not only in maintaining the magnetic field but also in overcoming the frictional forces opposing the fluid motion. Current numerical simulations assume that the frictional energy losses are comparable with those from electrical resistance, but it is generally agreed that in reality they are very much less. A dynamo that ignores frictional losses is termed magnetostrophic, and the investigators have recently revived an old idea of the plasma physicist, Bryan Taylor, that has led them to a new numerical procedure through which they have already derived two-dimensional solutions of the magnetostrophic equations. The investigators believe that, when they have made the solutions three-dimensional (a complicated step), they will become the new paradigm for future simulations of magnetic field creation and lead to a better understanding of how the Earth and other planets create their magnetism.<br/><br/>The north-seeking property of the magnetic compass needle shows that the Coriolis force strongly influences core motion. This force is balanced primarily by buoyancy and the Lorentz force, which is the force exerted on a current-carrying conductor by the magnetic field. Taylor showed in 1953 how the resulting simplified dynamical balance could be achieved, so determining the fluid velocity as a functional of the magnetic field. To close the regenerative loop, it is necessary to determine the magnetic field from the fluid velocity, but that is the well-known and well-understood kinematic dynamo process. The way ahead seemed simple in 1953 but all the determined attempts made since then to implement Taylor's suggestion failed, prior to that of the investigating team this year. The model was greatly simplified by assuming symmetry with respect to the Earth's rotation axis. The well-known alpha-effect was invoked as the power source. This also made Cowling's theorem, that otherwise would have ruled out axisymmetric solutions, inapplicable. To convince the dynamo community that this success is meaningful, the team plans to abandon axisymmetry, remove the alpha-effect, and rely on buoyancy to supply the required power. The investigators believe that their results will be an eye-opener for the dynamo community, and will become the basis for models of naturally-occurring dynamos in planets and stars that are more realistic than today's simulations which assume a viscous friction that is very much too large."

The aim of this project is to bridge the gaps that separate scientific communities studying the complex atmospheres of Earth, other solar system planets, and planets around other stars (""exoplanets""). These different systems are united by the same physics and chemistry used by geo-scientists at Earth and by astronomers investigating other planets in our solar system and throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Common themes need common approaches, and results at one location can validate less certain findings elsewhere. This program will create pathways of communication that utilize resources more effectively, promote common modes of data analysis, create all-purpose ionospheric models, and foster student training that removes discipline barriers. The impact of ionospheric disturbances due to Space Weather experienced at Earth (e.g., GPS degradations) will enable parallel studies for Mars, where multiple satellites need reliable communication and navigation for land-based rovers and, ultimately, human exploration. <br/><br/>While the Sun's ultraviolet and x-ray light is the same for all of our planets, the gases present at each location are different, and this leads to a vast set of ions and electrons that comprise the ionosphere at each planet in our Solar System. Even more compartmentalized are studies of ionospheres at planets around other stars. The scientific communities that study them (geophysicists and astronomers) are isolated from each other - programmatically at funding agencies and at professional meetings and societies. This lack of cross-fertilization impedes progress. This award focuses upon the treatment of fundamental atmospheric and space plasma processes as universal - rather than as unique, planet-by-planet, phenomena. The team will develop the first comprehensive archive to host all of the parameters necessary to conduct comparative studies of ionospheres throughout the solar system and beyond, and provide a versatile user-friendly model to do so. The research tools developed will offer many opportunities to resolve important issues in one discipline by applying knowledge and expertise found in other disciplines."

Some of these clouds are harmless while others can penetrate into and disrupt the space environment around Earth in space weather events called geomagnetic storms. Understanding the solar disturbances that produce storms is important because severe space weather can damage satellites orbiting around Earth, endanger astronauts, and even disrupt power grids on the Earth?s surface. Accurate forecasting of strong magnetic storms is hindered by the fact that the features of a coronal mass ejection observed near the Sun do not remain constant but continually evolve as it moves through the background heliosphere on its way to Earth even interacting with other solar disturbances and with large scale magnetic fields and plasma structures in interplanetary space. Major storms have occurred due to changes in the structure of the coronal mass ejection during its propagation to Earth. In an effort to understand and eventually better predict the impacts of coronal mass ejections on the Earth?s space environment, this project takes a detailed look at the changes in the characteristics of coronal mass ejections as they move through the heliosphere, and at the physical mechanisms responsible for those changes, by combining remote-sensing and in-situ observations and comparing to large scale simulations. As an outcome of the project, a large database of events and associated observations will be made available online for the broader scientific community. Results will be disseminated in scientific publications, and through presentations at workshops and conferences. The project supports the training of a post doctoral researcher who will be based at the University of New Hampshire but will spend time working with co-investigators at both NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Naval Research Laboratory. Support of this postdoctoral researcher also serves to broaden the participation of an underrepresented group in a STEM field. In addition, the project will contribute to the training of an undergraduate student each year during the summer months through involvement in high-impact research at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of a suite of satellites currently observing the inner heliosphere with remote-sensing and in-situ instruments to answer fundamental questions about transient solar disturbances (in particular, coronal mass ejections) and how they change during propagation. These satellites include Wind, ACE, Messenger, STEREO, SOHO, and SDO. Remote-sensing instruments view the coronal mass ejection as it lifts off the Sun while in-situ instruments measure its internal structure as it sweeps by on its way outward through the heliosphere. The characteristics of coronal mass ejections are inferred from each type of measurement using previously tested models. A key requirement is a consistent and robust methodology for combining these two very different types of data, which will be applied to some 100 events. As part of the development of the methodology, the discrepancies in the inferred characteristics of the coronal mass ejection from the various data sources will be reconciled. When combined with large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulations a study of the underlying physical mechanisms will be made albeit restricted to a limited number of these cases. Issues to be investigated include: the identification of unclear solar sources, undefined expansion rates, evidence of longitudinal/latitudinal deflections in the propagation, evidence for modifications of the coronal mass ejection due to collisions with solar wind structures or other transient events, and identification of magnetic flux-rope rotations."

Zintl phases are a class of compounds that have already shown significant promise, changing the landscape of energy conversion by doubling the efficiencies of devices made with these materials. This proposal has broader impacts associated with training of the next generation of scientists, enabling them to tackle transforming materials needs over the next several decades. This proposal supports minorities and women at the initial stages (high school to college (ACS SEED program) and college to graduate school (Mentorships for Undergraduate Research Participants in Mathematical and Physical Sciences, MURPPS), along with training graduate students for scientific careers. Students collaborate with scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to understand and enhance the efficiencies for materials with promise for thermoelectric applications. Students develop scientific, social, and professional skills through hands-on training, exploration, and dissemination of research to the broader scientific community.

The research will be presented at national and international meetings and the findings published in peer-review journals.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Thermoelectric materials convert heat directly into electricity or vice versa. With support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project focuses on the synthesis of new Zintl phases, incorporating transition metals and earth abundant elements in order to target a high density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (through partially filled d orbitals) to obtain high Seebeck effect (Power factor) and therefore high zT. Phases will be synthesized as single crystals, high purity powders and pellets via flux, metallurgical routes, and spark plasma sintering. Utilizing a suite of physical characterization techniques including single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, SEM, elemental wave dispersive microprobe, parallel electrical and magnetic measurements, the structure and phase composition will be correlated with electronic and thermal transport properties. The ultimate goal of this project is to discover new materials with high zT for the direct conversion of waste heat into electricity. Building upon recent results of demonstrated high zT in Zintl phases, this proposal closely links synthetic strategies with characterization of physical and chemical properties, thus providing efficient feedback to guide improvement of these thermoelectric systems."

These activities will be undertaken in addition to dissemination efforts via publications, presentations, and workshops to the broader scientific community. <br/><br/>A common problem in many areas of physics is the motion of material in a moving medium. In recent years, a mathematical technique called Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) has been used to model how these materials drift and spread with time. LCS represent the material surface in an unsteady flow separating regions that evolve in qualitatively different ways. Whether the dynamical equations are unknown or unsolvable, the LCS can be an organizing structure in the flow that provides a new context and framework for understanding the system interactions. LCS analysis draws upon the latest knowledge in other disciplines, and it treats the unsteady flow, a historically complex and unpredictable phenomenon. LCS can help to refine our understanding of the underlying dynamics, by providing evidence of the physical processes that lead to unsteady flow divergence. Although LCS has been used to study the motion of clouds of material in wind, aerodynamic flows, and fluids, it has never been applied to the upper atmosphere. In this study, the investigators will use LCS to investigate the behavior of structures (e.g., meteoric smoke particles; climate change-related pollutants; space debris) deposited in the upper atmosphere. The goal is to use LCS to determine the mid-to-high-latitude flow fields and their time evolution, the ability to detect and follow these structures during disturbed conditions, and the seeding and propagation of turbulent mixing at equatorial latitudes, which leads to small-scale disturbances and radio signal scintillation that affects HF communications and satellite-based navigation. Successful development of LCS in this study can enable future studies of LCS analyzing the motion of vertical flow in equatorial regions. LCS analysis can be used to understand the chaotic mixing in IT fluid that may cause scintillation, leading to better operational forecasting."

Such spinor quantum turbulence has yet to be simulated in any real detail, particularly in 3D, and the novel algorithms developed here can be viewed as a mesoscopic model for nonlinear physics.

Understanding of biochemical and cellular processes has profited enormously from the development of high resolution fluorescence techniques. Total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy is a technique that allows high resolution imaging of a thin layer of the cell close to the plasma membrane and has become a standard technique to study membrane proteins. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) provides the capability to extract dynamics from single biological molecules in vitro and in cells yielding crucial insights into their inherently heterogeneous and complex nature. One of the primary limitations of these techniques is that they are highly labor intensive and thus have been primarily restricted for single sample analysis followed by costly manual data processing. The proposed instrument will overcome these challenges by developing high throughput versions of both techniques under a single, cost-effective imaging and data collection platform. In addition, a new analysis package Open Fluorescence Spectroscopy (OpenFS), to be developed by researchers and computer scientists, will be open-source and made freely available online, providing an alternative to costly and proprietary imaging software that is often tied to a particular device. Research enabled by this instrument spans the disciplines of chemistry, physics, molecular biology, and engineering to answer fundamental questions in biology. The ability to perform multiple and single molecule studies at high throughput has the capacity to accelerate basic scientific discoveries essential to the biosciences. The multidisciplinary nature of this project will also create unique training and educational opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral researchers. <br/><br/>The ability to resolve structural rearrangements, biomolecular interactions, and binding kinetics of complex systems is essential to the research aims across multiple disciplines of study including biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. Imaging of fluorescent biomolecules in their natural cellular environment to obtain quantitative information about their dynamic behavior is essential for further understanding their roles in cellular processes. The goal of this project is to develop a unique, versatile, and multi-faceted platform that will extend high temporal and spatial imaging for high throughput TIRF and FCS. The instrument will be able to function in multiple high throughput modes and provide the tools to extract a broad range of biomolecular dynamics using ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence measurements in polymeric, reconstituted, or cellular systems. Due to the multi-modal capabilities of the instrument, a new open-source fluorescence spectroscopy analysis package, Open Fluorescence Spectroscopy (OpenFS), will be developed offering offers reusable software modules for processing of fluorescence spectroscopy data. The instrument will conduct high-throughput, high sensitivity studies in a cost-effective and user friendly format that has the potential to transform studies of biomolecular dynamics and allow the extension of TIRFM and FCS to applications previously inaccessible."

This project seeks to address fundamental issues related to mathematical modeling and numerical simulations of nonlocal dispersive wave equations as well as their solution properties. The proposed project will bridge the gap between different areas, enhance interdisciplinary research, and advance the application of fractional differential equations in practice. Since nonlocal wave equations have broad applications in physics, chemistry, biology and engineering, the research in this project has great potentials to advance the research and technology in relevant areas.<br/><br/>The main objectives of this research are to build mathematical and numerical treatments for the nonlocal Schroedinger wave equations, and to provide a deeper understanding of the modeling with long-range interactions, so as to advance their application to problems with nonlocality.

Integrating the discrete and continuous models offers a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of the nonlocality of the Schroedinger wave equations. On the one hand, accurate algorithms will be developed to improve the efficiency and reduce the computational costs in simulating the DNLS with large lattice sites, especially in two- or three-dimensional lattices. On the other hand, efficient and accurate numerical methods for discretizing the fractional Laplacian will be designed and applied to study the properties of the stationary states and dynamics of fNLS.

These processes are not limited to modern societies, and studying them in prehistoric contexts adds a deeper understanding of these processes. Drs. Mark A. Hill, Kevin C. Nolan, and Mark F. Seeman seek to understand the social world of prehistoric groups commonly referred to as ""Ohio Hopewell."" Hopewell (ca. 50 AD-350 AD) has captivated scholars and the public alike for over a century. This study applies Social Network Analysis (SNA) to discover the differing scales and nature of interaction that will allow a reconstruction of the texture of variable group membership in Ohio Hopewell. This will not only help to understand the broad sweep of prehistory and the specific social realities that molded the past, but will also provide a better understanding of the integration of human social groups in general.<br/><br/>There is no one ""Hopewell""; the many Hopewell-linked groups are characterized by variable participation in a variety of information and goods exchange networks. Until explicit and robust methods of classification and analysis are applied to understanding social interaction and integration, researchers will be unable to grasp the complexity, detail, and meaning of each overlying network. SNA has been successfully used in ethnographic and archaeological research around the world, and is now the most appropriate tool for beginning to disentangle the complex web that forms Ohio Hopewell. SNA offers a robust and objective set of quantitative methods for reconstructing connections among groups and its application here will be the first in the region, and among the first in eastern North America. This study, assumes that what falls under the ""Ohio Hopewell"" rubric is a series of dispersed family clusters choosing to participate variably in networks at a number of related, but distinct scales. Many divisions of Ohio Hopewell have been proposed; however, there has been no consistent or replicated method or conclusion of network classification. As a first step, the research focuses on Ohio Hopewell communities within the Scioto River watershed of southcentral Ohio. The project analyzes three explicit spatial scales of interaction through a combination of micro- and macro-stylistic attributes, and raw material source analysis. (1) The local/community level is targeted by a series of ceramic production traits which would be learned through enculturation and apprenticeships but not readily visible to outsiders (micro-style). (2) The regional/intercommunity level is targeted by analyzing the distribution of lithic raw material proportions and ceramic vessel elements that are externally observable (macro-style) and can be transmitted among communities. (3) The extra-regional scale of interaction is targeted by the sourcing of rare exotic materials (copper, silver) via Laser Ablation Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry.<br/><br/>There will be patterns (and potentially many) at each scale. With this multi-scalar approach, the project will build a detailed picture of how the larger Ohio Hopewell networks are constructed from the bottom up, by families and communities."

Under rapid blood flow conditions associated with injury, the plasma protein von Willebrand Factor (vWF) plays an indispensable role in sticking to both platelets and collagen on damaged vessel walls, allowing the formation of platelet plugs. vWF effectively senses blood flow, changing conformation in high flow from a compact globule to an elongated shape; this reveals binding sites on vWF for platelets and collagen. Abnormalities in vWF adhesion are involved in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases, such as von Willebrand disease (affecting 1 to 2% of world's population), thrombosis and arteriosclerosis. Although basic biological properties of vWF have been elucidated, little is known about the detailed biomechanical properties of vWF and how these properties dictate its structure and function in varying flow environments. Such information can abet not only better understanding of vWF; it can provide insight for the design of synthetic molecules in pursuit of targeted drug therapies, advancing federal interests in health and medicine.<br/><br/>This project will establish, for the first time, a generalized experimental and theoretical platform to investigate the mechanical properties of complicated, multi-domain molecules such as vWF. The platform advanced will provide transformative predictive capability for how flow sensitive biopolymers behave in specific vascular flow scenarios and how that behavior depends on molecular architecture and biological surface chemistry. A single-molecule force spectroscopy will be implemented to systematically probe the mechanical response of vWF monomer fragments, monomers, and multimers; data so obtained will be used to optimize new coarse grain molecular models that predict vWF mechanical behavior with unprecedented quantitative accuracy. The model's predictive capabilities will be further enhanced via fluorescence microscopy analysis of vWF in microfluidic flow chambers with systematically functionalized surfaces. The optimized model will be used to explore how changes to molecular architecture influence biological functionality in varying flow conditions. This work will enable a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying conformational changes of vWF and lay crucial groundwork toward biologically inspired materials design and the development of biomimetic devices that resemble the functionality of known biopolymers. In addition, the study will fill the long-standing knowledge gap on the mechanobiology of vWF, and potentially offer new therapeutic approaches to treat von Willebrand disease. This project will educate both undergraduate and graduate STEM students in experimental and theoretical aspects of biomolecular investigation, emphasizing the need for multi-disciplinary, diverse collaborations between practitioners of experiment, computation, and theory. Such immersive STEM educational experiences will best prepare students to confront technological challenges of the future. Through associated outreach efforts, this work will showcase for both technical and non-technical societal audiences the power of high performance computing in exploring complex molecular behavior and advancing new solutions in human health and wellness."

More specifically, the CAREER Award will fund Pelayo's investigations on classical and quantum semitoric systems. A classical semitoric system is an integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom for which one component generates a periodic flow. For mathematicians, semitoric systems form the next natural class of systems after toric systems. Semitoric systems retain some properties of toric systems, while at the same time they exhibit a much greater flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in the existence of singularities which are dynamically and symplectically rich.Semitoric systems are commonly found in simple physical models and arise naturally as examples in analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry. As a matter of fact, a semitoric system defines a singular toric fibration whose base comes endowed with a singular integral affine structure. These singular affine structures are a central concept in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry. A semitoric quantum system is given by two commuting self-adjoint semiclassical operators acting on a Hilbert space whose principal symbols form a classical semitoric system. One of Pelayo's main goals is to study the spectral theory of semitoric quantum systems and how it relates to classical systems. Concretely, Pelayo's plan is to work towards verifying that the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system determines completely the system; this is the Spectral Conjecture, widely considered the most spectacular problem in the area. Proving this conjecture requires establishing a number of results in semiclassical analysis, giving a tool for future research in the field, independent of the conjecture. Another component of Pelayo's research plans is to continue studying semitoric systems in a more general context, in particular as it regards to the study of the convexity and connectivity properties of the singular Lagrangian fibrations which semitoric systems induce, and which are of special interest in mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The research that the CAREER Award will support belongs to the context of dynamics and geometry. Dynamics is the study of the motion of bodies. Geometry is the study of shape (broadly understood) of objects and spaces.More specifically, the CAREER Award will support Pelayo's research at the intersection of symplectic geometry, spectral theory and dynamics. Symplectic geometry has its roots in physics, and provides an appropriate mathematical framework to study many problems of physics and chemistry and their quantum counterparts. Pelayo's research on this topic exhibits the interplay between mathematical and physical theories. Indeed, several groups of physicists and chemists working on modern quantum spectroscopy have been interested in seeing how mathematical methods can contribute to advance their research, and predict new physical phenomena. They have been particularly interested in understanding the global structure of joint energy-momentum spectra of small molecules. Even more, they have recognized the pivotal role that mathematical invariants play in this problem. Their works have motivated a large number of mathematical questions. The physicists have asked whether one can single out an optimal set of mathematical invariants that would characterize a physical system and then detect these invariants in the spectrum of the system. The detection of the invariants in the system spectrum will allow us to reconstruct the system and hence predict new phenomena. The CAREER Award will support Pelayo's investigations into this crucial question. These applications to quantum molecular spectroscopy are integrated in Pelayo's approach of employing methods from pure mathematics (symplectic and spectral theory, microlocal analysis) to address problems from the applied sciences. More generally, Pelayo's research is focused on a fundamental type of physical system, the so called integrable systems. One can find direct applications of integrable systems in numerous contexts. Some such examples are nonlinear control, locomotion generation in robotics, elasticity theory, plasma physics, field theory and planetary mission design. In order to communicate this relevance of mathematical research to the general public, Pelayo has been interviewed on several occasions by the press (radio and magazines with several hundred thousand audience members). He has commented and advocated for an understanding of the leading role that mathematicians play in the advance of applied science and technology in society. Pelayo will continue actively reaching out to the general public during the tenure of the award, and will continue to take a leading role at Washington University outreach programs. In this respect he will run a Talent Identification Program at Washington University to encourage and nurture undergraduate research at an early stage."

The project has a strong education component since all three PI institutions have very active programs in education and outreach; the NJIT and CSUN have highly diverse environment, with many minority students.

The project will promote strong international collaborations for the benefit of advancing space weather research both in the USA and worldwide.<br/><br/>The research plan of this 3-year SHINE project includes three main tasks. The first task is to study the long-term variation of the statistical properties of filaments that carries important information about the magnetic signature of the solar cycles. The project team will focus the research on the statistical and cycle dependent properties of filaments, in particular polar crown filaments that are related to the interface between the new and the old solar cycles. The second main task is to track plasma flows using features from H-alpha images as proxy for the magnetic features. The most important components include the differential rotation and meridional flows. Both are closely related to the dynamo signature of solar cycles. Since the SOHO and SDO data are limited to solar cycles 23 and 24, which may be atypical in respect to low level of activity, to accomplish this task the project team will utilize their own data, which spans over 9 solar cycles of both high and low amplitudes. The third task is to investigate the distribution of filament chirality and their cycle variations, which reflect the global structure of helicity. The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the long-term variation of the global solar activity, which is the major source of high-energy disturbances in the solar, heliospheric, and interplanetary environment.

More precisely, the PI focuses on singularity analysis of possible finite time singularities occurring in those evolution equations. Such equations appear in quantum field theory, plasma physics, thin liquid film dynamics. More precisely, one of the things the PI wants to study is the regularity of nonlinear geometric flows, such as finding the minimal geometric conditions that will guarantee the smooth existence of a solution to the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The other thing the PI would like to understand are the ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows and their classification. It is well known that ancient solutions arise as singularity models (blown up limits) at finite time singularities. Their classification is crucial for better understanding the singularities that may occur in finite time. Ancient solutions to the two dimensional Ricci flow describe trajectories of the renormalization group equations of certain asymptotically free local quantum field theories in the ultra-violet regime. One special class of ancient solutions are Ricci solitons. The PI would like to study those, having an ultimate goal of classifying generic singularities of a generic Ricci flow. <br/><br/>The project the PI proposes links many different active fields of mathematics, such as nonlinear analysis, differential geometry and topology. The proposed research activity on singularity analysis and regularity of nonlinear parabolic geometric evolution equations may result in interesting applications in geometry and topology. There may be potential application in physics as well. It is well known that the Ricci flow theory has lead to a solution of the Poincare conjecture in topology. The hope is that geometric flows may help solving other important topological question such as the classification of manifolds in higher dimensions. One of the main obstacles in order to even approach such a difficult question like that by using the flow theory is understanding the singularity formation and the classification of singularities, since one can not hope the flow will exist forever. Most likely it will develop singularities in finite time. The PI proposes to understand the formation of singularities in the flows such as the Ricci flow, mean curvature flow, the Yamabe flow and therefore contribute to finding a way to approach the big mentioned problem above."

In nature diamond nanocrystals are formed through non-equilibrium events including stellar supernovae or the impact of meteors on Earth. More recently, diamond nanocrystals have been synthesized directly within laboratories through the detonation of high explosives (i.e., TNT), pulsed laser irradiation of carbon nanoparticles, or through direct growth within non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma reactors. Size is a crucial parameter for diamond nanocrystals in that it impacts how quickly these materials are cleared from the body through filtration in the kidneys. Furthermore, composition is critically important for diamond nanocrystals in that it determines the optical and electronic properties. Currently there are no synthetic protocols that enable control over both the 1) size and 2) defect composition of diamond nanocrystals. This research will generate valuable fundamental knowledge for controlling both of these crucial parameters. Additionally, there currently is no known shallow n-type donor in diamond materials. This research will also pursue the experimental demonstration of n-type conductivity within diamond nanocrystals that would be valuable to society at large by enabling beneficial high-frequency, high-power optoelectronic devices for information processing, UV water-purification, and extreme environment coatings. The educational outreach efforts proposed here will build a learning pathway for senior undergraduate students to develop skills with advanced numerical methods through the development of a numerical computing module integrated within the existing engineering curriculum at the University of Washington. These skills will prepare students for careers within the optoelectronic materials industry, or for continuing their education in graduate school. Outreach efforts to Native Alaskan elementary students, undergraduates in the Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program at the University of Alaska, and Indigenous Alliance outreach at UW will help inspire & retain the next generation of underrepresented materials scientists.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Currently there are no options in the scientific literature for rationally synthesizing nanodiamonds with precise 1) sizes and 2) compositions. The intellectual merit of this proposal rests on generating new knowledge for how to use high-pressure/high-temperature diffusion-doping to generate precise 1) sizes and 2) optoelectronic point-defects in nanodiamond. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, four primary research milestones will be pursued over 5 years: 1) Test the hypothesis that reducing the grain-size of amorphous-carbon nanoparticles will reduce the thermodynamic conditions necessary to produce nanoscale diamond grains through high-pressure/high-temperature techniques. The chemical-potential for carbon atoms at the surface of amorphous-carbon is size-dependent (stemming from the Gibbs-Thomson effect) which may lower the minimum temperature and pressure of the amorphous-carbon / diamond phase-transition. 2) A predictive numerical model will be employed for photothermal heating of highly-absorbing amorphous-carbon materials in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell based on an analytical eigenfunction expansion solution for the energy partial differential equation using spherical coordinates. 3) Molecular doping strategies will be used to control the concentration of model point-defects using either silicon- or nickel- heteroatoms within the diamond lattice. 4) Prior results for synthesizing doped diamond nanocrystals from amorphous-carbon will inform high-risk / high-reward experimental efforts to observe a theoretically-proposed, polyatomic n-type defect center in diamond. The experimental & theoretical approaches will provide an integrated understanding of how the size and composition of amorphous-carbon grains determine final nanodiamond properties"

The project's most immediate impact is in the development of novel aerospace technologies and in important U.S. initiatives in the development of clean energy, biotechnology, and new materials.

To achieve a full three-dimensional solution suitable for use in applications, fast scalable adaptive numerical approaches for evaluating the five-fold Boltzmann collision integral need to be devised. This proposal will address these shortcomings by developing convolution formulations of the Boltzmann collision integral based on nodal discontinuous Galerkin (nodal-DG) discretizations in the velocity variable, by developing adaptable nodal-DG wavelet discretizations of the collision operator on octree meshes, and by developing fast algorithms for evaluating the convolution form of the collision integral based on an application of the Fourier transform. The new methods will require at most O(n^6) operations for a fully deterministic evaluation of the Boltzmann collision integral, and will require O(n^5) memory units to store the pre-computed collision kernels, where n is the number of discretization points in one dimension in the velocity space. The new methods will be implemented on parallel architectures and will be scalable. Implementation of this proposal will result in the development of capabilities for producing high-fidelity solutions to the Boltzmann equation, capabilities for producing benchmark solutions and methods for validation of kinetic models.

The ionosphere, thermosphere, and magnetosphere comprise a tightly coupled system at high latitudes. The ionosphere is the mediating element in this view, facilitating the transfer of free energy generated by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling into heat and bulk motion of the neutral atmosphere. This mediation occurs through electric fields, particle precipitation, diffusion, and field-aligned currents, agents that act collectively to structure the plasma density and composition within the system. Although elements of this system have been studied in considerable detail, their nonlinear interactions, and the global implications of these regional processes, remains poorly understood and inadequately observed. The electronic steering capability of PFISR offers a unique diagnostic to fill this gap. Using a dense grid of beams, a three-dimensional, time dependent view of the ion-neutral interactions can be developed. These results, in coordination with observations by common volume optical, and VHF and HF radar observations, allow access to system dynamics and system responses which were previously unobservable. The experimental campaign, involving twenty researchers from nine institutions, will be carried out over two winter seasons. The results will be used to address fundamental questions of the physics of the upper atmosphere and its coupling to the magnetosphere and the lower atmosphere, which have remained obscured for lack of key data. As a result, although it is understood that small-scale processes play critically important roles in this coupling, they have been difficult to include in quantitative models.

It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of ""understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system"". <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere."

Various interconnect solutions developed to date have not yet been able to replace Copper (Cu) interconnects due to their limitations in performance and/or difficulties in fabrication. In this project, novel Copper, Graphene, Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) hybrid interconnects will be demonstrated and explored by both simulations and experiments, which can compete with Cu nanowires with the same dimensions, and meanwhile have the potential to become the ultimate interconnect solution. The students who participate in this work will be trained with a broad range of skills to sustain future nanotechnology advancement. Education and outreach activities such as inclusive curriculum and culturally relevant teaching, Nano Days in the Birck Nanotechnology Center at Purdue, are also being developed to actively engage women and under-represented minorities into Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>The entire physical process that takes place in a Cu/Graphene/TMD interconnect is yet to be fully understood. The challenge is to understand intricate interactions between multiphysics phenomena involving circuits, electromagnetics, materials, electron transport, and thermal diffusion in a broad band of frequencies. Experimentally, a rapid low-temperature process is critical to preserve the structural integrity of the Cu nanowires during deposition and will be studied. To conquer the aforementioned challenges, multiphysics simulation algorithms and experimental methods will be pursued. On the experimental side, a low temperature chemical vapor deposition recipe, along with a plasma enhanced process, will be developed. Electrical and thermal transport measurements will be performed and correlated with simulations."

The ionosphere, thermosphere, and magnetosphere comprise a tightly coupled system at high latitudes. The ionosphere is the mediating element in this view, facilitating the transfer of free energy generated by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling into heat and bulk motion of the neutral atmosphere. This mediation occurs through electric fields, particle precipitation, diffusion, and field-aligned currents, agents that act collectively to structure the plasma density and composition within the system. Although elements of this system have been studied in considerable detail, their nonlinear interactions, and the global implications of these regional processes, remains poorly understood and inadequately observed. The electronic steering capability of PFISR offers a unique diagnostic to fill this gap. Using a dense grid of beams, a three-dimensional, time dependent view of the ion-neutral interactions can be developed. These results, in coordination with observations by common volume optical, and VHF and HF radar observations, allow access to system dynamics and system responses which were previously unobservable. The experimental campaign, involving twenty researchers from nine institutions, will be carried out over two winter seasons. The results will be used to address fundamental questions of the physics of the upper atmosphere and its coupling to the magnetosphere and the lower atmosphere, which have remained obscured for lack of key data. As a result, although it is understood that small-scale processes play critically important roles in this coupling, they have been difficult to include in quantitative models. The new information will be implemented in the GITM model validating the new understanding of the coupled magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere, and thereby providing enhanced simulation capabilities."

The potential outcome of the proposed work will be a low-cost, easy to apply, thermal barrier coating that bonds to exhaust components, reducing the net heat loss from the exhaust to the surrounding components. Thermal exhaust coatings offer improved engine and catalytic efficiency, lower under-hood temperature, and reduce vehicle weight. The net effect for the consumer is improved efficiency, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced pollution, improved safety, and lower cost. The net outcome for automobile manufacturers will be higher corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) scores, a simplified manufacturing process, and an estimated cost savings of $20 per vehicle. Current ceramic exhaust coatings are too costly for use by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The potential outcome of the proposed research is a ceramic exhaust coating for use in a thermal management system appropriate for OEM use.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project derives from the advancement of low-cost, easy to apply, chemically-bonded ceramics into a market currently occupied by difficult-to-apply plasma sprayed ceramic coatings. Target features for these coatings include thermal conductivity less than 5 W/m-K, emissivity below 0.3, adhesion to exhaust-grade stainless steel, thermal stability, wear resistance, chemical resistance, and ease of coating and integration into the vehicle manufacture supply chain. CBACNs may be formulated with a wide range of physical properties not obtainable in a sintered ceramic system.

This is indicated robustly in individual galaxies by the gas mass fraction, the percentage of mass contained in both hot plasma and cool atomic & molecular hydrogen--as opposed to mass contained in stars. A small gas fraction indicates--in general--an evolved system with reduced capacity for forming new stars, while a large gas fraction suggests the potential for large star formation and metal-enrichment of the interstellar medium. In collaboration with Prof. Yanmei Chen (Nanjing University: Nanjing, Jiansu, China), the PI will construct statistically-robust estimates of stellar mass, and compare to his existing measurements of spatially-resolved gas mass. The radial variation of gas mass fraction will be compared with estimates of total galaxy mass, star formation rate, and galaxy environment density.<br/><br/>In the new era of integral-field spectroscopic surveys (such as MaNGA, SAMI, and CALIFA), responsive, robust, and cheap methods of stellar-continuum fitting are necessary counterparts to large, nightly datastreams. Most methods of stellar-mass estimation are computationally costly, and do not take advantage of modern advances in statistics and machine learning. Prof. Yanmei Chen has developed a method of fitting the stellar continuum, which relies on the one-off principal-component analysis (PCA) of a library of single stellar population (SSP) models, which yields order-of-magnitude improvements in compute time and will enable the use of larger, more flexible SSP libraries. The PI has obtained a set of fully-theoretical SSP models, with a spectral resolution exceeding that of MaNGA. Such SSPs include near-IR features like the CaII triplet (necessary for breaking the age-metallicity degeneracy), and improve on existing models of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB). Combining the high-resolution stellar library with Chen's PCA code (translated by the PI from IDL to Python) will yield measurable improvements in resolved stellar-mass estimates. When paired with resolved total gas mass (HI + H2), estimated using new optical-spectroscopic methods (rather than from expensive, radio-band follow-up), a census of stars and gas in nearby galaxies will result. These single-source estimates of galaxy evolutionary state will improve current knowledge of galactic chemical evolution and mass assembly, and place the Milky Way in a cosmic context.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China."

While there is strong evidence that the Universe's first second included a period of accelerated expansion called inflation, we do know why inflation happened or why it ended. We also do not know how the Universe transitioned to a hot, radiation-dominated state after inflation. Furthermore, our ignorance of the dynamics of the early Universe severely limits our understanding of the origins of dark matter, which is a poorly understood source of mass that currently makes up about 25% of the Universe's energy density. Many proposed explanations for dark matter postulate that dark matter originated from the hot plasma that filled the Universe during its first second. Consequently, the evolution of the Universe during that time affects the relationship between the properties of the dark matter particle and amount of dark matter in the Universe. This project will enhance our understanding of inflation, the onset of radiation domination, and the origins of dark matter by using gamma-ray observations to constrain the abundance of the smallest gravitationally bound structures of dark matter. <br/><br/>The PI will engage undergraduate students, high school students, and the general public in the proposed investigation of dark matter microhalos. Undergraduate students will analyze simulations of microhalo formation, thereby learning data analysis techniques and scientific programming. They will also gain first-hand research experience, which will expose them to the excitement of STEM careers. A module on dark matter will be developed for high school students to give them the opportunity to analyze publically available kinematic data for dwarf spheroidal and spiral galaxies. The PI will then lead four professional development workshops at teacher conferences to train high school teachers to use this module in their physics courses. Finally, the PI will present her research at Morehead?s monthly Carolina Science Cafe, which provides the general public the opportunity to interact with a scientific researcher in an informal setting.<br/><br/>These small dark matter structures, called microhalos, grow from density perturbations that were generated during inflation on scales that are inaccessible by other cosmological observations. They also began to evolve during the Universe's first second, prior to the onset of nucleosynthesis. This project will extend the PI's earlier analyses of microhalos' capacity to probe the evolution of the early Universe to a wider range of dark matter particles and will use N-body simulations of small volumes at high redshifts to test these analytical predictions for the microhalo abundance. These simulations will also determine how the properties of the small-scale density perturbations affect the microhalos' internal structures. The PI will then calculate the expected gamma-ray emission from dark matter annihilation within these microhalos. The resulting constraints on the small-scale primordial density fluctuations and the onset of radiation domination will determine which inflationary models are compatible with thermal-relic dark matter and may break the degeneracy between the relic density of dark matter and the evolution of the early Universe."

Like radars, the LIDARs (LIght Detection And Ranging) are the devices that can examine various properties of the upper atmosphere from a large distance and at various altitudes. From a single location, these devices can scan the environments and observe polar atmosphere and ionosphere at the 80-200 km altitude within a wide sector covering thousands of square miles. They monitor an atmospheric chemical composition, temperature and other features, analyze atmospheric gravity waves, and measure vertical winds and interaction between plasma and neutral winds. The lidars also can study features and irregularities of various layers of the atmosphere, and monitor their dynamics.<br/><br/>Many scientists are already using the data of the previously installed instrument, and the new lidar will bring another kind of measurements of airglow with high temporal and spatial resolution. Simultaneous monitoring of many atmospheric parameters enriches our understanding of atmospheric dynamics in general and gravity waves, mixing, and vertical transport in the studied region. By fully characterizing vertical constituent transport in the mesopause region caused by gravity waves and turbulence, as well as determining the differential ablation of Na and Fe, will substantially reduce the large uncertainties in current estimates of cosmic dust influx into the Earth's atmosphere. Accurate observation of these essential parameters will provide important data sets of polar atmosphere conditions and dynamics and allow obtaining new crucial information for many scientists and many areas, including weather studies, atmospheric and ionospheric studies, and others. This research effort will continue to develop the NSF-funded instrumentation network to help addressing fundamental questions of the Geospace research that have not yet thoroughly examined."

A series of models from the molecular to the tissue scale will be constructed and linked together. The stiffness and strength of the tissue will be estimated based on the protein properties, as will the permeability of the tissue (i.e., its tendency to permit filtration flow through it). Finally, changes in the properties of the tissue, coupled with the known demand for filtration, will be used to model dynamic changes in the GBM in response to changes in load or protein properties.<br/>If successful, these studies will help explain how the kidney, which filters 40-50 gallons of blood every day, performs in healthy conditions and suffers decreased performance in disease. The new understanding may help drive treatments for patients with genetic diseases that affect the kidney (e.g., Alport syndrome) and also for patients with kidney disease arising from other sources, such as diabetes.

Feldspars are the most abundant minerals in the Earth's crust, comprising of more than 50% of the Crust volume. For the former, one global warming mitigation strategy is geological carbon sequestration, for which CO2 is stored in deep underground geological formations. However, the injected CO2 will acidify the native brine and dissolve feldspars in the reservoirs, which could affect the reservoir quality and the long-term safety of storage. For the latter, the weathering of feldspars as an abundant mineral in the Critical Zone is critical to rates of soil development and the buffer capacity of the Critical Zone to stresses. However, to assess how fast feldspar dissolution or weathering takes place (chemical kinetics), we need to wrestle with one of the fundamental challenges in geochemistry. It has been known for a long time that the laboratory measured dissolution rates of feldspars are two to five orders of magnitude faster than rates estimated from field studies. Without resolving this seemingly intractable obstacle, we cannot quantitatively evaluate a number of environmental and geological processes, such as those mentioned above. <br/><br/>This study is designed to test the promising hypothesis that would partly resolve the apparent discrepancy: A large part of the discrepancy between in situ field and laboratory rates results from the coupling of the dissolution and precipitation reaction in the field systems which is absent in most laboratory experiments. Historically, the determination of very slow feldspar dissolution rates in laboratory at ambient temperatures has been problematic. Slow reaction rates mean that solutes may be below analytical detection limits, thus affecting the accuracy of the experiments. Here, the investigator proposes an innovative utilization of newly developed technology - High-Resolution Multi-Collector Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry - and uses a novel design of stable silicon isotope 'spikes' to overcome these obstacles in order to determine feldspar reaction rates at ambient and near equilibrium conditions, not previously possible. <br/><br/>The work will involve cooperation among the investigator at Indiana University and his colleagues at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, and at Trent University in Canada. Funding is requested only for the US organization. This study will enhance international and multi-disciplinary collaboration and contribute to the training of a post-doctoral associate and an exchange student from Israel. Te investigator is currently conducting research on the industrial scale CO2 storage project in Norway (the Sleipner project) and will communicate the results from this study to the CO2 storage community and the Critical Zone research community."

It builds on existing capabilities to identify the electrical activity of native point defects on a nanometer scale using optical and electronic techniques, to measure their effect on carrier densities and atomic dopant concentrations quantitatively, and to controllably introduce or suppress these native point defects using nanoscale surface science techniques. Native point defects have a major effect on ZnO Schottky barrier heights, and their interplay with dopant impurities influence plasmonic-resonance wavelengths in ZnO. Because ZnO exhibits a wide range of contact rectification with metals, it can serve to test the relative contributions of thermionic, tunneling, and hopping transport through ZnO-metal interfaces on both a macroscopic and nanometer scale, and the balance of physical mechanisms can be used to understand barriers to charge transport for a wide range of compound semiconductor junctions. The carrier densities influenced by native point defects can in turn alter the dielectric response of ZnO and thus the plasmon-resonance frequency used to couple light waves to ultrahigh frequency electronics. This project employs a combination of growth, plasma processing, and atomic indiffusion to control near-interface doping and native point defects on a nanometer scale for both barrier rectification and plasmonic coupling.<br/><br/>Non-technical Description: Semiconductor defects are imperfections such as missing atoms or impurities in otherwise perfect semiconductor crystals. They can be electrically-active, altering the amount of electrical charge free to travel inside transistors, lasers, and other electronic devices. They can also serve as shortcuts for charge to move through electronic barriers usually designed to block such charge movement for transistor switching, charge storage, or carrier confined light emission. The influence of these defects in charge movement across ZnO interfaces provides a test bed to understand and control other semiconductors, an issue starting when these materials were first used for electronics. Their control can enable high carrier densities for transparent electronics such as heads-up displays and smart windows, high positive charge densities for lasers, and control of the coupling between light waves and electronic circuits at wavelengths important for telecommunications. The project provides training of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school women in both basic scientific laboratory techniques and advanced micro- and optoelectronic concepts. Students interact directly with international collaborators at the University of Oslo, Sweden, Aalto University, Finland, and CNRS / CRHEA, France. The project involves and supports women at the high school through the Columbus School for Girls' summer research internship program, building on NSF core funding with support from several Ohio State University institutions."

It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of ""understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system"". <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere."

Of particular interest is the coupling of the lower atmosphere to the ionized layer near 100-150 km that is called the ""dynamo region"". Large-scale wave variations of winds and temperatures in the lower atmosphere that are called thermal tides are generated by the heating caused by the daily passage of the Sun overhead or by the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor or stratospheric ozone at tropical latitudes. Other large-scale waves called planetary waves (PW) may also be caused by weather activity within the lower atmosphere. These large-scale waves may have periodicities as long as 16 days and very large horizontal wavelengths (thousands of km). These waves will propagate to higher altitudes where the winds, ionized gas content, and Earth?s magnetic field interact to generate electric fields and currents. These, in turn, will induce magnetic field perturbations that may be measured by the global network of magnetometers (141 sites). The production of PW and tidal waves within the lower atmosphere is highly variable, and consequently, the winds and temperature profiles associated with these wave structures will exhibit significant variability from day-to-day that can be detected through the application of sophisticated analysis procedures to the global magnetometer data. Part of the research motivation for this approach is that the electric fields generated within the dynamo region will map upward into the ionosphere above 250 km and generate variability of electron density at high altitudes that need to be understood for successful space weather forecasting, which has been given national priority. The research supported by this award would determine the ionospheric variability using the magnetometer data to measure the meridional and zonal components of magnetic field variations relative to a steady state baseline. The origins of this variability can then be considered in regard to possible factors to identify causal relationships. The award represents a strong potential for exciting and transformative science because the global analysis of ground magnetometer data will provide new insights into atmosphere-ionosphere coupling by tides and PW in a way that cannot be achieved by any satellite-based series of observations that is limited by the nature of local time sampling of the ionospheric variability. The broader impact of this award is that a woman Egyptian graduate student would be supported in her PhD work in this award thus enhancing the cultural diversity of the aeronomy community.<br/><br/>The science motivation for this award is summarized by the following list of physical processes that need to be fully understood to understand space weather variability: (1) The dynamo region (ca.100-150 km) of Earth?s atmosphere is where electric fields are mainly generated through the dynamo action of neutral winds during daytime; (2) These electric fields have profound influences on the variability of the whole ionosphere; (3) Dynamo region variability is thought to originate from solar flux influences on electrical conductivity, and from the variability imposed by tidal and PW neutral winds, and disturbance winds associated with geomagnetic activity; (4) This variability has never been observationally quantified globally in a systematic way; (5) Knowledge concerning the variability of the dynamo region provides insight into the sources of variability for the overlying ionosphere; and (6) A global array of ground magnetometers exists that can provide the above knowledge. Examination of the global magnetometer data through application of standard time-series analysis tools would seek to understand the cause-effect factors underlying the ionospheric variability with the focus being that a major fraction of this ionospheric variability is likely to be caused by the large-scale waves reaching into this region from below. These results would be compared with variations of the standard solar and magnetic field indices to search for evidence of causal relationships between the tides and PW excited in the lower atmosphere and whose influences extend into the 100-150 km dynamo region generate electric fields that then map along magnetic field lines into the F region ionosphere. The F-region plasma redistributions that they produce carry with them the spatial and temporal signatures of these tides and PW, and of the processes that produced or modified them at lower altitudes."

Another example is the curve outlining the wake of a boat. Yet another is the interface between plasma and ordinary matter in a fusion reactor. Remarkably, the same mathematics of free boundaries that describes these physical phenomena can be used to design optimal shapes. For example, when one wants to enclose an oven or pipe with insulating material, there is a shape that is optimal in the sense that the sum of the cost of insulation and the cost due to heat loss is minimized. Moreover, even farther from physics, one can seek optimal ways to divide data sets into yes/no regions according to rules that minimize the errors, that is, false positive or false negative identifications or diagnoses. The overarching goal of this project is to reduce the complexity of the problem of searching for these optimal shapes. The expectation is that there are broad classes of situations in which the optimal divider (free boundary) resembles a straight line or plane at an appropriate scale. In those cases, one can be confident of finding a near optimal shape quickly. In addition to conducting his own research, the PI has served and will serve as faculty advisor for research projects by dozens of undergraduates and high school students in programs at MIT. Moreover, he has posted videos and lecture notes of a widely viewed single variable calculus course on MIT's Open Courseware site. He is currently working on an on-line course to be disseminated by MITx.<br/><br/>Free boundaries arise as the interface between materials in which the materials retain some energy. Typically, space is divided into level sets of some quantity like temperature or pressure. In contrast, the interface represented by a minimal surface lives in an ambient space that is empty. Despite this difference between these two types of interfaces, there are profound connections between them. The main goal of this project is to show that interfaces and level sets of least energy for a wide variety of problems are as simple as possible. The PI proposes that the level sets of optimizers resemble parallel planes in that these surfaces are connected and cleanly separated. Usually, methods from the more developed theory of minimal surfaces have guided the study of free boundaries, but here ideas from the theory of free boundaries will guide the study of minimal surfaces. The proposal also gives a pathway to proving analogous simple behavior of level sets of the least energy Neumann eigenfunction for a convex symmetric domain. This would yield an important case of the longstanding ``hot spots'' conjecture of J. Rauch. A second project is to identify the cases of equality in the celebrated Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities in convex geometry. The PI will use a geometric approach based on establishing new properties, of independent interest, of the Brenier (optimal transportation) mapping. A third project is aimed at developing a highly accurate description of localization of eigenfunctions and quantum tunneling, relevant to the design of LEDs."

The question will be assessed through the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration at the start of lactation in cattle because they are well suited for these studies and are very tractable experimental systems. This project will support research training for under-represented students at the nexus of biology, agriculture, and medicine, provide unique experience for several advanced trainees, and generate transformative information relevant to a broad spectrum of the public. Under-represented students will be recruited to participate in the entire research process, from treatment application to presentation of results. A post-doctoral associate and PhD students will also be mentored. Additional societal benefit may be afforded by utilization of the basic research results for the development of applied management strategies in agriculture.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to assess whether endogenous inflammation in early lactation is necessary to induce insulin resistance and conserve glucose as nutrient demands for the mammary gland increase. Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose kinetics, as well as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue markers of inflammation and insulin signaling will be measured in cows at high and low milking frequency. Milking frequency will alter milk yield, allowing for the assessment of whether inflammation-mediated homeorhetic processes are particularly important for supporting extreme milk yields. By blocking endogenous low-grade inflammation in early lactation, anti-inflammatory treatment is expected to increase insulin sensitivity, resulting in increased muscle and adipose tissue utilization of glucose, suppressed liver gluconeogenesis, and impaired regulation of plasma glucose concentration in early lactation.

The strong interaction sector of the Standard Model is described by the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as a quantum field theory of quarks and gluons. Such quarks and gluons are deeply confined in normal matter. However when normal matter is heated to a high enough temperature, it changes into a new deconfined form of QCD matter directly made of the quarks and gluons. Such a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) briefly occupied the Universe at about a few microseconds after the ""Big Bang"", and has now been (re-)created as the hottest matter ever in laboratory by heavy ion collisions (""Little Bang""). Its properties are measured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the quark-gluon matter created in heavy ion collisions is strongly-interacting both prior to and after reaching thermal equilibrium. Exactly how such strongly interacting nature arises in the many-body setting from the fundamental QCD theory, is a challenging problem that lacks a deep understanding. This project will investigate this missing link and seek to develop effective descriptions of the matter both in and out of equilibrium. The results will advance our understanding of QCD confinement, provide fresh insights into jet quenching mechanism, make significant progress in search of QCD topological effects, and reduce existing uncertainties on the pre-thermal stage. The expected outcome will contribute to our understanding of fundamental questions such as ""how the color confinement phenomenon arises"", and ""how the experimentally observed properties of the quark-gluon matter in and out of equilibrium emerge from QCD"".<br/><br/>The study supported by this award concerns the exploration of new forms of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These activities embody important interdisciplinary aspects, as they are expected to have a profound impact on other areas of physics, ranging from cosmology, supernova, compact stars, to supersymmetric theories, string theories as well as condensed matter physics. This project integrates research with education through mentoring of graduate, as well as undergraduate students. This project will actively pursue a five-year educational outreach plan to develop educational software for computer desktops and mobile devices that utilizes visualization and simulations to demonstrate concepts related to the ""Physics of Extreme Matter"" in an interactive, engaging, and children-friendly manner."

Partial melting of the Earth's upper mantle comprising peridotite and recycled crustal lithologies influences the thermal evolution of the planet, geochemical variability of the crust, differentiation of the interior, fluxes of key volatiles to the exosphere, and geophysical properties of the mantle. While isotopic and trace element geochemistry of erupted basalts have long-established the presence of subducted mid-ocean ridge basaltic (MORB) crust and continental sediment at mantle source regions of ocean island basalts (OIB), the identities of plausible lithologic heterogeneities and how such lithologies impart major element signatures on erupted lavas remain unresolved. Experiments thus far have mostly considered direct partial melting of various lithologies and not the reactive processes involving crust-mantle systems that should be ubiquitous in the convecting mantle. This experimental study will explore how subducted crustal lithologies-derived partial melts and peridotite reaction may produce a wide array of magma compositions and hybrid lithologies. These experiments will be conducted with the aid of piston cylinder (PC) and multi anvil (MA) devices, in order to constrain mantle hybridization via (1) MORB-eclogite-derived partial melts and fertile and depleted peridotite reaction, (2) metapelite-derived partial melts and peridotite reaction, and (3) partial melting of end member hybrid lithologies (modally altered peridotite and pyroxenites) produced by MORB/metapelite melt-peridotite interactions. Experiments are expected to span pressures and temperatures over which subducted crusts and sediments are partially molten but peridotite is unmolten. Major element compositions of reacted partial melts and reacted mineral assemblages will be determined as a function of depth, temperature, original crustal melt and peridotite compositions, extent of partial reactive crystallization, and melt-rock ratio. Furthermore, using high precision electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, fractionation of elements such as first-row transition metals, Gallium, and Germanium will be determined with the goal of using these elements, in conjunction with major element equilibria, to constrain the mineralogic and lithologic heterogeneities of the basalt source regions.<br/><br/>This CAREER project integrates the PI's Earth science research and teaching through a range of educational outreach activities, professional and career developments of students, and contributions to the broad field of earth science research. The proposed experiments will generate key data relevant to a wide range of Earth science disciplines including petrology-geochemistry, mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology. The outreach activities will include a 10-week summer internship for one local community college student typically from underrepresented and minority groups, each year, in the PI's experimental petrology lab and supporting one high school or middle school teacher every year for a 4-week lesson plans development on solid Earth topics and research experience in the experimental lab. These two outreach activities are in line with the mission of and organized in collaboration with School Science and Technology (SST) Programs of Rice University. In addition, contents and visuals depicting the motivation, concepts, results, and implications of the proposed research will be developed by the PI for the 'Teaching Petrology in the 21st Century' website, an open-access resource widely used by petrology instructors for both undergraduate and graduate curriculum across the globe. The research performed as part of this proposal will facilitate operation of a new MA lab and will thus contribute towards collection of new MA pressure calibration and assembly data to be shared with the COMPRES (Consortium for Materials Properties Research in Earth Sciences). The generated experimental data on crust-mantle hybridization (with or without volatiles) will contribute towards newer generation thermodynamic, mineral physics, and geodynamic models of mantle materials and processes. Finally, with partial support from Rice, it is planned to engage two PhD students and recruit as many as five Rice undergraduates in order to advance their academic journey and educational experiences."

The research will expand on previous determinations of the mass density by extending the results closer to the Earth (L~2) and providing a 3D model.

Research in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has shown that these dynamic systems are responsible for increases in dissolved iron concentrations up to 4000 kilometers away from where the vents are located. Previous work has shown that up to 11% of the iron released from seafloor hydrothermal vents exists as pyrite nanoparticles (i.e., particles that can pass thorough a 200 nanometer filter). This nano-pyrite, which has a slow oxidation rate in seawater, and its oxidation products can account for the observed increase in dissolved iron in deep ocean waters. This results in enhanced primary biological productivity because iron is an essential micronutrient for bacteria and plankton upon which larger marine organisms feed. Iron, potassium, magnesium and manganese also get incorporated into nano-sized silicates and aluminosilicates as well as larger solid mineral phases, an example of reverse weathering. This research involves both field and laboratory components that examine the production and impact of nano-sulfides and other minerals on the deep ocean iron budget. The field component involves measuring the extent to which nanoparticle-sized pyrite and other metal sulfide phases emanate from seafloor hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise, a fast spreading mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal center. Results of the chemical and physical analysis of these samples, as well as laboratory experiments, onshore, that grow and perform experiments with synthetic analogs of these phases will explore whether copper-sulfur nanoparticulate phases are seed crystals for the formation of nanoparticulate pyrite and other nano-sized phases. It will also examine the process of reverse weathering, which is how silicate and aluminosilicate nanoparticles form and react when hot metal-rich hydrothermal vent waters interact with cold seawater on the ocean floor, something that occurs within the first couple of meters of the vent orifice. Broader impacts of the work include postdoctoral and graduate and undergraduate student training; support of research at an institution in a state (Delaware) that does not receive significant amounts of federal funding (i.e., an EPScoR state); and public outreach via a dedicated website for the oceanographic research cruise on which a K-12 teacher will attend and produce cruise and research related materials targeted to middle and high school students. Public outreach via the University of Delaware's Coast Day which attracts over 10,000 people will be carried out to transmit the excitement and value of the research. <br/><br/>This research examines both natural and synthetic materials. Natural materials will come from hydrothermal vents located at 9-10 degrees north latitude in the central Pacific Ocean; and synthetic analog materials, for which various chemical parameters such as pH, sulfide, and metal concentrations, will be generated onshore in the laboratory. All particles will undergo, at a minimum, four types of analyses: analysis of the Fe and sulfide content; analysis of trace metals; and scanning and transmission electron microscopic and energy dispersive chemical compositional analysis. Natural samples will be collected from fluids filtered from hydrothermal vents with trace-metal-clean titanium samplers. Upon retrieval of the natural samples, pH will be measured and samples will be filtered in an argon filled glove bag. Samples will be analyzed in triplicate via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for bioactive metals like Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Cd, and Pb. Individual particles will be examined under the transmission and scanning electron microscopes to determine their morphology and mineral structural characteristics and sizes. Synthetic analogs to the natural materials will be generated in the lab by reacting solutions of FeS and H2S with Cu at temperatures from 20 to 150 C.

To date, advanced manufacturing equipment has only been used to accelerate traditional processes for cutting sheet metal or other conventional fabrication activities. Such approaches have not capitalized on the equipment?s full potential, and this project will lay the groundwork to transform steel building construction by investigating the underlying science and engineering precepts to interlocking connections created from precise, volumetric cutting. Such connection system could radically transform how structural steel is fabricated, assembled, deconstructed, and reused. The class of interlocking connections represents the introduction of the first universal, structural steel connector system in more than one-half a century, and it will better engage advanced manufacturing into the US, Irish & UK construction industries. Moreover, it offers the potential for significant reuse of materials that are heavily imported. The activity offers an innovative outreach program with broad-based technical dissemination through webinars and workshops, and educational outreach for K-12 students by means of national-level, student competitions.<br/><br/>The advanced manufacturing for the assembly of structure steel (AMASS) system enhances the integration between design, fabrication, installation and maintenance through building information modeling (BIM) platforms to implement advanced connections. Fully automated, precise, volumetric cutting of open steel sections introduces intellectual challenges regarding the load-transfer mechanisms and failure modes for interlocking connections. The research activity includes closing the knowledge gaps concerning the mechanics, load resistance, and design of steel systems with interlocking connections. Also multi-scale modeling will be applied to investigate the mechanics of interlocking connections including stress and strain concentrations, fracture potential and failure modes, and to optimize connection geometry through parameter studies. Physical data will be collected from full-scale tests of beams, columns and beam-column assemblages with interlocking connections to determine nominal capacities in flexure, shear and axial loading, as well as for appropriate combinations."

These receptors, often called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), typically carry or associate with non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) kinases that initiate complex signaling networks cumulating in broad-spectrum resistance. While it is now widely appreciated that PRRs play a key role in the immune response of plants and animals, little is known about the signaling pathways governing these responses. This is especially true in monocotyledonous species, which are estimated to contain a ten-fold larger number of PRRs as compared to dicots. This project exploits RiceNet, a previously experimentally validated genome-scale functional gene network of rice genes, to explore PRR-mediated immune responses in cereals on a genome-wide scale. Taking advantage of the observation that genetic modifiers of the same gene often cluster in gene networks, novel regulators of PRR-mediated immune responses can be effectively identified and prioritized based on local connectivity in such networks. The project will identify and validate subnetworks (i.e. sets of genes) governing rice, barley and wheat PRR-mediated immune responses, generate a new dataset for rice based on an innovative proteomics approach, and establish a genome-scale functional network for wheat. Results from these studies will lead to major advances in understanding the PRR-mediated immune response of cereal crops. Because pathways controlling PRR-mediated responses in rice are similar to those in other plants and animals, the expected results will be relevant to other species that will serve as a starting point to develop new strategies for engineering resistance in cereal crops. <br/><br/>Researchers at all levels, from undergraduate student interns through postdoctoral scientists, will receive essential training in genomics, proteomics, pathology, and systems biology. The project will organize and hold a Networks in Immunity (NetI) workshop that will facilitate collaborations between increasing numbers of researchers in this important discipline. Results will be made broadly available, allowing for generation of novel hypotheses and biotechnological applications, and serve as a basis for comparative genomics studies.

The use of red and yellow ochre pigments for symbolic purposes is among the most widespread and persistent of human cultural behaviors. However, the study of archaeological ochre has been hindered by ambiguity over how to interpret this iron-based pigment in the absence of obvious symbolic applications such as cave or rock art. This project combines archaeological, geological, and ethnographic methods to investigate prehistoric through modern use of ochre pigments. The investigators have already conducted interviews with the Maasai and Samburu peoples of Kenya, many of whom still use ochre in their daily lives, and identified outcrops of ochre minerals that these groups exploit for symbolic and functional purposes. Geochemical techniques proven to be effective at telling apart ochre from different sources will be used to analyze samples collected from ochre deposits, and to match them to paint samples from rock art sites and ochre artifacts from archaeological sites in the region. This project will refine minimally destructive methods that can be used to analyze the composition of ochre and other iron-containing materials for anthropological, geological, materials science, and forensic applications. Improving techniques for determining the geographic and geologic origin of ochre pigments and related materials has significant implications for identifying looted heritage items and forgeries. The project will also provide opportunities for public science education via museum outreach, international collaborations, and mentoring in the STEM sciences for underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/>Recent discoveries of ochre pigments from Stone Age archaeological sites have shed light on the great temporal depth of human symbolic behavior. Our understanding of the evolutionary significance and potentially the meaning of ancient symbolism using pigments has been enhanced by novel geochemical techniques for provenance studies of ochre, particularly minimally destructive trace element fingerprinting by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry. The project builds on improvements in this method over the last decade by creating a database of trace element and stable isotope (strontium, lead, and iron) fingerprints for ochre sources currently or recently used by inhabitants of the Kenya Rift Valley. The Maasai and Samburu are among the few remaining peoples in East Africa with active rock art and ochre self-adornment traditions. They present the best opportunity for studying how modern humans interact with their geologic environment for symbolic purposes. Once completed, the source database will be used to determine the geologic provenance of ochre artifacts and rock art paints of Stone Age through recent origin that were sampled during field and museum research. This will allow for investigation of hypotheses about symbolically mediated versus least-cost (nearest source) models of mineral deposit exploitation, transport and trade of ochre pigments, and preferential use of specific pigment colors. In addition, the source fingerprint database will be made freely available online for other scientists to use in their own research upon completion of the project."

The overarching objective to investigate the gravity wave-driven coupling between the terrestrial atmosphere and the lower thermosphere/ ionosphere. In-situ instrumentation will measure the perturbations the waves produce in both neutral and ion densities at F-region heights, while on-board photometers will simultaneously measure the wavelengths and amplitudes of the wave fields in the upper mesosphere. Subsequent modeling coupled with meteorological data will reveal the connections between tropospheric storms and the MLTI system using state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques that include the effects of wave dissipation. The ionospheric ion density and temperature will be measured in-situ via the retarding potential analysis (RPA) technique. The electronics for the RPA will be built at Virginia Tech, but will involve only minor modifications to the flight proven UT Dallas design. The in-situ upper atmospheric neutral gas density will be measured by two distinct sensors: a traditional Bayard-Alpert (BA) ion gauge provided by the Aerospace Corporation, and new, diamond-like carbon (DLC) microtip-based gauge design that is better adapted to the power constraints of a CubeSat mission. The University of Illinois will provide a suite of nadir-viewing photometers to measure perturbations in the O2 (0-0) Atmospheric (A) and O2 Herzberg I (HI) band airglow emissions in the 90-100 km region during the nighttime portion of the orbit.<br/><br/>This mission is the first of its kind; no previous satellite experiment has ever been devoted to identifying causal gravity wave links between the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, and no previous experiment has systematically mapped active gravity wave regions at low and middle latitudes through direct observation of their ionospheric effects. These waves are a vitally important but under-explored facet of atmospheric physics. They strongly influence the dynamics of the media through which they travel by modifying the structure of the atmosphere at altitudes well above their source regions, and they may seed the development of plasma instabilities that scintillate and disrupt radio propagation. The fundamental science goals of the experiment are to: 1) systematically observe gravity waves with large vertical wavelengths at lower F-region heights, and correlate on a global scale remotely-sensed wave-induced airglow perturbations in the upper mesosphere with in-situ measurements of ion and neutral density fluctuations at higher altitudes, and 2) produce global maps of active gravity wave regions in the mid- and low-latitude ionosphere over multiple seasons at all local times, so that global patterns and climatological variations can be quantitatively compared to and correlated with terrestrial weather systems via modeling. The challenging cubesat mission is a high-risk effort but one with immensely high potential pay-off in providing a unique observational dataset of fundamental thermosphere and ionosphere parameters and related cutting-edge scientific findings. <br/><br/>Active collaborations between engineering students at Virginia Tech and the University of Illinois will be established during the design, fabrication, integration, and environmental testing of the LAICE payloads and spacecraft; at least 60 undergraduates will participate in one or more phases of the development work, and in subsequent data analysis activities. Strong collaboration will occur between the schools in instrumentation systems, satellite communications, and data analysis. Facilities at both institutions will be used to test, integrate, and calibrate spaceflight hardware, and results will be presented at annual small-spacecraft conferences. All data and scientific findings that flow from the experiment will be made publicly available via a web interface established for this purpose."

Tin oxide is considered one of the most promising metal-oxide anode materials for lithium ion batteries due to its high lithium ion storage capacity. However, the practical application of tin oxide as anode material is restricted by its large volume change (up to 300%) during charge-discharge cycles, which can cause its disintegration and electrical disconnection from the current collector. To circumvent this problem, a three-dimensional carbon nanotube-tin oxide core-shell nanowire array is being developed by growing tin oxide shells on vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes serve as the backbone of the tin oxide shell to buffer the large volume change, while the cylindrical tin oxide shell alleviates its degradation during the lithiation process. This project's outcomes will be beneficial to conventional lithium ion battery research and development, as well as on-chip micropower development. A better understanding of the electrochemical properties is making a significant contribution to the development and rational design of three-dimensional hierarchical electrode nanomaterials for lithium ion batteries. Each year, these researchers provide two public lectures to convey new knowledge of material science and technology. A diverse set of students are engaged in the research at Florida International University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Each year, graduate and undergraduate students participate in the research, and they have the opportunity to work at Sandia National Laboratories. Annually, 60 high school students and 10 high school teachers are invited for on-campus lab tours and research demonstrations. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Carbon nanotube-metal oxide core-shell composite materials are promising candidates for application as anode materials in lithium ion batteries. However, the electrochemical lithiation-delithiation behavior and mechanism of this type of materials remain unclear. A comprehensive understanding of the lithiation mechanism at the nanoscale benefits the design and development of high-performance lithium ion battery materials. This project develops a synergistic approach for the synthesis and characterization of vertically aligned carbon nanotube-tin oxide core-shell nanowire arrays to manipulate their electrochemical property at the time of synthesis. The vertically-aligned carbon nanotube arrays are synthesized directly on a current collector using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and the tin oxide shell on the carbon nanotubes is synthesized via chemical-solution and vapor deposition routes. The microstructure and the electrochemical properties of the carbon nanotube-tin oxide core-shell nanowires are being investigated by a combination of electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, energy dissipation spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (both in situ and ex situ), charge-discharge measurement, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and in situ transmission electron microscopy observation of the lithiation process. The study provides a better understanding of the lithiation mechanism of the core-shell nanowire array and the influence of their microstructure on their electrochemical properties. The research results provide new insight into the electrochemical process of carbon nanotube-metal oxide composite materials in lithium ion batteries. Graduate and undergraduate students receive research training in advanced electrochemical material synthesis, characterization and design."

With the increasing clinical acceptance of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants, there is an urgent need in the industry to develop low-temperature coating processes. The translated biomimetic coating technology has several distinctive features. First, being a low temperature benign process, it is eminently suitable for coating polymeric substrates such as PEEK implants. Second, the process has the ability to produce carbonated-calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA), similar in composition to bone mineral and a bioactive variation of inert hydroxyapatite. Third, unlike conventional biomimetic processes spanning over several weeks, the deposition of the coating takes place within a relatively short time frame of less than an hour, thus providing the ability for large scale industrial production. All of these features taken together make the technology more versatile than conventional coating processes. This project accomplishes the broad objective of fabricating the coatings and evaluating them for their physical, mechanical, and biomedical properties in vitro and in vivo; data essential to obtain approval from the various regulatory agencies, like the FDA. <br/><br/>This effort is a ""Win-Win"" situation for both the partners: The University of Toledo and Orchid Bio-coat (Orchid) will work with the University of Toledo's Technology Transfer Office to bring the technology to market. The partnership engages Orchid to provide guidance to UT in the overall manufacturing, translation, distribution and further commercialization aspects that will introduce to the market a new generation of bioactive orthopedic implants made out of PEEK. Orchid is one of the nation's largest providers of plasma sprayed coatings on titanium implants with their distribution network all across the globe. However, with the switch from metallic to polymeric implants, UT will be able to provide the ""turn-key"" technology. The potential economic impact is expected to be felt within next three years' time frame, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this orthopedic implant space.<br/><br/>This project has a significant societal impact on the ageing ""Baby Boomers"" and an increasingly active general population. These segments of the society, which are growing at a very fast rate, experience the most musculoskeletal diseases and injuries. This population is expected to require a wide variety of implants. In the U.S., the orthopedic reconstructive device/implant market is presently experiencing an annual growth rate of 12 to 14%, which is even higher than that of the spinal implant market, growing at 10%. This proposal will address this demand by developing improved and novel products with enhanced integration of the implant with the adjoining boney surfaces.

For the case of atoms, the objective is to improve upon existing methods, by greatly increasing the force and the velocity range over which the force is usable. For molecules, it has proven to be extremely difficult to apply standard methods, owing to the relative complexity of the internal quantum structure of molecules. Thus a particular emphasis will be placed on effective schemes for decelerating and cooling molecules, using as a test system the calcium monofluoride molecule, CaF. Optimal approaches will be determined by a combination of numerical modeling and experimental tests using laser beams that contain light at multiple colors simultaneously. The resulting cold atoms and molecules will be investigated using lasers to probe their internal energy structure. The apparatus will also be used to study the interaction of molecules with each other under unusual conditions. There are possible applications to chemical physics, cold plasma formation, electric field calibration, and quantum computation. The project will help train and educate undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses three main motivations: to develop and understand the physics of stimulated optical forces, to achieve large improvements in direct laser slowing and cooling of atomic and molecular beams, and to investigate excited-state structure and dynamics in atomic He and molecular CaF.

The stimulated bichromatic force (BCF) and the newly-proposed polychromatic force (PCF) are rectified coherent optical forces from multi-frequency laser beams that can be hundreds of times stronger than the conventional radiative force. As part of the proposed research, a prototype chirped-BCF decelerator for He will be completed, and a promising new four-color PCF version will be tested and compared with calculations. A similar decelerator will be developed for the CaF molecule, a species that has attracted considerable recent interest as a candidate for direct laser slowing and cooling. For molecules, there is an additional advantage to utilizing coherent optical forces beyond merely increasing the force. Because hundreds of BCF momentum exchanges can occur for each radiative decay event, the BCF can reduce the velocity by hundreds of times more than incoherent radiative forces before the molecule decays into an inaccessible ""dark"" state. Several spectroscopic experiments will be initiated on the resulting cold atoms and molecules, including studies of cold gases of highly-excited Rydberg states of CaF, and precise laser spectroscopy of both He and CaF. The study of cold molecules in Rydberg states is a little-explored topic likely to involve new physical phenomena. Precise spectroscopy of helium will facilitate tests of basic theory and pave the way for future ultra-precise measurements. Novel applications of metastable helium beams will also be explored."

It is well known that UHTC composites such as ZrB2-SiC possess superior oxidation resistance over monolithic ZrB2 and SiC because the composite naturally forms a complex multilayer oxide structure in situ at high temperature. This research is driven by the need to further understand the formation of the complex oxidation resistant oxides in order to further enhance the oxidation resistance of multilayered UHTCs so they can be used in future aerospace vehicles and energy applications. This research will result in a new fundamental understanding of high-temperature oxidation mechanisms that will enable oxidation resistance in multilayered UHTCs processed using spark plasma sintering which are strongly dependent on specific microstructure, geometry, and environmental conditions.

The key to understanding solar variability and its direct impact on the Earth rests with understanding all aspects of these magnetic fields. This is the ?dark energy? problem of solar physics since the magnetic fields lie beyond the resolution limits of current solar telescopes, are obscured by Earth's atmosphere, or hidden by the glare of the solar disk in the outer solar atmosphere. The Sun provides the laboratory where crucial properties of non-linear dynamics in highly ionized magnetic plasma can be observed and understood, and models can be tested and refined. The technology now exists to resolve and measure the Sun?s magnetic fields and how they control the solar atmosphere. All aspects of the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) design are optimized to study these fields in our astrophysical backyard. With it, we will understand the life cycle of magnetic fields, how they are born by dynamo mechanisms, evolve by convective and explosive phenomena, and dissipated by resistive and reconnective magnetic events.<br/><br/>The ATST will be a 4-m aperture, off-axis solar telescope with integrated adaptive optics, low-scattered light, infrared, coronagraphic, and polarimetric capabilities. It will resolve the essential, fine-scale magnetic features and their dynamics that dictate the varying release of energy from the Sun?s atmosphere. The ATST design is optimized (throughput, scattered light and instrumental polarization properties) to make vector magnetograms down to its diffraction limit (0.03 arcseconds at 500 nm). Its collecting area, which is a factor of 16 greater than today?s solar telescopes, will provide the sensitivity to measure both weak fields and rapidly evolving stronger fields. It has a factor of 64 greater collecting area than the largest existing coronagraph, and will provide the sensitivity and coronagraphic capability needed to measure the weak, fine-scale coronal magnetic fields. The new technologies, and our increased awareness of what we know we must learn, make ATST the necessary and logical successor to the solar telescopes built in the 1960s and 1970s, and is a natural complement to space missions such the Solar Dynamics Observatory, STEREO, and Solar Orbiter.<br/><br/>The ATST offers tremendous opportunity for the training of students and recruitment of post-docs and faculty in solar physics who will become users of the ATST and the instrument builders and theoreticians of the future. ATST plans to establish a strong synergy with the education and outreach programs at the collaborating institutions, including programs for the K-12 classroom, internships, public outreach through tours, hands-on exhibits, and displays. The ATST program has and will continue to actively involve large segments of the US and international solar physics community, helping to strengthen solar astronomy programs at universities and national centers."

Here, he was referring to hydrodynamic turbulence, which is the phenomenon one observes on numerous occasions in daily life, particularly when one travels through fluids either in watercraft on the ocean or in airplanes in the atmosphere. Despite its intuitive manifestations, the scientific understanding of turbulence is far from satisfactory. A related phenomenon is ""wave turbulence,"" which pertains to similar problems but for different physical systems involving wave interactions (e.g.,ocean or plasma waves). The aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of certain phenomena pertaining to wave turbulence from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint and thereby to take the first steps towards putting the theory on solid mathematical foundations.<br/><br/>The project addresses two different regimes of long-time behavior for nonlinear dispersive and wave partial differential equations. The first regime can be characterized by ""out-of-equilibrium dynamics,"" in which solutions do not exhibit long-time stability around equilibrium configurations. This is the typical behavior of nonlinear dispersive equations posed on compact domains, where dispersive effects do not translate to decay, and is the natural setting of wave turbulence theory. The other regime of long-time behavior concerns dispersive partial differential equations posed on Euclidean space, for which one can hope to have stable equilibrium points for the dynamics (stationary solutions). The ""asymptotic stability"" of trivial equilibria (zero solutions) is mostly well understood by now, but that of nontrivial stationary solutions is far from settled. The project suggests several avenues of research to improve our understanding in the two aforementioned directions."

The dimension of those systems is proportional to the number of particles involved which can be quite large, up to 10^{25} in some settings. This makes them too complex to analyze and too costly to solve numerically. However a key feature of those large systems is their multiscale nature: It makes the dynamics extremely complex at the microscopic level of an individual particle. But it can also lead to a drastic reduction in the complexity of the system by approximating it at the mesoscopic or macroscopic level with PDE's in lower dimensions; the main difficulty in that case is the study and control of the correlations between particles. A classical example is the usual mean field limit problem for kinetic equations in statistical physics for which the investigator will develop novel techniques in order to handle singular potentials. New extensions will be investigated as well in order to push beyond the classical framework, including bacterial suspensions, mean field games models and applications to social sciences (consensus formation...). The bacterial suspensions under study have a relatively high number density with hence non negligible correlations between the particles or bacteria. The investigator and collaborators introduce a new numerical scheme to calculate those correlations. In the case of mean field games, in addition of ""classical"" interactions between the particles or agents, a control on the dynamics is optimized by a central agent. The usual techniques, propagation of chaos on the joint law for instance, are no more applicable and we develop a new approach, based on the minimization of N and 1 agent energies.<br/><br/>Systems with a very large number of particles are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Indeed depending on the context and the model, the term ""particle"" may represent very different objects; in the scope of this project, a particle could for instance be as ""simple"" as an electron or ion (particles in a plasma), or more complex like a bacteria, an economical or social agent or even a very large structure like a galaxy (dynamics of clusters in astrophysics). Reducing the complexity of such large systems, for instance by approximating them by Partial Differential Equations, is a critical step to be able to use them (numerical simulations...). The project will contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon for a few important applications: the classical framework of statistical physics, suspensions of bacteria with critical density, multi-agent systems in economy and consensus formation. The project also has a direct impact on the education and future careers of graduate students and will also involve undergraduate students."

Heinrich events are interpreted as massive discharges of icebergs calved from the Laurentide Ice Sheet, the ice mass that covered a large share of the North American continent during the last ice age. The climatic context of Heinrich events was global in scale. Identifying these events therefore is an integral part of millennial-scale global climate change. The physical processes that triggered these events remain poorly understood, however. This doctoral dissertation research project will develop high-resolution records of North Atlantic Ocean subsurface water temperature bracketing known Heinrich events using magnesium-to-calcium ratios in seafloor-dwelling organisms in order to evaluate an external triggering mechanism for Heinrich events attributed to changes in oceanic circulation. This approach will employ a new analytical method for Mg-Ca paleothermometry on seafloor-dwelling organisms. Analysis of one ocean sediment core raised from the outer Labrador Sea basin suggested that bottom-water temperatures warmed before stratigraphic signatures of Heinrich events at that core location. Replication and further assessment of the geographic distribution of this pattern is necessary in order to establish its role as a forcing mechanism of Heinrich events. Exploratory data from the Reykjanes Ridge and the Labrador Sea have shown that the ocean sediment cores targeted for this project at the depths and locations of interest contain Heinrich event signatures and material necessary in order to carry out this project's research goals.<br/><br/>The study of abrupt ice sheet destabilization and oceanic change has significant implications for future climate. Confirmation that intermediate-depth ocean warming played a significant role in triggering past ice-sheet instabilities will provide critical insights into potential future behavior of similarly configured Antarctic ice-sheet sectors. The project could provide validation for ice-sheet models currently being developed for projections of land-ice loss and attendant sea level rise. The project also will yield new data to test the accuracy of a new accessory developed by the doctoral student for use with plasma mass spectrometers in order to more effectively measure Mg-Ca paleothermometry in marine sediments. The project should improve understanding of the response of ice sheets to current and possible future changes in ocean circulation and temperature, factors which are among the greatest causes for concern and uncertainty in projections of sea-level rise. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career."

Cell asymmetry is controlled by two mechanisms: cell polarity and cytokinesis. Errors in these events often lead to changes in cell proliferation and growth. The plasma membrane and underlying cell cortex play an important role in cell polarity and cytokinesis, yet very little is known about how it is regulated and maintained during development. To address this issue, the project is focused on the protein dynamin, which has an essential role in both of these events. It is hypothesized that dynamin influences cell polarity and facilitates the temporal and spatial control of the cytokinesis machinery through its role in endocytosis and actin dynamics. This project will employ an interdisciplinary strategy to reveal the role of the dynamin using a combination of genetics, cell and molecular biology and high-resolution, in vivo microscopy techniques.

The PI will focus on understanding the coupling and competing effects from different spatial or temporal scales, among them the microstructures and the macroscopic properties of the solutions, the kinetic transport and the induced elastic stresses in viscoelastic materials, the relative drags and interactions between different species in mixtures. Energetic variational methods have shown promise for the study of such multiscale multiphysics problems, for instance the transport of ionic solutions through biological environments. They deal naturally with systems with many components that flow between fixed and moving domains or boundaries, and with different interactions. We will apply such variational methods to study the transport of biological plasma, ionic solutions of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, and their interaction with different environments and structures."

The most well-known such equations are the KdV equation, the non-linear Schrodinger (NLS) equation, and the sine-Gordon equation (SGE). The KdV and NLS arise naturally from geometric flows and the SGE is the Gauss-Codazzi equation for surfaces in $3$-space with constant negative Gaussian curvature. Many other partial differential equations arising in geometry are also now known to be soliton equations. Terng will study submanifolds in symmetric spaces and in affine flat 3-space whose governing equations are soliton equations or elliptic integrable systems, construct curve flows in Riemannian, pseudo-Riemannian, and affine geometries so that the corresponding equations for curve invariants are soliton equations. Terng will also study the moduli space of the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation. Jointly with B. Dai, and Uhlenbeck, Terng solved the Cauchy problem with small initial data and constructed all soliton space-time monopoles when the gauge group is the unitary group. She proposes to investigate this equation when the gauge group is an arbitrary compact, simple Lie group or the special linear group. <br/><br/>Soliton theory is an enticingly elegant part of modern mathematics. It has a multitude of interpretations in geometry, analysis, algebra, and applied mathematics. The KdV equation models the motion of waves in shallow canal, the NLS equation models the motion of a wave envelope in an optical fiber, and the SGE equation arises in Plasma physics. The existence of particle like soliton solutions of the NLS has helped speed up the internet. Soliton equations also arise as equations for many important geometric problems. Terng plans to study geometric aspects of soliton equations, use techniques in soliton theory to construct new and interesting geometric objects, and use geometry to construct new soliton equations."

Electric field-assisted sintering technology, sometimes called spark plasma sintering, is a novel process for the consolidation of powders or particulates that offers cost advantages over conventional approaches. The team of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project will contribute to the fundamental understanding of molecular diffusion behavior during field-assisted sintering for titanium and titanium powders that will enable cost-effective manufacturing of these materials while maintaining material attributes such as high strength, low density and environmental inertness. The findings will impact both the automotive and aerospace industries.

In the presence of an electric field during field-assisted sintering, the phase equilibrium can be altered giving rise to new phases or eliminating certain phases during processing. The effects of an imposed electric field and microstructural length scale will be assessed through a set of experiments and simulations that will provide insight into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interdiffusion and phase equilibria/transformation for the chosen material system. With this insight, titanium alloys can be designed and manufactured with desired properties at lower cost than is available today."

The results of atomic collisions research are widely used in fields such as plasma physics, astrophysics, biophysics, and many other areas. In addition to providing a better overall understanding of heavy-ion collisions, which is the principal focus of the effort, this work will bring a well-known technique from other areas of physics into atomic and molecular collisions research, and possibly lead to additional overlap and collaborations between the atomic collisions community and other related fields. Another important aspect of this project is the inclusion of undergraduate students in cutting-edge research. By participating in this project, students will gain valuable hands-on research experience through code development and data analysis. They will also present their results at regional and national conferences, which will hopefully give them a more global view of scientific research.<br/><br/>The few-body problem is one of the most fundamental, unsolved problems in physics. When more than two particles interact through the Coulomb force, the dynamics of the system cannot be described exactly. As a result, theory must resort to approximations, and any discrepancies that result between theory and experiment must be a result of the approximations. A comparison of current theoretical models with recent experimental results reveals some striking limitations of the current models. In particular, the dynamics of collisions in which some of the collision fragments are found in a full 3-dimensional geometry is not understood. The underlying mechanism behind these 3-dimensional collisions is known to be a result of quantum mechanical effects, but current theories cannot accurately describe the collision dynamics. The objective of this project is to develop a novel quantum mechanical theoretical model for the study of ion-impact atomic collisions through the use of the path integral technique. The path integral method is a well-known technique used in other areas of physics, but has not been applied to the study of heavy-ion collisions. This particular technique will allow for the inclusion of important quantum mechanical interactions, as well as provide an intuitive understanding of particle trajectories during the collision. <br/><br/>The technical details of the project include the development of a computational model using the path integral method for ionization and capture processes with heavy-ion projectiles. The method will utilize an expansion of the Lagrangian around the classical path, where the deviation from the classical path represents the quantum fluctuations of the particle. For electron capture collisions, the role of the projectile-nuclear interaction and target electron correlation will be studied. Electron capture collisions with high projectile energy and large scattering angle will also be studied with the objective of better understanding the Thomas mechanism, and determining if possible diffraction effects exist in these collisions. For ionization processes, collisions in which the ejected electron is found outside of the scattering plane will be studied, with a focus on projectile-nuclear interactions and the role of close collisions between the projectile and the target nucleus."

A fundamental question is to find the quantities which are conserved by the waves, and this search lies at the heart of the study of integrable systems. The classical integrable Hamiltonian systems, like the KdV equation and the non-linear Schrodinger system, have been playing a fundamental role in physical theories, like the theory of wave interactions, plasma physics, and fiber optics, to name a few. The main goal of the first part of this project is to build up a rigorous theory of integrable systems of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, based on algebraic structures that were inspired by physics. It is expected that the integrable systems discovered as a result of this project will play an important role in the study of various physical phenomena. The second part of this project has its origins in the last letter that Ramanujan wrote to G. H. Hardy in the early 1920's, where he wrote down 17 functions that had never been studied before (and which he named mock theta functions). The second direction of the project is to study the connections of mock theta functions to representation theory. It is expected that this will lead to new types of mock theta functions and to applications in number theory.<br/><br/>Some of the problems to be explored related to the first direction include the following: (a) develop a theory of non-local Hamiltonian structures and corresponding theory of integrable systems, based on the notion of a ''non-local'' Poisson vertex algebra; (b) compute the variational Poisson cohomology for not necessarily quasi-constant coefficient Poisson differential operators, developing the methods of a 2013 paper with De Sole; (c) develop further the theory of the generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies and their Dirac reductions and establish their connection to the Kac-Wakimoto hierarchies. Some of the problems to be explored related to the second direction include the following: (a) compute character formulas for admissible representations of affine Lie superalgebras; (b) find explicit transformation formulas for the corresponding modified non-holomorphic theta-functions, in the spirit of Zwegers; (c) using quantum Hamiltonian reduction, compute modular transformation formulas and fusion rules of new representations of superconformal algebras."

Electrons are ubiquitous in nature. Collisions of electrons with atoms and molecules are essential in biology and chemistry, as well as in technology. Examples of electron-driven phenomena can be found in interstellar chemistry, radiation chemistry, environmental chemistry, stability of waste repositories, plasma processing of materials for microelectronic devices and other applications. A major complication in electron-driven processes is that the in that the states that are involved are meta-stable since they can lose the electron via a process known as autodetachment. Matsika and her research group develop quantum mechanical approaches to treat metastable states and their behavior in electron-driven processes. They apply these methods to better understand DNA damage by radiation.. Low energy electrons can cause DNA strands to break and thus the interaction of low energy electrons with DNA is of major importance. This research will be carried out by a research team involving collaboration of undergraduate and graduate students with postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>Electron-driven processes have several similarities to photo-initiated processes, and progress made by the Matsika group and others in the latter field can be used to enhance the tools available in the former processes. In both photo-initiated and electron-driven phenomena electronically excited states are generated which are far from equilibrium and short lived. Nonadiabatic events are crucial and conical intersections are the rule rather than the exemption in both cases. Specific goals of this work are: 1) Development of efficient multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods for metastable states. The complex absorbing potential (CAP) approach is used in combination with MRCI to obtain both the energies and lifetimes of these states. A combination of conventional MRCI methods and CAP/MRCI are used to study potential energy surfaces, conical intersections, and nonadiabatic events related to resonances. 2) Theoretical studies of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) in nucleobases using the approaches developed in part (1). In order to address DEA in nucleobases the resonances are identified first, followed by explorations of the pathways leading to DEA and the experimentally observed products. The methodology developed will be implemented in publicly available computational software."

In particular, the PI plans to study (1) phase transitions in two-phase viscous fluid flows with variable surface tension and surface viscosity, (2) phase transitions in two-phase viscous fluid flows with kinetic undercooling, and (3) phase transitions driven by chemical potentials. Additional topics to be investigated are (4) evaporation in the presence of surface tension, and (5) stability and instability of solidifying processes in phase transitions. The dynamics of two-phase flows and the motion of their separating interfaces has been a problem of scientific and industrial interest for centuries. In the absence of phase transitions, which means that the interface is advected with the flow, this problem is fairly well understood. However, if phase transitions are present, the resulting models are fundamentally more complex, as they involve the equations of fluid dynamics in conjunction with those of phase transitions. The results anticipated will on the one hand clarify the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and on the other establish qualitative and asymptotic properties of these solutions. The PI proposes a mathematical approach that is general and flexible, and that will open up the treatment of many more problems.<br/><br/>Over the last decades the subject of free boundary problems has attracted increasing attention, both because of its theoretical interest and because of its numerous applications in the natural and engineering sciences. Typically, a free boundary problem consists of one or more partial differential equations that have to be solved in a domain that is a priori unknown and that has to be determined as part of the problem. Free boundary problems are in general harder to solve, both analytically and numerically, than the underlying differential equations would be in a prescribed domain. They have an inherent nonlinear structure, as two separate solutions cannot be superposed. It is not surprising, then, that the variety of applications and the inherent difficulties of solving free boundary problems have initiated a variety of theoretical methods, and in many cases have determined the direction of the development of these methods. Free boundary problems are important in many fields, such as material sciences, fluid mechanics, hydrodynamics, thermo-mechanics, magneto-dynamics, solid-state physics, plasma physics, geology, chemistry, and the biological and medical sciences. Many manufacturing processes in industry lead to free boundary problems, such as electrochemical machining, viscous sintering, the growth of crystals, injection molding processes, etching processes, solidification processes, casting processes, and chemical vapor deposition processes, to mention a few. The appropriate numerical and analytical treatment is a major challenge, both to the engineer and to the mathematician. The proposed work will have an impact for those real-world problems and applications where surface tension cannot be neglected."

This system is expected to be a major improvement in performance and cost over existing multicharged ion sources and will have the ability to select ion charge and kinetic energy over a wide range. Multicharged ions have recently attracted significant attention for use in tools for nanoprocessing and nanofabrication of various electronic devices and sensors. They also have applications in medical imaging and treatment and in chemical analysis. This project integrates a laser multicharged ion source with a cost-effective ion density amplification stage based on a spark discharge. The multicharged ions are selected and transported to a processing chamber. With increased charge state, the ions carry substantial potential energy. The multicharged ion interaction with the solid involves the release of this potential energy in addition to its kinetic energy. For slow multicharged ions, the release of potential energy can be localized to a depth of a few nanometers (10-9 meter) at the surface, making them ideal for nanoprocessing. On the other hand, fast multicharged ion beams can deposit significant energy at a relatively deep target location, making them ideal for applications requiring localized high energy deposition as used in carbon ion radiotherapy. <br/><br/>The multicharged ion source is being developed at the Applied Research Center, which is a consortium of four Virginia universities, the Jefferson Lab, and several industries; all share lab facilities. Old Dominion University (ODU) collaboration with consortium members involves joint use of resources by students, course sharing, and joint publications. Results will be incorporated in several graduate and undergraduate courses in diverse subjects, such as nanotechnology, plasma processing, microelectronic fabrication, statistical process control in semiconductor manufacturing, solid-state electronics, semiconductor characterization, pulsed power, and renewable energy. This project will involve several faculty and graduate students and collaboration with researchers at Universit du Qubec en Outaouais. A user facility will be established for multicharged ion applications. This facility is expected to operate for at least 15 years with 2-5 graduate students continuously using the instrument. Undergraduate students will be involved in this multidisciplinary work as part of their senior design course and in summer projects. ODU is an urban university with a diverse student population, and this instrumentation development project will be particularly useful in attracting underrepresented groups. The multicharged ion technology will be featured in ODU engineering open houses, Jefferson Lab open houses, and the annual Hampton Roads Technology showcase. The development of the spark-assisted laser multicharged ion source will represent a new scientific and industrial tool with many potential applications in various industries, in particular in the emerging nanotechnology industry. ODU will seek industrial partners for licensing patents, know-how transfer to industry, and commercialization."

Professor Almeida will further integrate the research and educational components of this project within a new program designed to improve the quantitative skills of undergraduate students in the STEM fields, especially chemistry, while fostering the connections between biological and physical sciences, as a means of bridging the communication gap between these disciplines. UNCW is a primarily undergraduate institution, where participation of undergraduate students in research is a high priority. What is distinctive in this project for undergraduate education is that it combines a fundamental problem of active research in biophysical chemistry with extensive use of quantitative methods. Undergraduates will be involved early on in their studies, emphasizing learning by doing.<br/><br/>Lipid bilayers composed of sphingomyelin, unsaturated phospholipids, and cholesterol are the simplest model for the lipid component of the outer leaflet of eukaryotic plasma membranes. The interactions of cholesterol with the other lipids are of particular importance,and they remain poorly understood. Membranes of saturated phospholipids and cholesterol have been described as mixtures of liquid ordered and liquid disordered phases. However, no phase separation has been observed in binary mixtures. Alternatively, ordered phospholipids and cholesterol have been proposed to form a ""condensed complex."" The liquid ordered phase would then consist of these complexes. This research seeks to explore an alternative in which the liquid ordered phase is a thermodynamic state of the phospholipid, which is well populated in the presence of cholesterol but rare in its absence. The project is designed to test these competing hypotheses through computer simulations and experimental studies, and to determine the magnitudes of the interactions in lipid mixtures that increasingly mimic the composition of biological membranes."

Those structures consist of gas and stars, many of whose properties are governed by processes involving magnetic fields. This project is a study of such structures in our own Milky Way galaxy using observations at near-infrared wavelengths. Catalogs containing thousands of times more detections than available previously will be produced for general astronomical use and released to the entire scientific community. Three graduate students will be trained in using various aspects of these data to study topics ranging from star formation in the Milky Way to comparing it to the properties of other nearby galaxies like our own. <br/><br/>The Galactic magnetic B-field has barely been characterized and its influence on the interstellar medium (ISM) is poorly known. Comprehensive analysis of the recently completed Galactic Plane Infrared Polarization Survey (GPIPS) data set will provide an important leap forward. This will include quantitative tests of models of the Galactic B-field in the disk as well as identifying the locations and natures of the regions in the disk now seen to exhibit strong departures from the general disk-parallel B-field alignment. Connecting what is seen in the GPIPS data for the Milky Way disk to large-scale B-fields in nearby edge-on galaxies will provide vital context as well as test whether the B-fields traced by synchrotron radio polarization, arising from hot plasma, connect smoothly to the B-fields in the cool, star-forming ISM. Deeper observations of important Galactic regions will answer B-field related questions with milli-parsec resolution in quiescent and star-forming sites and provide key tests of the two B-field model paradigms (strong vs weak fields). Studies resulting from using the Mimir instrument and from GPIPS provide vital B-field context, from the diffuse outer ISM layers of molecular clouds into the dense, core regions. New, K-band Mimir polarimetry of infrared dark clouds and well-known massive cloud core star formation regions will reach deep enough to provide context for the high column density zones observed with millimeter and submillimeter interferometric polarimetry. <br/><br/>GPIPS and Mimir data products have impact outside the study of B-fields in the ISM. Community use of GPIPS data will yield new findings on stars, stellar evolution, star clusters, and Galactic structure and assembly. Project support of GPIPS data products and software ensure their utility and legacy. The program of bringing undergraduate and graduate students to Arizona to operate Mimir on the Perkins telescope for class-based projects will continue and will include high school students participating in BU's RISE summer program. Though modest in numbers (~100 students in 8 years), these trips to the telescope have had profound personal and career impact on the students participating, be they from graduate or undergraduate observational classes or from the introductory, non-majors astronomy courses at BU. Public presentation opportunities at the Boston Museum of Science, BU Astronomy Department?s weekly open nights, and elsewhere will be actively pursued for this project. Finally, three graduate students will complete PhDs and several undergraduates and High School students will gain valuable research experience."

Some of the problems under investigation include fourth-order Monge-Ampere-type equations, nonlocal free boundary and phase transition problems, and degenerate fully nonlinear equations of concave type. One recurrent question is the smoothness of the solutions or their level sets and their behavior near singular points. For example, the project will investigate the smoothness of Lipschitz thin free boundaries and the dimensions of their singular sets, the boundary behavior of solutions of Monge-Ampere equations with degenerate boundary conditions, and the rigidity of level sets in nonlocal phase transitions.<br/><br/>Partial differential equations are used to describe a large variety of physical phenomena. At the same time, they contribute to the development of different branches of mathematics such as differential geometry, topology, probability, and algebraic geometry. In particular, Monge-Ampere equations occur naturally in the mathematical formulation of optimal transportation problems, many of them within the realm of our daily lives: traffic network planning in cities, internet traffic optimization, blood vessel branching in the human venous system, and meteorological fluid dynamics. Such equations also frequently turn up in other areas of mathematics, like Riemannian or conformal geometry. Nonlocal free boundary and phase transition problems appear in several areas of science, including fluid mechanics, plasma physics, and semiconductor theory. Thin free boundaries are relevant to our understanding of flame propagation and also in the propagation of surfaces of discontinuities.

For example, hamsters prefer to increase food hoarding rather than food intake in response to famine. Animals with these adaptations are likely to have an evolutionary advantage, especially in environments where food is scarce. In rodents, neural circuits in the brain that control feeding behavior develop during the last half of gestation, making maternal nutrition crucial during late pregnancy. In fact, maternal energy availability during pregnancy directly influences the development of offspring neural and hormonal machinery. However, we know very little about the mechanisms responsible for these developmental changes, especially in food hoarding animals. This work will contribute to the broad understanding about the effects of maternal nutrition on neural and hormonal mechanisms that regulate feeding, providing insight into feeding strategies adopted by offspring in response to variations in predicted postnatal environment. The educational activities integrate research and teaching efforts, develop a new major program in Neuroscience and provide a resource website for information about the PI's research and teaching.<br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental questions essential for understanding how gestational nutrient availability affects offspring ingestive behavior. Ingestive behavior consists of two phases: 1) the appetitive phase, consisting of foraging and food hoarding, and 2) the consummatory phase consisting of actual food ingestion. The consummatory phase (food intake) is well studied in rats and mice. The appetitive phase, however, has received comparatively little attention, even though those behaviors are common to most animals including humans. Unlike rats and mice, hamsters use appetitive behaviors extensively in their ingestive behavioral repertoire, and they use information about internal and external sources (i.e. both body fat and food hoards) of metabolic fuels to maintain energy balance. In addition, hamsters prefer to increase food hoarding rather than food intake during energetic challenges to maintain homeostasis. Preliminary data from this model indicate that male hamsters exposed to gestational nutrient restriction have increased food intake and reduced food hoarding, along with increases in plasma insulin, abdominal fat and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y, while females appear to be largely unaffected. These unique sexually differentiated findings, along with the lack of previous attention to gestational programming of appetitive ingestive behaviors increase the likelihood that the proposed experiments will make significant contributions to the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology. The broader impacts of this project include enhanced undergraduate student mentoring in research, development of a new laboratory course that integrates peer review and publication components, resources for a new Neuroscience major with an integrated K-12 outreach and development of a website describing the curricular innovations and neuroscience research at both general and detailed levels"

This project will answer fundamental questions about the QGP, such as how matter is transformed from a collection of protons and neutrons to a free state where quarks and gluons can travel through space unhindered, much like they did in the primordial soup of matter following the Big Bang. Experiments will be carried out at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located in Geneva, Switzerland. In order to look for signatures of how the transition to the QGP phase has occurred for a given beam energy, the Ohio State group will study the numbers of particles produced in the collisions along with the distribution and correlations of particle momenta. <br/><br/>The goals for the high-energy program are three-fold. Firstly, to study the space-time properties of this extremely dense matter created in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. The second is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory of the Strong interaction between quarks and gluons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies, to probe the transition(s) between confined and deconfined matter. In particular, the group will perform a novel analysis as a function of the collision energy, measuring coordinate-space anisotropies and dynamics. Thirdly, they will take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions, and apply them to proton- proton collisions at similar energies. They will look particularly for collective behavior (flow) in these collisions. If the initial reports of such flow in high-energy p+p collisions are confirmed at higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial self-interacting state, itself. In addition, there are broader impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education, technology and computing."

However, compressibility and shocks play a critical role in many practical applications. Some examples are understanding the behavior of plumes in volcanic eruptions, design of more efficient fuel pellets for inertial confinement fusion, fragmentation of gallstones or kidney stones by shock waves, and development of energy-efficient scramjet engines. Understanding the mixing process in such complex flows presents a set of truly fundamental and open problems of in fluid mechanics that still remain to be solved. This CAREER project advances our knowledge precisely in this context, which can then be applied to these practical applications. The scientific goal of the CAREER project is to produce, diagnose, and simulate shock-driven turbulent flows in a compressible system. The system decouples hydrodynamic instabilities from the effects of radiation and plasma. The approach is to use a newly built variable-inclination shock tube with 11.5cm  11.5cm square inner cross-section, equipped with the state-of-the-art laser diagnostics (3D Particle Image Velocimetry, Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence, as well as Rayleigh-Scattering), to answer critical scientific questions associated with shock-driven variable-density flows in configurations and regimes which have not yet been explored.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This research will quantify the effects of initial conditions (single and multimode), incident shock wave Mach numbers (M), and density contrast on the perturbation growth and mixing rate, as well as to determine the existence of self-similar scaling laws and the critical value of Reynolds number and length scales necessary for transition to occur in these extreme mixing environments. Experiments conducted as part of this project will provide the first detailed turbulence statistics measurements (i.e., Reynolds stresses, density-velocity correlations and their spectra) for shock-accelerated variable density flows at M > 2.0 and will inform physics-based models used in simulations by testing them under more realistic conditions. This research will help develop the capability to accurately predict and model extreme mixing, potentially leading to advances in a number of fields: energy, environment (atmospheric and oceanographic), aerospace engineering, chemical processing, homeland security and, most pertinently, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The integrated Education Plan will engage first-generation college students in experimental design and operation, support a woman graduate student to work on the proposed research, and use visualization and team-based approaches to improve students' understanding of concepts and promote communication and teamwork skills that are vital to success. The involvement of first generation students in research will lead to enhanced retention and success rates for these students in the department. An applet-based visual learning environment will enhance learning and retention of the material presented in class by allowing students to observe the dynamic phenomena and explore the effects of varying a parameter on the resulting solution. To increase awareness among the general public about shock-driven flows and their potential applications, we plan to work with a local high school teacher to create informational videos about our research and experimental facilities, post them on YouTube, and make them available to teachers for use in the classroom."

This blood typing microdevice has the following unique features: portability, rapid ABO-Rh type identification, no reagents, simultaneous hematocrit determination, and small blood volumes. These features provide the following advantages: time- and cost-savings, increased efficiency, longer shelf life, and better reliability when compared to paper-based blood agglutination kits, the leading competitor in this market space. While most electrokinetic/microfluidic devices fit on handheld microscope slides, the supporting infrastructure to operate the device comprises a considerable cost and space footprint. This project addresses this technology gap by developing sensing electrodes to replace the optical microscope?s role of recording red blood cell responses in the microdevice, facilitating a key step in the transition from research discovery toward a user-friendly commercial application. <br/><br/>This blood typing microdevice is important because trauma centers and hospitals rely extensively on blood donations provided by blood banks across the U.S to save lives. There are currently 84 million blood typings per year in the U.S., with approximately 16 million donations annually. Processing costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) would result in significant savings and bolster our declining blood supply. This portable technology could also be translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications. In addition, the potential initial economic impact is expected to be up to $12 million per year, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in healthcare including trauma, blood therapies, and surgeries."

Broadly speaking, the goal is to improve our understanding of nonlinear interactions in the context of wave-like phenomena. Equations of interest include wave equations, the Schroedinger equations and KdV type equations, as well as physically relevant coupled systems such as Einstein's equations, water waves, Maxwell systems and the Chern-Simons-Schroedinger model.<br/><br/>While most of the work will be concerned with nonlinear problems, one cannot obtain good nonlinear results without having a good understanding of the underlying linear dispersive dynamics. The two main themes here are (i) boundary value problems and (ii) global in time dispersion on curved backgrounds. The latter topic is mainly oriented toward systems, e.g. the Maxwell system and the spin two wave equation; this is related to the study of the conjectured stability of the Schwarzchild and Kerr black holes in the context of the Einstein equations in general relativity.<br/><br/>On the nonlinear side, a key topic to be explored is that of large data solutions in energy critical semilinear dispersive equations. The first stage involves understanding and classifying possible obstructions (e.g. solitons, steady states, self-similar solutions) to global scattering solutions. In the absence of such obstructions the goal is to obtain global well-posedness and scattering. Another goal is to achieve a good understanding of the dynamics near these obstructions.<br/><br/>The study of short and long term dynamics in quasilinear dispersive equations is another main theme of this proposal. There are several models of interest, namely nonlinear wave equations (in particular Einstein's equations), nonlinear Schroedinger equations as well as some water wave models.<br/><br/>Although the proposed work is primarily theoretical, many of the problems have their origin in physical theories such as general relativity, many body quantum field theory, surface wave propagation and plasma physics. As such, it is hoped that the results of the research may shed some light on the corresponding physical phenomena. Two good examples in this directions are the black hole stability question in general relativity, as well as the long range propagation of water waves.<br/><br/>On the human resource side, the project involves a good number of graduate students (six at present), as well as postdocs (five for the first year of the project, including three NSF postdocs). It also involves many collaborators at various institutions, both domestic and abroad.

The main physics program supported by this grant is to measure how quarks are distributed in nucleons and in particular how the magnetic moments of quarks are aligned compared with the nucleon?s overall magnetic moment. Measurements over the past decade have shown that the quarks contribute only about 1/3 of the total spin of the nucleon, which gives rise to prediction that a significant fraction comes from the orbital motion of the quarks and other sources. The goal of these experiments is to compare results on the quark distributions (and their orbital motion) with theoretical predictions from the so-called Standard Model of Particle Physics. Additional measurements to search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron, which would be a signal of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the properties of the elementary particles making up most of the visible matter in the universe, are also part of this project.

The research will be performed at four experiments: SeaQuest at Fermilab, PHENIX at Brookhaven, and COMPASS-II and ATLAS at CERN. The strong force also played a role at the beginning of time. In the early stages of the big bang, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) existed for an instant, before the strong force confined the quarks into bound states. This fleeting state of matter has been recreated in the laboratory and found to possess extraordinary properties, such as a viscosity so low that it may be at its theoretical minimum. This grant enables continued study of the QGP?s properties using fully reconstructed jets at ATLAS and correlations in small collision systems at PHENIX. This award also supports a search for a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron, a CP-violating quantity. The nEDM experiment aims at a 100-fold improvement over the present upper limit of the EDM set by previous experiments."

The foundational knowledge gained from this project will stimulate the transition from current cooling equipment of power plants to this unique and novel technology. The substantial water saving will help relieve the water crisis facing US and the world. By active dissemination of the fundamental findings, it will offer the scientific community a unique understanding of effectively cooling large scale power plant units in an efficient environment-friendly, and sustainable way. <br/><br/>In this research, novel heat-pipe condensers cooled by on-demand sweat-boosted air cooling will be developed to achieve unprecedented cooling capability and substantially reduce the size and footprint of air-cooled condensers (ACC), with a minimal penalty in power production. This can be achieved by innovatively engineering phase change heat transfer to drastically enhance three major heat transfer processes in ACC. Specifically, heat acquisition will be enhanced by dropwise condensation on robust Nickel alloy coatings created by atmospheric plasma spray (APS); temperature difference can be significantly reduced by highly conductive heat pipes (as the condenser core) enabled by novel hybrid microscale wick structures; and the heat rejection process will be dramatically enhanced by devising sweat-evaporation that mimics the primary mechanism of mammals to effectively dissipate heat during physical exercise. Novel nanowicks will be developed from functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to realize evaporation and create durable self-cleaning coatings. The heat and mass transfer on micro/nano-engineered surfaces will be experimentally and numerically studied. Component level models will be integrated in a Virtual Test Bed (VTB) to achieve high fidelity modeling of ACCs and power plants.

As a magnetic star, our Sun has disrupted, and will continue to threaten disrupting, these technology-dependent activities. In order to mitigate the inevitable risks, it is vital that we advance our understanding of the processes behind events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CME). The solar magnetic field that underlies all of these phenomena arises from the flows present in the solar plasma. These flows are produced by the transport of energy through the solar interior. This 3-year research project is expected to improve our knowledge of the structure, dynamics and flows immediately below the surface of the Sun. This region is key to understanding and predicting solar activity. This research project features not only important academic research, but also promises a tangible and concrete benefit to our technologically powered society.<br/><br/>This 3-year project is aimed at a better characterization of the Sun's near-surface layers (outermost 5% of the solar interior) using helioseismic techniques. A key question that this work will contribute to answering is: how and why does the Sun (and other Sun-like stars) vary? Using helioseismology, the project team will be able to infer and constrain changes in the structure and dynamics of the solar interior by extending the precise characterization of p-mode (or pressure-mode) oscillations to higher spatial degrees and tracking their changes with time. The technical aspect of this project is to derive accurate characteristics of high-degree modes, i.e., precise and unbiased estimates of mode frequency, line width, asymmetry and amplitude for spherical harmonics degrees in the range 200-900, using NSO's Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) observations. The research work to be carried out would enhance the scientific return of the GONG mission, which has been supported by the NSF.

Non-migrating tides are pervasive and known to occur in neutral winds, temperature, neutral density, and ionospheric parameters such as plasma densities and electric fields. They manifest themselves in longitude and local time variability, which recent observations from ground and space have shown to be significant. Based on these new findings, significant non-migrating tidal variations may also be present in thermospheric composition and in the infrared emission of energy to the lower atmosphere and to space. This variability will affect the ionosphere-thermosphere system in various ways, including its photochemistry, energy budget, and neutral-plasma coupling. The investigation will examine the tidal variability in [O]/[N2] column density ratio and in nitric oxide and carbon dioxide volume emission rates of energy, connect it quantitatively with the tides in temperature and winds and provide an assessment of the relative importance for neutral-plasma coupling and the thermospheric energy budget as function of season and solar cycle. Towards this goal, the project will synergistically employ data from the GUVI and SABER instruments on the TIMED satellite and an existing, observation-based model of temperature and wind tides in the thermosphere. GUVI will provide the [O]/[N2] column density and SABER nitric oxide and carbon dioxide volume emission rates of energy emitted at 5.3 microns and 15 microns, respectively. The project will support a Ph.D. student and involve summer undergraduate students in the research. Non-migrating tides largely originate in the troposphere as heat is released by evaporation and condensation near the surface. The effects to be investigated are thus a measure for the geospace response to tropospheric weather and how energy and momentum are transported from the lower into the upper atmosphere. The study will provide observational constraints for an important neutral-plasma coupling process, tidal [O]/[N2] variations, that is predicted by current mechanistic and first principles models. It will provide first insight into the weather impact on Earth's ""natural thermostat"", the nitric oxide 5.3 micron emissions, by which heat and solar energy are efficiently lost from the thermosphere to space and to the lower atmosphere."

The purpose is to explore efficiencies in the management of these arrays and optimize resources by designing a shared framework for integrated data storage, archiving, dissemination, and high-level data products. Since these independent arrays observe different portions of Earth's space environment (Earth-space), their further development and integration has potential for providing a powerful tool for synthesizing information about its global dynamics. The planned shared framework will be separate from the scientific research, proposed and performed by individual investigator teams, and thus will provide much needed continuity for funding the instrumentation and data distribution during lapses in individual research funding. The effects of these interruptions are compounded because observations from these magnetometer arrays are used by the broader research community and in international collaborations, in addition to their use in scientific research by the magnetometer teams, themselves. Efficiencies in the operation and maintenance of ground-based magnetometer arrays as well as in the development of new global high-level data products will strengthen and improve a valuable U.S. infrastructure for exploring Earth-space and understanding its long-term evolution. <br/><br/>Ground-based magnetometers make use of signatures in the Earth's magnetic field to explore and understand Earth-space. These signatures provide information about ionospheric currents associated with geomagnetic storms and substorms, the magnetosphere's response to interplanetary shocks, the reconfiguration of currents and convection as the solar wind driving changes, and the propagation of energy through Earth-space carried by long-period plasma waves. They provide the longest record of Earth-space observations and thus are key to our understanding of long-term variations in that environment. Magnetometer arrays are supported and maintained by countries all over the world so the US arrays contribute valuable information to synthesizing an understanding of the global dynamics in Earth-space. Efficiencies in operations and maintenance of these arrays are important to enable the continuing support and further development of this valuable national observing capability."

The DIME (Double-probe Instrumentation for Measuring Electric-fields) CubeSat concept builds on and further develops the NSF-funded Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment (DICE) project aimed at measuring major space weather disturbances in the upper atmosphere. DICE was one of the first NSF CubeSat missions to be selected and flown. The DICE project consisted of two CubeSats weighing less than 2.2 kg each. They were launched into a low Earth orbit in October 2011 and collected data in space for two years. Each DICE satellite carried a suite of three scientific instruments. However, only two of them functioned successfully in space. Due to difficulties accurately controlling the spin of the spacecraft on orbit it was not possible to deploy the long wire booms that made up the electric field instruments. Thus, the DICE spacecraft could not provide measurements of the electric field. Fulfilling the need for continuous global measurements of this critical parameter in upper atmosphere dynamics remains a key goal and challenge for aeronomy and space weather research. The goal of the DIME project is to continue the development of an innovative approach to space-based measurement of the electric field. Leveraging the successes and lessons learned from the DICE mission DIME is envisioned as the next generation low cost, highly capable ionospheric sensor-sat observatory. New developments include improvements in the spin stabilization and control of the CubeSat, as well as improvements to the DICE electric field deployment mechanism. The DIME development so far has been funded under the Air Force SBIR program but falls short of delivering a fully equipped satellite that is ready to be launched and provide scientific data. Support for the purchase of the remaining parts and completion of the full flight assembly of the DIME CubeSat, and also for the completion of the satellite functional testing and calibration, while the present workforce and expertise is in place is the subject of this RAPID award. Delivery of a fully launch-ready DIME CubeSat, will enlist support from the Air Force for the launch and operation on orbit of the satellite. A newly graduated engineer, who worked as a student on the DICE project, in collaboration with a postdoctoral researcher, who with this project is offered a unique experimental research opportunity, will carry out most of the work under this effort. The project also continues to foster valuable collaboration between industry, academia, and government, involving ASTRA (a small business), the Air Force Research Laboratory, and Utah State University. <br/><br/>There are three fundamental drivers of global ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) behavior: solar UV/EUV radiation, high latitude forcing from solar wind-magnetosphere interaction and coupling to the ionosphere and thermosphere, and forcing by waves and tides from the lower atmosphere. While the principles of IT behavior are generally accepted, a complete understanding of the fully coupled ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere system requires extensive measurements of environmental parameters that are not currently available. What are needed are simultaneous multipoint measurements of the electric field in the ionosphere. Focus here is on the high latitude forcing. While E-field measurements have been available from NSF-funded ground-based radars and the DMSP satellites, there is insufficient data to enable a comprehensive specification of the key high latitude potential pattern, electric fields, and their variability in space and time. The DIME sensor-sat has a unique potential to be a pathfinder that will pave the way for low-cost, very capable, next generation space weather CubeSat platforms from which to observe the system-driving electric field and other parameters in the Earth?s ionosphere. Future constellations of DIME platforms could provide networked, global measurements of the electric field. The DIME design additionally includes instrumentation to provide complementary magnetic field and plasma parameter measurements. In this way, DIME constitutes a key step in enabling large-return Geospace science missions using CubeSat technologies, targeting outstanding unanswered system-science and space weather questions."

The project will result in a higher quality coatings (less stress, higher density, better adhesion) broadly impacting many different industries and research areas- from consumer items (razor blades) to energy production (photovoltaics) to semiconductors (displays) to decorative coatings (bathroom faucets). The advantage of the innovation is the way the new magnetic field is generated, using only permanent magnets, and the whole assembly can fit into the standard design of magnetrons where conventional magnet assemblies are positioned. These features will allow easy adoption in the market place and will allow HPPMS to be used in a cost-effective manner compared to the standard magnet packs currently in use. <br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. This new magnetic field topology works better than current magnetic fields because it allows plasma to expand further from cathode and provides a less steep potential drop. With this new electric field orientation, ionized sputtered material is more directed towards substrate to be coated and utilized for film deposition in larger quantities than with the conventional magnetic field configuration. The average incident atom energy is also increased, further improving film densification and making the HPPMS technique more attractive for thin-film coatings. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, will receive technology translation experiences through seeing this invention turn into a commercial product.<br/><br/>The project engages Starfire Industries Inc., a small business specializing in bridging the ""valley of death"" to take the design which works in the research lab and turn it into a manufacturable product, and the Kurt J.

Key features of the atomic high magnetic field sensor are: (1) since the invariable response of atoms is used for the field detection, the operation of these sensors is intrinsically calibration- and drift-free, (2) the sensors exhibit high precision and a large measurement range, (3) metallic components that may be problematic with sensing magnetic fields are not present in the sensor head (all-optical signal readout), (4) the sensors have high-spatial-resolution imaging capability, and (5) the sensors are immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) effects. High magnetic fields in the range of 1-100 Tesla are becoming increasingly important in science and engineering settings. There is growing demand for such fields at university laboratories and government-funded research facilities around the world, and for use in improved industrial processing techniques. In medicine, strong magnets continue to drive improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) products and systems. Advances in high-magnetic-field science and applications continue to benefit directly from improvements in the detection and control of strong magnetic fields, driving demand for devices capable of sensing and measurement in different high-magnetic-field environments with ever-more stringent requirements on the device?s performance capabilities. <br/><br/>It is planned to develop a high-magnetic-field sensor with a sensor head that is electrode-free, metal-free, and based on atomic spectroscopy. The response of the Rydberg atoms to the fields to be measured is detected using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), a quantum-optics method that allows all-optical measurements of Rydberg energy levels without need for vacuum systems and particle detectors. Much of the infrastructure required for measuring strong magnetic fields using Rydberg-atom EIT (lasers, electronics, data acquisition and processing) is already present in the laboratory from previous work. The team has already prepared a setup consisting of strong permanent magnets (field about one Tesla) surrounding the spectroscopic cell. The testing will include the useful field range, the resolution and accuracy, and the detection bandwidth. It is planned to perform one or two test runs within a strong superconducting magnet that can provide 6 to 9 Tesla of magnetic field. The team believes that the sensor technology to be developed can have distinct competitive advantages over current sensors on the market. The potential contribution of the work to science, scientific applications and eventually to the market is the development of atomic sensors for strong-magnetic-field measurement and imaging applications, with performance characteristics that address limitations of existing high-magnetic-field sensor and measurement technologies. The potential customers include national laboratories with high-magnetic-field capabilities and detection needs, such as particle colliders, plasma physics labs, and the National High Magnetic Field Lab, industrial materials manufacturers, medical MRI research and development centers, and electromagnetic compliance (EMC)/EMI testing laboratories in the aerospace, automotive, and defense industries."

This is a project to investigate the scientifically and societally important issue of radiation belt electron dynamics. The emphasis in this research will be on understanding the losses of electrons that occur during magnetic storms. These are significant in that the flux of relativistic electrons decreases by an order of magnitude in a few hours. There are two possible explanations for this: One is loss to the solar wind through the magnetopause and the other is loss to the atmosphere due to precipitation. The former is relatively easy to evaluate but the latter is much more difficult because the loss cone is small in the magnetosphere and because satellite observations provide a limited picture. This proposal will apply a creative approach combining satellite observations from the Van Allen Probes and NOAA POES satellites and a new Drift-Diffusion simulation to quantify the losses. The team will start by determining which observed events are candidates for magnetopause loss, which are candidates for precipitation loss and which are combinations of both types of loss. Then they will use the observations and the simulation iteratively to improve the simulation. They will determine the pitch angle diffusion coefficients as a function of magnetic local time and from that the local time and L shell (radial) dependence of the plasma waves responsible for the precipitation. They will compare this with Van Allen Probes wave observations.

Sphingolipids also act as dynamic regulators of basic cellular processes, including programmed cell death (PCD), which is triggered by the accumulation of the bioactive sphingolipid metabolites long-chain bases and ceramides. The project is designed to elucidate the regulatory components and their interactions that finely mediate the requirements for sufficient amounts of sphingolipids to support cell viability and growth yet prevent the buildup of sphingolipid metabolites to levels that induce PCD. The project will build upon emerging evidence for post-translational regulation of sphingolipid synthesis through serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the first step in this pathway. Arabidopsis homologs of new players in the SPT regulatory network will be characterized. These include small subunits of SPT (ssSPT) that stimulate SPT activity and ORMs that provide reversible negative-regulation of SPT activity in response to intracellular sphingolipid levels. Contributions of members of Arabidopsis ssSPT and ORM gene families to the regulation of SPT and sphingolipid synthesis will be determined. Using yeast-based tools, post-translational modifications of Arabidopsis ORMs will be assessed and interactions of SPT and regulatory proteins will be determined. Experiments will also be conducted to identify any additional components of the SPT regulatory system. Results from the yeast-based studies will provide the basis for experiments designed to uncover the in planta transduction of SPT regulation in response to perturbations in sphingolipid homeostasis. These studies will take advantage of Arabidopsis mutants with dysfunctions in sphingolipid biosynthetic regulation and fungal mycotoxins that generate enhanced levels of PCD-inducing long-chain bases. Elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for controlling the synthesis of sphingolipids will not only have implications for crop productivity but will also be of broad general interest since sphingolipids are both essential and highly bioactive in all eukaryotic cells.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The project encompasses graduate and undergraduate training and high school educational outreach. The research will be conducted by graduate students at University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). Opportunities for an annual two-to-four week exchange of graduate students between UNL and USUHS will broaden training experiences for student participants. To meet a growing educational need at UNL, a graduate level, team-taught course in lipid biochemistry will be established under the leadership of PI Cahoon and co-PI Stone. This course will include modules on sphingolipid function and metabolism and will broadly engage students with interests ranging from nutrition, biofuels, and lipid signaling. Undergraduate training will be incorporated into the project through the UNL Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences (UCARE) program that provides a two year opportunity for undergraduate students to develop and conduct independent research projects. Undergraduate training in line with the project goals will also be provided through established NSF REU programs at UNL and science and technology mentorship programs at USUHS, which actively recruit women and underrepresented minority students.

The principal investigators are T. J. Humanic and M. A. Lisa, of the Department of Physics at The Ohio State University. Our goals for the high-energy program are threefold. Firstly, we will study the space-time properties of the extremely dense matter created at in collisions between heavy nuclei at the highest achievable energies. It is believed that this matter is a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), characterized by colored degrees of freedom at the microscopic scale. The second activity is to study the bulk phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), believed to be the correct theory of the Strong interaction between partons. This will be achieved by varying the conditions of the collision to lower energies, to probe the transition(s) between confined and deconfined matter. In particular, we plan to perform a novel analysis as a function of the collision energy, measuring coordinate-space anisotropies and dynamics. Thirdly, we will take the tools developed to study bulk physics in heavy ion collisions, and apply them to hadronic(p+p) collisions at similar energies. We will look particularly for collective behaviour(flow) in hadronic collisions. If our initial reports of such flow in ultrarelativistic p+p collisions are confirmed at higher energies, this raises important issues about the nature of flow, and the nature of the initial self-interacting state, itself. In the present grant ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions will be studied with Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and with Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. RHIC started delivering Au-Au collisions in Summer 2000, and the LHC, which is the highest energy heavy ion accelerator now in operation, began delivering Pb-Pb collisions at the end of 2010. In order to look for signatures that a phase transition to Quark Matter has taken place, one must study the properties of the particles produced in the collisions, such as particle momenta and multiplicities of each type that can be detected (e.g. pions, kaons, protons, and more exotic particles). This will be done at both RHIC and the LHC using the large acceptance detectors available in the STAR and ALICE experiments, respectively, which can sample most of the interesting particles per collision. The information obtained in this way can be used to determine, for example, the physical size of the interaction region (using two-particle interferometry), the temperatures reached in the collisions (from particle momentum distributions) and exotic particle production such as strange baryons.<br/><br/>Besides the intellectual merit described above, there are broader impacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education, technology and computing. Since undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will play key roles in this project, training will be provided to these groups in how to carry out research in large collaborations and in general problem solving skills. Since this research requires large-scale computing in order to acquire and analyze data on the teraflop and terabyte scale, new methods in information science, such as computing grid systems, will be developed, which can enhance the computing power of society as a whole."

Fundamental information generated will be used to establish the relationship between nanostructuring characteristics, thermal stability, phase transformations, and mechanical response in beta-Ti alloys. Microstructure characterization studies using advanced diagnostic techniques (i.e., SEM, TEM), will provide an understanding of the effect of the mechanical alloying, SPS and severe plastic deformation (ECAP/HPT) processing on nanostructural features, and furthermore understanding of fundamental phenomena (e.g., thermal stability, phase transformations and mechanical behavior) associated with nanostructuring in beta-Ti alloys. Mechanical behavior will be studied to establish the relationship between nanostructural features and mechanical response (i.e., elastic modulus, strength, ductility) in nanostructured beta-Ti alloys. Implementation of in-situ SEM and TEM mechanical characterization will provide direct observation of the dynamic deformation and microstructural changes in nanostructured beta-Ti alloys.<br/><br/>Non-Technical Summary:<br/>Ti alloys are of scientific and technological interest, and in particular nanostructured beta-Ti alloys may exhibit a high strength with low elastic modulus, which are very attractive for biomedical applications, for example.

The principal methods of this work come from the soliton theory. Solitons are very special solitary waves (""bumps"") of water that move with constant speed without any deterioration in their shape. The first soliton siting was described in 1834 by the Scottish naval architect John Scott Russell, who noticed this wave in a channel and pursued it on his horse for quite a while. The soliton theory was originated in the mid-1960s from the fundamental Gardner-Greene-Kruskal-Miura discovery of the inverse scattering transform (IST) for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for shallow water waves (this equation happens to describe the channel phenomenon that Russell observed). Soon thereafter different versions of IST were found for many other physically important nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) referred to as completely integrable systems. Being conceptually similar to the Fourier transform, the IST has yielded a tremendous amount of information about completely integrable systems, far beyond what standard PDE techniques may offer. Soliton theory is regarded as a major achievement of the 20th century science connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical physics with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. Much of work in soliton theory has been done on the propagation of waves initiated by rapidly decaying or periodic initial data (the so-called classical data). The corresponding solutions have a relatively simple and well understood wave structure of running solitons accompanied by radiation of decaying waves, or periodic wave-trains and their modulations. However any deviation from classical data meets principal difficulties that are yet to be surmounted. The project will focus on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much broader than classical. We expect new types of solutions with much more complicated wave structure and far-reaching practical applications. It is expected that the results could be used for understanding rogue waves, soliton propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves, certain meteorological phenomena (e.g. morning glory), or for the study of propagation of coherent structures in noisy media in such diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences, nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc.<br/><br/>In the context of the KdV equation the principal investigator has reformulated the classical IST in terms of Hankel operators and Titchmarsh-Weyl m-functions that let one extend the IST to a surprisingly broad class of initial data. This was achieved by employing some subtle properties of the m-function and deep results from the theory of Hankel operators. The principal investigator plans to use powerful methods of Hankel operators to identify the broadest possible class of initial profiles for which a suitable analog of the IST exists. Another objective is asymptotic analysis of the underlying solutions. The well-known powerful machinery of the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem breaks down on such initial profiles in a number of serious ways. The main thrust will be put on understanding how to make the Riemann-Hilbert problem work far outside of the realm of classical problems. The results are expected to be instrumental for various applications. The accompanying mathematical problems are also very important to the theory of the Schrodinger operator, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, and the theory of Hankel and Toeplitz operators, fundamental objects of operator theory. Uncovering connections between soliton theory and Hankel operators theory is of great independent interest and could potentially have a profound influence on both theories. The project will have a very large educational component. The principal investigator is committed to continuing his research experience for undergraduates program on nonlinear wave phenomena to identify and mentor young scholars in the field of applied mathematics. It is his intent to attract a diverse (gender, ethnicity, disability) group of talented undergraduates into the program to broaden the participation of underrepresented in the mathematical sciences groups."

In recent years, this targeted killing capacity has emerged as a core component of several promising immunotherapeutic strategies to fight cancer. A better understanding of how cytotoxic T cells operate is therefore not only of biological interest but also of potential clinical relevance. T cells kill by first forming a close cell-cell interface, called an immunological synapse, with their targets. They then secrete a mixture of toxic proteins into the synapse, which damage the target's plasma membrane and intracellular contents. Recent biophysical studies have indicated that T cells exert a substantial amount of mechanical force across the synapse, which could potentially alter the shape and physical properties of the target cell. The experiments in this research will investigate the hypothesis that these forces boost killing by enhancing the activity of the toxic proteins secreted into the synapse. The idea that mechanical force and chemical signals cooperate in this manner is quite unappreciated and could represent an important new concept in the understanding of intercellular communication and immune function. The principal investigator will also develop a paid summer internship program in mechanobiology targeting female students at both the high school and university levels to provide them an entryway into a research career.<br/><br/>The studies will focus on potential synergy between synaptic forces and the secreted cytolytic molecule perforin, which forms proteinaceous pores on the target cell membrane. Preliminary results suggest that synapse formation increases target cell membrane tension, thereby potentiating perforin pore formation. Biophysical methods will be merged with immunological assays in order to investigate this hypothesis. Polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates will be used to explore the relationship between target cell tension and perforin pore formation. Optical trap methodology will be used to quantify the effects of synapse formation on membrane tension. Finally, polydimethylsiloxine micropillar arrays will be used to examine the spatiotemporal coordination of force exertion and perforin secretion. The successful completion of these research goals could establish mechanopotentiation (i.e. the synergy between physical and chemical signals) as an important avenue for intercellular communication, which would broadly influence current conceptions and future studies of cell-cell interactions and mechanobiology."

The inside of the cell has a different concentration of charged molecules from the outside of the cell, resulting in an electric field across the membrane that changes its mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of the cell membrane have a profound effect upon how the cell functions. The research will determine by experiment how the mechanical properties of a cell membrane change as the result of exposure to electrical fields. The results of the experiments will be modeled using the engineering methods of 'shell theory' which can model the effects of the curvature of a thin material on its mechanical properties.<br/><br/>An electric potential difference across the plasma membrane is common to all living cells and is essential to physiological functions such as generation of action potentials for cell-to-cell communication. While the basics of cell electrical activity are well established (e.g. the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential), the coupling between voltage and membrane deformation has received limited attention. To fill this void, a combined theoretical and experimental study of biomimetic membranes in externally applied electric fields will be studied. Specifically, the research seeks to determine the relation between membrane voltage, membrane properties such as bending rigidity, tension, and spontaneous curvature, and membrane shape. The project integrates theory and experiment to analyze both the small thermally-driven bilayer undulations and the large buckling-like deformations in an applied electric field. The transformative impact of the project lies in its pioneering research of the dynamic coupling between shape and voltage of biomembranes; our findings will uncover new physics relevant to a broad range of physiological processes involving excitable cells."

In more complex animals, such as vertebrates, hormones and the receptors to which they bind are critical signaling molecules involved in regulation of salt and water transport. Fish are in direct contact with water, and they must actively take up salts from freshwater and actively secrete them in seawater to be able to regulate internal salt concentrations. To date research on the hormonal control of salt regulation has been limited to studies on advanced fish species. This project will examine the hormonal control of salt regulation in two basal vertebrates, lamprey eel and sturgeon. The researchers will examine how growth hormone and prolactin, two hormones secreted by the pituitary gland, and their receptors are altered by external salinity. This research will determine the effect of these hormones on the ability of lamprey and sturgeon to tolerate changes in external salinity. The results of these studies will yield insights about the functional evolution of these hormones, which in turn could be applied to enhancing agricultural production of fish and management of invasive lamprey. The results will be rapidly transferred to textbooks in comparative endocrinology and physiology, published in peer-reviewed journals, and shared at scientific meetings. <br/><br/>Studies supported by this award will investigate the functional evolution of osmoregulatory hormones in aquatic vertebrates. Our current understanding of the hormonal control of osmoregulation in aquatic vertebrates comes almost entirely from advanced bony fish (teleosts), and there is no information on how pituitary hormones control osmoregulation in basal vertebrates. It is now well-established that prolactin (PRL) is critical for survival of most teleosts in freshwater (FW) and that growth hormone (GH), at least in some lineages, promotes osmoregulation in seawater (SW). Lamprey, as basal vertebrates, and chondrosteans (including sturgeon), as basal bony fish, have the same osmoregulatory strategy as teleosts (namely, maintaining nearly constant levels of plasma ions irrespective of external salinity), yet there is currently no information on whether PRL or GH play a role in osmoregulation of either lamprey or chondrosteans. There is strong evidence that lamprey possess only one member of the PRL/GH family of pituitary hormones (GH), making them especially critical for these studies. Our specific aims are: 1) to determine the response of GH and GH receptor to salinity change in lamprey; 2) to determine the osmoregulatory actions of GH in lamprey; and 3) to determine the osmoregulatory roles of GH and PRL in sturgeon. For each species we will examine the time course of physiological and endocrine responses to reciprocal transfers between FW and SW. We will utilize recombinant technology to make lamprey GH in order to develop homologous radioimmuno- and radioreceptor- assays, and determine its osmoregulatory actions in vivo and in vitro."

The increased frequency, duration and intensity of hypoxia events worldwide have led to impaired health and functioning of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Although the potential impacts of hypoxic exposure are severe, there is little known about the consequences of systemic, sub-lethal exposure to hypoxic events for populations and communities of fishes. The objective of this project is to determine whether sub-lethal exposure to hypoxia during early life stages leads to poor growth and hence increased mortality. This project will use ""environmental fingerprint"" methods in fish ear stones (otoliths) retrospectively to identify periods of hypoxia exposure. The project will compare consequences of hypoxia exposure in different fish species from the Gulf of Mexico, the Baltic Sea, and Lake Erie, thus examining the largest anthropogenic hypoxic regions in the world spanning freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. In addition, the research will increase awareness of hypoxia-related issues by disseminating curriculum materials to high schools in southern Texas that are dominated by Hispanic and Latino American students. As a part of this program, two high school teachers will be sponsored to participate in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ""Teacher At Sea"" program, where they will gain first-hand experience in biological sampling in the northern Gulf of Mexico ""Dead Zone"" and help lead teacher training workshops for additional high school teachers to implement hypoxia-related curriculum in their classrooms. In addition, this project will contribute significantly to basic information for critical stakeholder groups in Baltic Sea and Great Lakes fisheries via the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission. Two graduate students and one post-doc will also be supported in part by this project.<br/><br/>This project will employ long-term, permanent markers incorporated into fish otoliths to identify life-long patterns of sub-lethal hypoxia exposure far beyond time spans currently achievable using molecular markers. This work will capitalize on patterns of geochemical proxies such as Mn/Ca and I/Ca incorporated into otoliths and analyzed using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to identify patterns of sub-lethal hypoxia exposure. The investigators will then determine whether exposure results in differential growth and survival patterns compared to non-exposed fish by tracking cohorts over time and identifying characteristics of survivors. Because this work involves multiple species in multiple hypoxic regions, it will allow cross-system comparisons among unique ecosystems. The results from this project will thus provide unprecedented insight into effects of hypoxia exposure in three major basins using novel biogeochemical proxies, thereby paving the way for a fuller understanding of the impacts of ""dead zones"" on coastal resources."

Ionospheric scintillation refers to random fluctuations in amplitude and phase of radio signals traversing a region of turbulence in the ionosphere. It impacts the power and phase of the radio signal and is caused by small-scale (kilometer to centimeters) structure in the ionospheric electron density along the signal path. Ionospheric scintillation affects trans-ionospheric radio signals up to a few GHz in frequency and, thus, can have detrimental impacts on satellite-based communication and navigation systems, such as GPS-based systems, and also on scientific instruments requiring observations of trans-ionospheric radio signals, e.g. for radio astronomy. The physics behind the generation of the plasma irregularity structures that cause scintillation is not fully understood, largely due to a lack of adequate observations. An obvious consequence of this is that neither does a reliable capability exist for the prediction or mitigation of the effects of scintillations on radio waves. ISX will generate an extensive dataset for applying diffraction radio imaging, which enables the prediction of scintillations at any frequency determined from the imaged structure, and potentially the mitigation of distorted signals by canceling phase fluctuations. Another broader impact of the proposed project is that it is a pilot effort to provide global, space-based monitoring of ionospheric radio wave distortion using signals of opportunity available worldwide. While a single spacecraft cannot provide real-time monitoring, it can show the way for a constellation of spacecraft to provide such a space weather service in the future. Scintillation effects occur predominantly in the equatorial region in ionospheric density structures termed Equatorial Spread F (ESF). The main goal of this project is to provide new observations on the structure of scintillation-scale ionospheric irregularities associated with ESF. Specifically, ISX will simultaneously record scintillation patterns of multiple ground-based digital television (DTV) carrier signals. Scintillation patterns for a unique set of experimental geometries will be compared to determine how far along the magnetic field the turbulence maps, which is crucial observational data on the three-dimensional electrodynamics of these sub-km structures.<br/><br/>During the lifecycle of the project, it will provide extensive student training opportunities, including student involvement through Cal Poly spacecraft design classes and funded graduate students. Each year, 20-40 students will be involved in the design, fabrication, and flight of this mission. Cal Poly has flown many student satellite missions; the proposed effort will leverage the heritage and experience from all of these.<br/><br/>This project addresses the science question: To what distance along a flux tube does an irregularity of certain transverse-scale extend? It has been difficult to measure the magnetic field-alignment of scintillation-scale turbulent structures because of the difficulty of sampling a flux tube at multiple locations within a short time. This measurement is now possible due to the worldwide transition to DTV, which presents unique signals of opportunity for remote sensing of ionospheric irregularities from numerous vantage points. DTV spectra, in various formats, contain phase-stable, narrowband pilot carrier components that are transmitted simultaneously. A 4-channel radar receiver will simultaneously record up to 4 spatially separated transmissions from the ground. For most experimental geometries, the corresponding transmitter-satellite lines-of-sight will cross the same magnetic flux tube within 1-10 s, a reasonably short time to assume ""frozen"" irregularities. Correlations of amplitude and phase scintillation patterns corresponding to multiple points on the same flux tube will be a measure of the spatial extent of the structures along the magnetic field. A subset of geometries where two or more transmitters are aligned with the orbital path will be used to infer the temporal development of the structures. The radio receiver is based on the instrument developed and successfully demonstrated on the previous Radio Aurora eXplorer (RAX) NSF CubeSat project."

These phenomena often involve the physics of radiation transport. For example, neutrino radiation hydrodynamics is a key element of the physics governing environments with hot and dense nuclear matter. Such extreme environments include the Early Universe, during primordial nucleosynthesis of light nuclei such as hydrogen through lithium just after the Big Bang; the merger through inspiraling of neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries; and the death throes of massive stars, more than ten times the mass of the Sun, in stellar explosions known as core-collapse supernovae, which are responsible for elements such as oxygen and calcium without which life as we know it would not exist. Radiation transport and kinetic theory of particles besides neutrinos---photons, electrons, or neutrons---are also relevant to many areas of astrophysics, as well as a broad range of other science applications, including materials science, plasma physics, neutron transport, multiphase flows, and high-energy-density physics. As such, the availability of a software element to solve radiation transport problems is highly valuable to researchers.<br/><br/>This project will create and deploy a software element to solve radiation hydrodynamics problems on modern supercomputers featuring ""hybrid"" architectures that include traditional CPUs plus ""accelerators"" or ""coprocessors,"" such as GPUs or Intel Many Integrated Core processors, respectively.

In particular, the radiation transport solver will utilize the extant capabilities of GenASiS for adaptive computational ""mesh refinement,"" whereby the representation of the natural continuum is captured adaptively on a mesh of points foundational to any computational model in order to maximize the fidelity of the computational model for a given computational cost. We will use the so-called M1 approach, solving directly for the zeroth and first angular moments (energy density and momentum) of the radiation field, with higher-order moments given by ""closure relations,"" expressing them in terms of the zeroth and first moments. The energy dependence of the radiation field will be retained, with the zeroth and first angular moments discretized into ""energy bins."" Our computational approach to neutrino radiation transport will be an ""implicit-explicit"" (IMEX) scheme. Interactions between radiation and matter will be handled with a time-implicit subsolver, which will involve the inversion of dense matrices local to each node of the machine to exploit all available hardware in the node, including accelerators and coprocessors when available. Algorithms and software resulting from this project will be made available to the community. GenASiS, as an extensible, object-oriented simulation framework, will be valuable to researchers seeking to experiment with and implement different kinds of solvers for multi-physics problems.

But does this interaction make a significant difference to the Jovian magnetospheric dynamics as it does at Earth? Most believe that the effects of any interaction with the solar wind are completely overwhelmed by the effects of the rapid rotation of Jupiter's strong magnetic field and the extended torus of heavy ions created by Io's volcanoes. This question continues to be an area of active research and debate due in part to the lack of available solar wind measurements near Jupiter's orbit. The study will use a model that propagates solar wind conditions measured near Earth out to Jupiter in order to estimate solar wind conditions there. The work will examine observations of magnetic fields and particles within Jupiter's magnetosphere by the Galileo spacecraft, and images of Jupiter's aurora taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, to determine whether changes in these data may be statistically associated with changes in the modeled solar wind conditions. The results of this work will add to our knowledge of how planetary magnetospheres work, putting our understanding of the Earth's magnetosphere into a broader context, and informing the study of star-exoplanet interactions.

Results from the research and other recent advances in space plasma physics will be presented to the public during the Boston University Astronomy Department's weekly public open night at the campus observatory while groups are waiting to use the telescopes. Additionally, the proposer will mentor graduate students at Boston University through the Graduate Women in Science and Engineering program. <br/><br/>Previous attempts have been made to model solar wind conditions at Jupiter based on solar wind conditions near Earth but the success of this technique has so far been limited by the large uncertainties in the arrival times of solar wind disturbances. These uncertainties in turn make linking dynamical responses of Jupiter's magnetosphere to particular solar wind disturbances problematic. The innovation in this proposal is to use the observed compression of Jupiter's magnetic field in response to the dynamic pressure changes in the solar wind to refine the arrival time of disturbances in the solar wind and minimize uncertainties in timing. The statistical correlation (or lack thereof) between the arrival of solar wind disturbances and changes in Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurora will test the importance of solar wind interactions. Of particular importance, it will address whether quasi-periodic behavior observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere might be controlled by the solar wind. This study will also determine how Jupiter's main auroral emissions respond to changing solar wind conditions, and compare findings to theories and models."

Some of these clouds are harmless while others can penetrate into and disrupt the space environment around Earth in space weather events called geomagnetic storms. Understanding the solar disturbances that produce storms is important because severe space weather can damage satellites orbiting around Earth, endanger astronauts, and even disrupt power grids on the Earth?s surface. Accurate forecasting of strong magnetic storms is hindered by the fact that the features of a coronal mass ejection observed near the Sun do not remain constant but continually evolve as it moves through the background heliosphere on its way to Earth even interacting with other solar disturbances and with large scale magnetic fields and plasma structures in interplanetary space. Major storms have occurred due to changes in the structure of the coronal mass ejection during its propagation to Earth. In an effort to understand and eventually better predict the impacts of coronal mass ejections on the Earth?s space environment, this project takes a detailed look at the changes in the characteristics of coronal mass ejections as they move through the heliosphere, and at the physical mechanisms responsible for those changes, by combining remote-sensing and in-situ observations and comparing to large scale simulations. As an outcome of the project, a large database of events and associated observations will be made available online for the broader scientific community. Results will be disseminated in scientific publications, and through presentations at workshops and conferences. The project supports the training of a post doctoral researcher who will be based at the University of New Hampshire but will spend time working with co-investigators at both NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Naval Research Laboratory. Support of this postdoctoral researcher also serves to broaden the participation of an underrepresented group in a STEM field.

These satellites include Wind, ACE, Messenger, STEREO, SOHO, and SDO. Remote-sensing instruments view the coronal mass ejection as it lifts off the Sun while in-situ instruments measure its internal structure as it sweeps by on its way outward through the heliosphere. The characteristics of coronal mass ejections are inferred from each type of measurement using previously tested models. A key requirement is a consistent and robust methodology for combining these two very different types of data, which will be applied to some 100 events. As part of the development of the methodology, the discrepancies in the inferred characteristics of the coronal mass ejection from the various data sources will be reconciled. When combined with large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulations a study of the underlying physical mechanisms will be made albeit restricted to a limited number of these cases. Issues to be investigated include: the identification of unclear solar sources, undefined expansion rates, evidence of longitudinal/latitudinal deflections in the propagation, evidence for modifications of the coronal mass ejection due to collisions with solar wind structures or other transient events, and identification of magnetic flux-rope rotations."

By presenting the results of these design projects to local high school science classes, students will build confidence in their ability to succeed in STEM, while simultaneously inspiring the next generation of students to consider STEM careers.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Texas at Austin is to develop biomaterials for drug delivery system to transport large macromolecular cargos such as genes and proteins efficiently and specifically across the cell's plasma membrane. In this project, the investigator will be mimicking a strategy used by cells to recognize one another -coupling of ligand-receptor binding to membrane biomaterials that phase separate when they recognize threshold levels of receptors on the surfaces of target cells. This award is cofunded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This project will be addressing some of the challenges facing the drug delivery system of large macromolecular cargos efficiently and specifically to inside of the cell. This project will design and synthesize membrane-based biomaterials using synthetic and phase separating liposomes. Synthetic polysomes will be designed with careful tuning the density of ternary lipid mixture ligands and fusion proteins on its surface. During cell-cell recognition and fusion, ligand-receptor interactions alter the local membrane composition, causing cellular membranes to undergo a highly localized phase separation that dramatically concentrates ligands and receptors, strengthening cell-cell contacts. Following these contacts, these membrane biomaterials phase separate when they recognize threshold levels of receptors on the surfaces of target cells, driving membrane fusion and delivery of molecular cargos to the cellular cytoplasm. Furthermore, these materials provide new tools for designing 'cell-like' systems that sense and respond to environmental changes. Drawing on this toolkit, educational efforts will center on a new course that will challenge freshman in non-STEM majors to come up with ideas for 'simple biological machines'. This unique project will invite a diverse group of students to share in the excitement of scientific innovation while many are still choosing their academic major and future career, broadening participation in science on our campus."

Furthermore, the project will provide the community with a new, powerful tool to predict the evolution of ion charge states in the solar wind, as well as a powerful methodology to study the solar wind matching two completely different types of observations: high-resolution spectral and in-situ ion composition measurements. The project is primarily intended to fund and develop the skills of a graduate student, and the methodology and results coming from the research investigations will be incorporated into the graduate students thesis. The peculiar nature of the project, which connects two entirely different types of observations and of data analysis techniques, will uniquely position the graduate student at the crossroads of two communities the in-situ and remote sensing communities and will provide her/him the expertise to contribute to both of them.

The team will determine the temperature, density and wind velocity profiles that simultaneously fit both types in-situ and remote observations. During this project, the team will: (1) identify charge state ratios to be used for wind source region diagnostics; (2) develop an empirical model of solar wind plasma, which includes electron density, electron temperature, velocity, and element and ion composition as a function of distance; and, (3) determine the source regions of both fast and slow solar wind."

Substorms are frequent and studies of substorms allow researchers to investigate the basic physics of the dynamics of the solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere system. <br/> It is well recognized that magnetic reconnection occurs at the dayside magnetopause in the overwhelming majority of substorms and is generally thought to be the main way in which mass, momentum and energy are transported from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. However, other processes can also influence substorm dynamics. This is a proposal to evaluate the importance of the solar wind velocity and ionospheric conductivity on substorm dynamics. It is possible to separate these effects from the effects of reconnection because of the large 30 year data base created by the SuperMAG project. In a substorm the magnetosphere is first preconditioned by the solar wind. This preconditioning has two time scales. In this proposal it is hypothesized that those time scales are influenced by the solar wind velocity. One influence affects the reconnection rate at the dayside magnetopause and the other provides ?seed energy? to the plasma sheet. The investigators also propose to investigate the influence of ionospheric conductivity on substorm preconditioning by studying the effects of solar UV insolation. In particular they will investigate the semi-annual variation of geomagnetic activity with peak activity at the equinoxes and the observation that during substorms stronger auroras occur in the winter hemisphere. They propose to resolve the question of whether dipole tilt (and hence reconnection) drives the equinoctial variation or whether UV insolation is also important. <br/>This work will support a young woman scientist just starting her career. The Applied Physics Laboratory has an ongoing program to support summer interns. The database from this study will be very valuable to the overall magnetospheric physics effort."

However under extreme solar wind conditions such as those occurring during magnetic storms the CPCP becomes non-linear and saturates. This study will primarily support a post-doctoral scholar at Virginia Polytechnic and State University who will be taught about the operation of both coherent and incoherent scatter ionospheric radars.<br/><br/>The goals of this study are to investigate the causes of the saturation and to understand why the northern and southern hemispheres behave differently. There have been two classes of explanations for CPCP saturation. In one dayside region 1 field aligned currents limit the magnetic reconnection rate for strong driving and in the other an Alfvn wing is set up in which a portion of the electric field set up by the solar wind is reflected at the ionosphere as the result of a conductance mismatch between the Alfvnic conductance of the solar wind and the Pedersen conductance of the ionosphere. The team proposes a third explanation that ionospheric plasma instabilities lead to limitations on ionospheric currents and that this feeds back into the magnetosphere. The research involves using a hybrid simulation code and observations from SuperDARN and ISR radar in the ionosphere, ACE solar wind observations and THEMIS data in the magnetosphere."

Some of these clouds are harmless while others can penetrate into and disrupt the space environment around Earth in space weather events called geomagnetic storms. Understanding the solar disturbances that produce storms is important because severe space weather can damage satellites orbiting around Earth, endanger astronauts, and even disrupt power grids on the Earth?s surface. Accurate forecasting of strong magnetic storms is hindered by the fact that the features of a coronal mass ejection observed near the Sun do not remain constant but continually evolve as it moves through the background heliosphere on its way to Earth even interacting with other solar disturbances and with large scale magnetic fields and plasma structures in interplanetary space. Major storms have occurred due to changes in the structure of the coronal mass ejection during its propagation to Earth. In an effort to understand and eventually better predict the impacts of coronal mass ejections on the Earth?s space environment, this project takes a detailed look at the changes in the characteristics of coronal mass ejections as they move through the heliosphere, and at the physical mechanisms responsible for those changes, by combining remote-sensing and in-situ observations and comparing to large scale simulations. As an outcome of the project, a large database of events and associated observations will be made available online for the broader scientific community. Results will be disseminated in scientific publications, and through presentations at workshops and conferences. The project supports the training of a post doctoral researcher who will be based at the University of New Hampshire but will spend time working with co-investigators at both NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Naval Research Laboratory. Support of this postdoctoral researcher also serves to broaden the participation of an underrepresented group in a STEM field. In addition, the project will contribute to the training of an undergraduate student each year during the summer months through involvement in high-impact research at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of a suite of satellites currently observing the inner heliosphere with remote-sensing and in-situ instruments to answer fundamental questions about transient solar disturbances (in particular, coronal mass ejections) and how they change during propagation. These satellites include Wind, ACE, Messenger, STEREO, SOHO, and SDO. Remote-sensing instruments view the coronal mass ejection as it lifts off the Sun while in-situ instruments measure its internal structure as it sweeps by on its way outward through the heliosphere. The characteristics of coronal mass ejections are inferred from each type of measurement using previously tested models. A key requirement is a consistent and robust methodology for combining these two very different types of data, which will be applied to some 100 events. As part of the development of the methodology, the discrepancies in the inferred characteristics of the coronal mass ejection from the various data sources will be reconciled. When combined with large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulations a study of the underlying physical mechanisms will be made albeit restricted to a limited number of these cases. Issues to be investigated include: the identification of unclear solar sources, undefined expansion rates, evidence of longitudinal/latitudinal deflections in the propagation, evidence for modifications of the coronal mass ejection due to collisions with solar wind structures or other transient events, and identification of magnetic flux-rope rotations."

At the forefront of modern technology, matter structured at the nanometer and atomic levels increasingly reveals its wavelike nature. In recent years, cutting-edge experiments with ultracold atoms, pushing the limits of fundamental physics, have created new states of matter and offered the possibility of controlling quantum entanglement, with major potential applications in cryptography and in quantum computing. The electronic waves confined in quantum wells have yielded high-efficiency, light-emitting diodes that are about to revolutionize the energetics of lighting. At these scales, even the slightest disorder or irregularity can trigger one of the most puzzling and poorly understood phenomena, wave localization. Its dramatic impact has been observed and confirmed by experiments. At the same time, it has been acknowledged that at the present time the design of the most promising light sources (and, more generally, the investigation and exploitation of wave localization) rests on ill-defined concepts, for we still lack the tools necessary to relate disorder to the wave properties in an accurate manner. The present project offers a new approach to wave localization. Its main objective is to combine state-of-the-art techniques and results from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory with achievements of atomic physics so as to enable one to predict (and then manipulate) localization properties of mechanical, electromagnetic, and matter waves in precise and quantifiable mathematical terms. The project addresses mathematical problems involving the eigenfunctions and behavior of solutions to irregular partial differential equations seamlessly integrated with the latest research in systems of cold atoms, and ultimately aims to give to scientists and engineers a unique opportunity to produce desired wave localization properties on demand, at predetermined frequencies and at specific locations, and at the submillimeter or even atomic scales.<br/><br/>What is wave localization? It is an astonishing ability of physical systems to maintain vibrations in small portions of their original domains of activity, preventing extended propagation. One should not, in this context, think solely in terms of mechanical vibrations. Light is a particular example of an electromagnetic wave, wifi is delivered by waves, sound is a pressure wave, and, from the vantage point of quantum physics, even matter can be perceived as a type of wave. Whether wanted or unwanted, known or ignored, exploited or only sustained, localization of such waves plays a paramount role in our everyday life and will play an even greater one in the science and technology of the future. However, the intricate nature of this phenomenon and the perplexing rules of confinement that govern it remain largely a mystery. The goal of the present project is to establish the right mathematical tools with which to describe and manipulate it, to design and control localization behavior, in contrast to the current situation where researchers have to resort to limited experiments and costly trial-and-error runs. The project's aim is to unveil the fundamental laws of localization and eventually open the way to master vibrations (i.e., redirect, amplify, dampen, focus, and drive them) in all of their manifestations. The results of the research will bring novel methods to bear in analysis, probability, applied mathematics, condensed matter physics, mechanical engineering, acoustics, optics, and quantum physics, to name just a few areas of potential application. In addition, the project will become a platform for a unique interdisciplinary program of training for postdocs and students, with a line-up of activities specifically targeted to involve women and other STEM minorities in scientific research."

The geomagnetic field has its North Pole located at ~1,200-km of the North Geographic Pole towards Canada, but its South Pole is located about 1,550-km from the South Geographic Pole in Antarctica towards Pacific Ocean. This asymmetry is caused by the non-dipolar nature of the Earth's magnetic field that leads to various hemispherical differences in the interaction of the solar wind plasma flow with the Earth's magnetosphere. Thus the solar wind's energy and momentum are deposited into the polar ionospheres of both the Northern and Southern Polar Regions asymmetrically, causing considerable diversity in different electrodynamic parameters of the polar ionosphere reported in past studies. As new instrumentation techniques are developed, it is important to invest in development of new data assimilation and inverse methods to assure a more complete extraction of geophysical information out of new observations.<br/><br/>The magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is not symmetrical in terms of high-latitude ionospheric convection, field-aligned currents, electromagnetic energy (Poynting) flux, auroral particle precipitation, and upper atmosphere (thermosphere) responses. This study will quantify the degree of instantaneous interhemispheric imbalance of the electromagnetic energy deposition via geomagnetic field-aligned currents and ionospheric convection electric fields, integrating quantification of all these variables into a unified framework. Multiple types of space-based and ground-based observations can be simultaneously analyzed, creating a coherent interhemispheric picture of global ionospheric electrodynamics via the community Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) software technique. In the past, the lack of observations in the Southern polar region in comparison with the Northern polar region precluded a comprehensive analysis of interhemispheric ionosphere electrodynamic variables, unless exclusively relying on space-based observations. The recent availability of data from ground-based magnetometers and high frequency (HF) radars in the Southern polar region is changing this situation. <br/><br/>The proposed research is timely, using a creative, even transformative approach that takes advantage of new global interhemispheric observations available through the NSF-funded Active Magnetosphere and Polar Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), and SuperMAG database. This will help addressing fundamental questions of geospace research that have eluded conclusive explanation so far. Several electrodynamic variables will be self-consistently analyzed globally in both polar regions via the extensive assimilation of observational data. <br/><br/>This study will contribute significantly to the research and development activities at the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) where a new generation of AMIE mapping of interhemispheric high-latitude electrodynamics may become part of the services provided by SWPC to the U.S. Government agencies that address negative effects of space weather on the nationwide ground- and space-based technological systems. The updated AMIE will also become a common platform for active collaboration among national and international space scientists who study the global transfer of solar wind energy and momentum into the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere. At last, this interesting and important scientific research provides an ideal opportunity for educational experience and training for a graduate student through direct involvement in the study."

Some of the dissipated wave energy appears to heat the minor ions in the solar corona. Numerous numerical models have been developed to describe processes that could transfer energy to the ions via turbulence or wave-particle interactions. The predicted ion heating rate depends on both the specific energy transfer mechanism as well as the frequency distribution of wave power. Thus, the ion temperature data constrain theories of the ion heating and also provide insight into the wave spectrum. The project team will measure the ion temperatures in the quiet Sun corona and in plumes, building on the novel techniques developed during previous NSF-funded projects. The results of this project are expected to provide critical tests of the existing ion-heating theories. Accurate ion temperatures are also needed for the analysis of wave amplitudes. By determining the temperature and wave amplitudes self-consistently, the project team will obtain accurate measurements of both quantities. These are crucial for proving, or disproving, the existing wave-heating mechanisms of the solar corona."

The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The main objective of this SHINE project is to determine the relationships between the properties of locally accelerated ST ions observed in near-Earth's orbit and those of the concurrent in-situ interplanetary (IP) structures and provide observational constraints for the two main types of models. The project team will achieve this objective by answering the following three science questions: (1) what are the properties of potential IP sources of ST ions near 1 AU?; (2) what are the properties of locally accelerated ST ions associated with these IP structures?; and (3) what are the relationships between the properties of ST ions and those of the IP structures? In order to answer these questions, the project team will perform four tasks. The first task is to identify and eliminate the ST contributions from remote, discrete high-energy particle events. The second task is to identify and determine the properties of quiet-times and of IP structures such as compressions, rarefactions, CIRs, ICMEs, and IP shocks using ACE, Wind, and STEREO. The third task is to identify and determine the properties of ST ions associated with the above IP structures. The fourth task is to quantify the relationships and establish definitive links between properties of ST ions and IP structures and provide observational constraints for existing ST ion acceleration models."

It is a collaborative effort between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and University of Michigan. The objective is to develop a new generation of numerical simulation codes and tools for community-wide investigation of Solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CME), and solar energetic particles (SEP) to test theories of solar eruptions against observed events and work towards a predictive capability. The Modular Solar Eruptions Capability (MSEC) to be developed will consist of a set of interchangeable modules and libraries, including an observables and a training library, which will enable the user to model a complete solar eruption event, from energy build-up by flux emergence to space weather impact at Earth. The new capability builds on recent advances by the proposing team in understanding the physics of flares and CMEs and in modeling space weather. The team has developed some of the leading theories for solar activity and has delivered some of the most widely used space weather models that is currently available to the community. Specific defining objectives for the development of the MSEC include: utilizing a two-temperature model for the solar plasma and incorporating the necessary physics important for the energy state of the solar atmosphere; utilizing a new phenomenological model for the solar wind-based Alfvn-wave acceleration and dissipation; exploring the physical connection between the upper convection zone and the solar corona by coupling two state-of-the-art models of flux emergence with the global model of the solar corona, thereby addressing the issue of energy build-up and CME initiation in a self-consistent manner. The team forms a strong collaboration between internationally recognized experts in basic solar and heliospheric theory, in the modeling and data analysis of observed events, and in computational physics. <br/><br/>When completed, the MSEC will be delivered to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) for access by the scientific community and eventual transition to use for operational space weather forecasting. The state-of-the-art simulation codes and tools comprising the final MSEC constitute an innovative and potentially transformative capability that will be used by the whole community to attack the solar eruption problem. While the team will pursue an exciting science program that uses the new models to attack the core science problems in solar eruptions, it is envisioned that the bulk of the science results ultimately will be obtained by the outside community. The results of this effort will help advance our understanding and modeling of solar eruptions, which are high priority national space weather needs. Educational components of the project include the participation of postdocs and graduate students. The collaboration builds on and greatly strengthens a longstanding partnership between the partners. Amongst others, this will provide the opportunity for students of University of Michigan to work with leading NASA scientists and have access to the unique resources at GSFC, a national facility."

Optimal transport is the study of exactly how to do this so that the cost of transportation is the smallest it can be. This is a very broad field with many applications, from the planning of urban transportation networks to molecular transport. The present project considers several important generalizations of the classical optimal transport problem which have not been previously studied. For example, a natural question to consider is what happens if there are two or more entities transporting the same initial mass to another location, each having its own costs to minimize. This is the ""game theoretic"" version of the optimal transport problem. Another problem deals with time-dependent transportation costs. This considers various cases when moving objects is more or less expensive depending on the time of movement. Overtime payments or transport in congested periods fall into this category. Transport problems in which one seeks to minimize the worst possible costs (instead of some average cost) are also important in applications and are considered here. Since optimal transport arises in many economic, biological, engineering, and other scientific areas, the mathematical theory developed for the problems considered in this project could have a significant practical impact. In addition, the project will study several new mathematical models arising in image processing and in understanding the motion of frontal boundaries due to flame or plasma propagation.<br/><br/>The relaxed version of the optimal transport problem involves finding a measure, called a ""transport plan,"" that minimizes the integral of a given cost density, subject to the constraint that the transport plan has given marginals. This is a one-player transport problem. Several generalizations of this much studied problem will be considered in this project. For example, if there are two players, each with their own cost density and each choosing their own transport plan, then they are coupled through the cost densities and, more importantly, through the given marginals. Another generalization of the original problem is to consider cost densities that depend on time. When that happens, the transport plan and map will also depend on time. Yet another line of investigation is driven by issues in the emerging area of L-infinity optimal transport, where the cost to be minimized is represented as the essential supremum of a cost function rather than the integral of a cost density. Optimal transport differential equations for the transport maps in the game model should lead to generalized Monge-Ampere systems. Dynamic programming of the time-dependent and perhaps the game-theoretic transport problem should lead to Hamilton-Jacobi equations in measure spaces. Existence of a generalized Nash equilibrium in the non-zero-sum case will be established. Finally, several PDE models arising in the study of quasiconvex functions and in the theory of stochastic differential games will be analyzed. The techniques used to tackle the problems proposed in this project will involve nonlinear functional analysis, game theory, and nonlinear partial differential equations arising from dynamic programming, as well as the theory of viscosity solutions for first and second order partial differential equations and modern methods in the calculus of variations."

In particular, stability of uni-directional and multiply periodic traveling waves with respect to uni-lateral as well as higher-dimensional transverse perturbations will be considered. Furthermore, stability of such traveling structures to non-localized perturbations inducing global phase shifts will be investigated.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the project is a study of stability and behavior of traveling waves in many equations arising, for example, as models of water waves and thin films, and in plasma physics and engineering. Such solutions travel at constant speed without changing shape, and often form fundamental building blocks for more complicated solutions of the model equations. Studying their stability to small perturbations (i.e. whether the wave is quickly restored to the orginal wave form) is of practical importance, since waves that are unstable do not naturally manifest themselves in physical situations, except possibly as transient phenomena. This proposal aims to provide researchers with practical and efficient ""rules of thumb"" to ascertain stability of mathematical solutions arising in physical models. A central component of the proposal is the educational and professional training of undergraduate and graduate students, who will receive interdisciplinary instruction through seminars, conferences, and special topics courses."

It underlies a diverse array of tools widely used in science and engineering, and it offers the promise of further applications in the future. The proposed research deals with foundational issues that may help to underpin future applications. In PDE, the project will study the long-time dynamical properties of several fundamental equations describing diverse physical phenomenon. In particular, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) models the transmission of data in fiber optic communication systems, and the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) models surface water waves as well as ion-acoustic waves in a cold plasma. The so-called fractional NLS is used as a model describing charge transport in bio polymers like DNA. Proposed problems on near-linear behavior and smoothing are directly motivated by real world engineering problems in fiber optic communication systems, and the methods used are likely to be useful in a range of applications.<br/><br/>In harmonic analysis this project focuses on problems in Euclidean spaces centered around Lebesgue norm inequalities. One subject of on-going research is the Fourier restriction phenomenon and its applications to problems in PDE and geometric measure theory. In the PDE component of the project, the focus is on the dynamical properties of linear and nonlinear dispersive equations. Subjects of interest here are dispersive decay and smoothing estimates for Schrodinger and wave equations, and their applications to the stability problem for their nonlinear counterparts. Another topic is the regularity properties of the solutions of nonlinear dispersive PDE such as the KdV equation, the Zakharov system, and the fractional NLS. The principal investigator will continue to explore the smoothing effect of the dispersive linear group on bounded domains, and he will study applications to the regularity properties and long-time dynamics of the nonlinear solutions. Proposed applications are on the existence and regularity of global attractors, dispersive quantization/Talbot effect, bounds for higher order Sobolev norms, and controllability."

Shock waves are ubiquitous in nature, from quantum levels to cosmological scales. They occur in a great variety of physically important phenomena, such as the air flow around an airliner's wing, flows of dense granular materials, fluids undergoing liquid-solid or vapor-liquid phase transitions, magneto-hydrodynamics, nonlinear elasticity, and many other important situations. The mathematical theory describing realistic multi-dimensional dynamics for these phenomena is under-developed. This project will focus on several important problems whose solution holds the promise of elucidating general phenomena. In particular, the project will consider the glancing shock reflection problem (that originated from the problem initially proposed by John von Neumann), formation of shocks in supersonic regimes, and others. The project will bring high-performance computing to bear on the understanding of these problems; the numerical solutions obtained have the potential to lead to advances in the theory.<br/><br/>This project addresses the mathematical modeling and analysis of a number of multi-dimensional Riemann problems whose solutions contain classical or nonclassical shocks. A common theme of much of the work in this project is the formulation of problems using asymptotic model equations that retain the essential physics present in the underlying governing equations. These asymptotic models can then be solved numerically, enabling vastly greater numerical resolution to be achieved in regions where the solutions exhibit small-scale features. The project addresses fundamental questions in compressible fluid flow and nonlinear hyperbolic systems, including those systems that admit small-scale dependent shocks (examples include models for magneto-hydrodynamics, phase transitions, complex fluids, etc.). The mathematical theory of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, and more generally of hyperbolic conservation laws, is largely incomplete in more than one space dimension, and the project will attack a number of multidimensional problems that are likely to be amenable to solution. Numerical solutions of these problems have the potential to lead to the development of the theory and resolve various paradoxes in the existing theories."

This research will significantly reduce the principal bottleneck for developing future energy technologies, i.e., the lack of reliable damage-resistant materials for use under extreme environments. The research will critically advance knowledge about the interaction of particle and plasma beams with various materials under extreme irradiation conditions. These scientific outcomes have related policy impacts for systems modeling and energy planning in both the near and long term for both developed and developing countries as global appetites for energy continue to increase. Improving sustainability outcomes while securing our energy future entails a global outlook that brings together the appropriate people and resources to not only advance basic research but also to ensure the existence of a diverse, globally-minded and well-trained cadre of scientists, policy specialists, and industry workers. The goal for this project is to provide robust computer resources and experimental validation to minimize irradiation-based design constraints of materials performance while situating this research within a larger context of sustainability, resource management, and global energy policy. This project draws on international research partnerships to develop the human capital essential for further work in materials under extreme conditions. It brings together key partners and research facilities in Japan, Russia, Germany, and Ireland that will enable graduate student research across disciplines with a focus on Nuclear Energy/Fusion, Lithography, and High Energy and Nuclear Physics Applications. No one location can provide all these facilities; together with resources at Purdue, Illinois, and Tuskegee, students gain critical experience in modeling, simulation, and experimentation. Scientific gains from the experimental research also have potentially far-reaching implications for industrial sectors such as semi-conductor manufacturing using EUVL as well as in energy sectors including solar, wind, and coal. The education model focuses on engaging students in both course-related and research opportunities and on providing multiple types of international experiences that develop global competencies.

Finally, both the analysis and simulation of the equations will determine the regime of validity of these equations as models for the physical applications. A supplemental benefit of this research is that the numerical algorithms it develops will be applicable to a broad class of equations and physical problems. <br/><br/>The equations under investigation in this project are of the nonlinear Schrdinger type, including the derivative nonlinear Schrdinger equation and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Major analytical questions this work will address include the existence and stability of singular solutions and nonlinear bound states. These problems will be addressed through asymptotic analysis, variational methods, and spectral theory. Singularity formation will also be investigated through simulation, using adaptive meshing methodology, such as iterative grid redistribution. Numerical algorithms for simulating the time dependent problems will be implemented by operator splitting methods, treating the nonlinear and linear dispersive parts of the equation separately. This numerical analysis will be pursued with the intention of constructing efficient energy preserving methods suitable for long time simulation. An algorithm for computing nonlinear bound states will be studied in a semi-discrete form, so as to be insensitive to spatial discretization. The bound state algorithms will assist in the construction of initial conditions, which can then be studied using the time dependent algorithms."

Understanding how and why Earth's climate changed before human observations can be overcome through the measurement and interpretation of the chemical composition of marine sediments. Accurate interpretation of these records -- also known as ""proxy"" records, because they stand in for direct measurements of environmental conditions in the past -- first requires that the behavior of the proxy be properly calibrated against direct observations in modern environments. This project will develop a novel proxy for marine nutrient utilization based on a comprehensive characterization of the chemical composition of particulate organic matter in the Southern Ocean. The formation and export of organic matter in the ocean requires nutrients, consumes carbon, and can influence the global air-sea balance of carbon dioxide. New proxies and calibrations offer novel ways of looking at Earth's climate history and can potentially illuminate interactions within marine ecosystems.<br/><br/>The efficiency of the biological carbon pump depends critically on the availability and utilization of marine nutrients, particularly in the Southern Ocean. However, ambiguity in, and disagreement between current nutrient utilization paleoproxies renders reconstruction of past nutrient regimes uncertain. Cadmium -- a known proxy for phosphate -- offers a means to circumvent many of the known limitations of existing nutrient proxies, but requires a full isotopic characterization before its application. In this project, researchers will trace the stable isotopic composition of cadmium recorded in organic matter using multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The researchers will make isotopic measurements across numerous surface nutrient regimes in the Southern Ocean, with a focus on three critical geochemical transitions: the formation of organic carbon at the sea surface, its transit and decomposition through the ocean's interior, and its behavior during burial on the sea floor. This sea surface-to-sea floor calibration will thus comprehensively determine the utility and fidelity of a novel nutrient proxy, allowing a more accurate view of how Earth's climate was related to ocean biogeochemistry in the past."

This project will collect the larvae of the non-seasonal, brooding scleractinian Flabellum impensum to be used in a month-long climate change experiment at Palmer Station. Multidisciplinary techniques will be used to examine larval development and cellular stress using a combination of electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectometry. Data from this project will form the first systematic study of the larval stages of polar cold-water corals, and how these stages are affected by temperature stress at the cellular and developmental level. <br/><br/>Cold-water corals have been shown to be important ecosystem engineers, providing habitat for thousands of associated species, including many that are of commercial importance. Understanding how the larvae of these corals react to warming trends seen today in our oceans will allow researchers to predict future changes in important benthic communities around the globe. Associated education and outreach include: 1) Increasing student participation in polar research by involving postdoctoral and undergraduate students in the field and research program; ii) promotion of K-12 teaching and learning programs by providing information via a research website, Twitter, and in-school talks in the local area; iii) making the data collected available to the wider research community via peer reviewed published literature and iv) reaching a larger public audience through such venues as interviews in the popular media, You Tube and other popular media outlets, and local talks to the general public."

Floquet theory, dynamical systems methods, perturbation theory, numerical spectral diagnostics, and multi-symplectic and conformal integrators, will be used to address the questions of generation and persistence of rogue waves. Physical lab-tank experiments will test and validate the analysis of the correlation between proximity to instabilities and homoclinic data, and the likelihood of rogue waves; whether nonlinear damping eliminates rogue waves through downshifting.

These equations describe fluid motions for gases and liquids under quite general conditions, from laminar to turbulent flows, on scales ranging from below a millimeter to astronomical lengths. Consequently, their study has wide-ranging applications in aeronautical sciences, in meteorology, in the petroleum industry, in plasma physics, and more recently, in biophysical fluid dynamics. The inherent nonlinear and multi-scale nature of these equations make the problem of weather forecasting and understanding climate evolution challenging. The investigators develop analytical and computational tools to study the long-term behavior of the fundamental governing equations of the atmosphere and climate. A main focus is to connect recently developed techniques of data assimilation with the theory of statistical solutions of these equations. This in turn facilitates the incorporation of vast amounts of weather/climate data, collected over a long period of time, into mathematical models of weather and climate, potentially leading to improved statistical prediction. Graduate students are engaged in the work of the project. <br/><br/>The investigators study several aspects of turbulent flows, including the time of existence of smooth solutions, statistical properties, and the long-term dynamics on the strong or weak global attractor, in a new class of functional spaces that is contained in all Sobolev classes. A key feature of this class is that the nonlinear evolution equation satisfies a differential inequality that is almost linear. This functional class has the property that it can absorb derivatives, which has the effect of making the nonlinear term milder, with potential applications to a wide class of nonlinear evolution equations. For certain types of initial data, this yields a better existence time for the Navier-Stokes equations than some well-known Sobolev functional classes. This new class of functional spaces is employed to study the finite-dimensional properties of statistical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, via the determining modes, nodes, and determining forms. Furthermore, the investigators develop data assimilation techniques for statistical solutions of hydrodynamic equations. Statistical solutions are directly related to the average physical quantities with which engineers are concerned. They provide a bridge from the time average of physical observables such as energy, enstrophy, and heat transfer to ensemble measures on the phase space. The techniques developed in this project should have immediate engineering and scientific applications."

This research by two investigators at Virginia Tech, one of whom is early career, explores an exciting and potentially transformative new experimental method by which synthetic fluid inclusions, filled with fluids of seawater-like composition, are grown in the laboratory and then held at temperatures and pressures at which important geological mineral reactions occur. In these reactions, secondary minerals precipitate inside the inclusion due to the reaction between the fluid and host mineral. This research targets serpentinization of the ocean crust, which involves the formation of serpentine, a hydrous mineral, and other secondary phases from anhydrous magnesium-rich silicate minerals (olivine, pyroxene,and garnet) that are the primary constituents of seafloor lavas. Serpentinization of ocean crust releases H2O into the mantle which can trigger melting and arc volcanism. It is also linked to the generation of abiotic organic compounds due to the release of hydrogen during mineral reaction. These organic molecules can form the base of the food chain for microbes living in in the ocean crust. Broader impacts of the work include (1) developing new experimental methods and demonstrating their utility, (2) developing the Raman spectroscopic identification of hydrous minerals associated with serpentinization reactions, (3) support of an early career female scientist and a minority graduate student; and (4) creation of podcasts on science in Spanish to inform and excite Hispanic audiences about science and the proposed research. <br/><br/>This experimental program will react fluids in minerals at ~280 degrees C for a number of weeks and monitor the dissolution and precipitation reactions that take place in the fluid inclusions as a function of time, temperature, fluid composition, and host mineral composition using a variety of state-ot-the-art analytical techniques that include: microthermometry, Raman spectroscopy, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, micro-FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, and FIB-SEM (focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy). An additional research goal is to develop Raman spectroscopy as a tool for the identification of phases associated with serpentinization, including the identification of chrysotile, lizardite, antigorite, and magnetite, as well as the protolith phases undergoing reaction. Results of the experiments will be compared with predictions from thermodynamic models. Successful development of this experimental technique and demonstation of its applicabilty has the potential to impact other fields of science such as pharmachology and materials science where the ability to observe chemical reactions and their rates of reaction in host crystals in real-time may lead to breakthroughs in understanding."

Migratory birds are excellent model systems for investigating such integrative questions because migratory birds are impressive endurance athletes that use primarily fats to fuel their flights, and diet strongly influences fatty acid composition of stored fat that in turn affects whole-animal energetics during exercise. Reliance on fatty acid oxidation to fuel high-intensity endurance exercise in birds is remarkable in part because it increases oxidative stress which must be dealt with by the bird's antioxidant defense system. In fact, human health requires a ready supply of dietary antioxidants to combat the free radicals produced as part of normal metabolism, and much contemporary medical research is focused on understanding how dietary antioxidants promote human health. The primary goals of the two proposed research projects are to experimentally determine how certain essential fatty acids stimulate fat metabolism in exercising birds, how the antioxidant defense system of birds responds to the increased oxidative stress associated with exercise, and how this interaction between fat metabolism and antioxidant defenses depends on changes in seasonal demands during fall and spring migration. <br/><br/>The proposed research builds on the successful collaborative research and teaching programs at a primarily undergraduate (Sacred Heart University) and R1 research (University of Rhode Island) institution. The proposed research will allow URI graduate students to learn fatty acid analysis at SHU, and SHU undergraduates will help URI researchers with field work, captive bird studies, and laboratory analyses for measuring plasma metabolites as indicators of health in wild birds. The two PIs will continue their tradition of training undergraduate and graduate students by utilizing URI's enhancing diversity initiatives and SHU's collaborative with the inner-city Bridgeport (CT) public school system. The proposed research will also strengthen established collaborations with biologists in southern New England working for NGOs such as The Nature Conservancy, Audubon, and local land trusts as well as international collaborations (jointly supported by NSF International Science and Engineering (ISE) Section) with colleagues at the Advance Facility for Avian Research, University of Western Ontario, and Max Plank Institute for Ornithology, Germany. Currently, there is much public interest in dietary antioxidants and how they promote human health. Migratory birds offer an interesting model system for studying the role of dietary antioxidants and fats on fat metabolism during exercise because birds have relatively low rates of free radical production in spite of higher metabolic rates and much higher maximum longevity than mammals of similar body size. In addition, patterns of bird migration have been implicated in the dispersal of disease (e.g. avian flu) and migratory bird populations are declining due to the loss of suitable habitat for stopover sites during their migration. The PIs longstanding collaborative field studies in southern New England guarantees the results will continue to be used for land conservation and management efforts."

Corn takes up most of its water through a particular set of roots called the nodal roots. Under drought, the nodal roots must grow through dry soil to reach available water to sustain the plant. However, very little is known about the mechanisms that allow nodal roots to achieve this essential feat. This project will use a combination of physiological and genomics approaches to define the molecular mechanisms underlying how the nodal roots are able to maintain growth under drought. The information generated by the project will lead to the development of innovative approaches to enable corn and other cereal crops to access more water and increase yield under drought, and will thereby contribute to the essential goals of increased food security and stability. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research training internships for undergraduate students from Fort Valley State University, a Historically Black University (HBCU) located in Fort Valley (GA). The project will also disseminate research findings and provide information to the general public through various communication, technical training and outreach activities. These include but are not limited to science communication workshops involving journalism students and hands-on training workshops on metabolomics and the use of bioinformatics tools to analyze and integrate multi-omics datasets. <br/><br/>This project integrates root physiology and functional genomics [transcriptomics, plasma membrane proteomics, and metabolomics (including hormones)] to deliver a comprehensive understanding of nodal root growth responses to water deficit stress in both controlled laboratory studies and in the field. The project focuses on a maize inbred line that has been shown to exhibit superior ability for nodal root growth under water-limited conditions. A collaborative interdisciplinary team will address the following specific objectives: 1) elucidation of the physiological and molecular basis of nodal root growth responses to water stress using a novel divided-chamber model system for precise imposition of water deficit conditions around the growing roots; 2) characterization of nodal root growth and root growth zone transcriptomic responses in response to water stress in the field, using ""drought simulators"" for precise imposition of the timing, intensity and duration of drought; and 3) integration and analysis of all datasets using a suite of informatics tools to identify candidate genes that will be genetically validated in plants. This multidisciplinary strategy provides unique opportunities to greatly improve basic understanding of root biology under drought, and to broadly train the next generation of plant scientists. Data and biological materials generated by this project will be accessible to a project website (to be developed) and through deposition to long-term repositories such as the Maize Genetics Cooperative (for germplasm), and MaizeGDB, Gramene and the NCBI's GEO and SRA (for sequence and phenotypic datasets)."

After production in the leaves, the sugar needs to be moved to other parts of the plant where this energy is consumed. These consuming tissues are termed 'sinks'. Analogous to our circulatory systems, plants have a network of cells called the phloem that allow the movement of sugars from source (leaves) to the sink tissues. Scientists have long sought to increase the yield of crops by regulating the movement of sugars, the theory being that if supplies are increased, yield can be increased while the input of costly and environmentally problematic fertilizers is diminished. Previous work has identified a transporter within the phloem and this proposal aims to characterize the function of this key regulator in sugar transport. Specifying how this transporter moves sugar to various tissues within the plant will allow scientists to develop strategies to optimize sugar translocation in crops that increase yield while reducing the environmental impacts of production agriculture. The Hispanic roots of the lead scientist for this project give this team an edge in engaging Hispanic audiences by communicating complex scientific topics in Spanish to ignite interest in science among the general public and among students. The scientists involved in this project will organize an international meeting on agricultural biotechnology and society, and will also develop bilingual web-based teaching tools to promote scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The partitioning of photoassimilates between their sites of production and utilization is a key determinant of plant growth and development. Emerging evidence suggests regulation of photoassimilate partitioning is mediated in part by a type I H+-PPase. A role for this transporter has been established at the tonoplast; however, this exclusive function has been unsettled by recent work showing plasma membrane (PM) localization of this transporter and establishing that it is prominently expressed in phloem companion cells (CC). The researchers propose this enzyme has two opposing roles, PPi hydrolysis and synthesis that contribute to a cascade of events that energize plant growth. They will test the capacity of the Arabidopsis thaliana H+-PPase to synthetize PPi in a heterologous system (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in plants. Concurrently, a series of genetic, immunohistochemical and physiological experiments will determine how this pump affects the partitioning of assimilates. This fundamental research will catalog that H+-PPases as a central mediator involved in the allocation and metabolism of photosynthates."

The spatial and temporal characterization of atmospheric pollution at high elevations in the Third Pole region is needed because recent studies suggest that atmospheric ""brown clouds"" deposition to the Himalayan glaciers may affect their energy balance, resulting in an acceleration of ablation. Knowledge of the initial quality of the meltwater, resulting from the ongoing shrinking of the glaciers in the Himalaya, is also important for planning the availability of water resources for millions of people who live downstream from these glaciers. Ultimately all these studies serve as a source of fundamental information for policy makers trying to mitigate the impact of trace metals in the environment.

The proposed work will enable realization of high-performance vacuum electronic devices that can be integrated on semiconductor chips at the micrometer scale. These microscale high current density emitters would surpass the current state-of-art and could enable a large array of new applications that exploit vacuum electronics for display, high data-rate communications, high-temperature electronics, and imaging. The project will lead to training and education of graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary and novel area of semiconductor technology, and could lead to several new commercially relevant applications for vacuum electronic circuits and systems.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will combine the complementary expertise in Si fabrication and vacuum electronics at Purdue University, and III-nitride heterostructure and polarization engineering at Ohio State University to demonstrate reliable high current density emitters. A new approach to Si field emitters will be investigated to take advantage of current saturation effects in Silicon with fairly low carrier concentration, The Si emitters will be designed to control current density through lattice and ionized impurity scattering limited transport. A parallel approach using heterostructure and polarization engineering will be pursued to achieve highly efficient field emission in planar III-nitride semiconductor structures. III-nitride semiconductors have intrinsic polarization that enables large voltages to be dropped across nanometer scale distances. This enables field engineering to align the conduction band within the semiconductor with the vacuum level outside. The polarization engineering concepts will be combined with ballistic transport in ultrascaled structures to achieve efficient field emission from III-nitride semiconductor surfaces. The proposed device will enable high current density field emission in planar geometries that could be advantageous for several applications. Sophisticated modeling techniques including 2-dimensional electro-thermal simulations and Monte Carlo simulations of transport in heterostructures will be developed at Purdue University and Ohio State University to design and evaluate the vacuum emitters in both Silicon and III-nitride material systems. Development and demonstration of micro-fabrication technology for integrated vacuum electronic devices will be done. The proposed work would lead to better understanding of field emission from engineered nanoscale structures and III-nitride semiconductors. The concepts proposed here use promising and novel approaches for overcoming challenges related to high current density emitters, and could therefore have transformative impact on the science and applications of vacuum microelectronics."

The radar will be used in an extension of an existing MST-ISR mode. Besides transmitting long and coded pulses for interlaced detection of mesospheric echoes and ionospheric incoherent scatter radar returns (so-called MST and ISR signals), short and uncoded pulses will be transmitted to probe the turbulent equatorial electrojet height region (E-region proper) with high temporal and spatial resolution. Short-pulse data from the electrojet will be used to provide gravity wave signatures from the equatorial E region to complement the D-region and upper E-region (above 140 km) gravity wave data acquired in the MST-ISR mode. The overall objective will be to improve the current understanding of gravity wave propagation and guiding in the equatorial mesosphere and lower thermosphere and the role of gravity waves in the structuring of the region via neutral and plasma instability processes. Gravity waves are known to play a crucial role in the dynamic coupling of atmospheric regions. Waves that propagate upward through the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (or that may be generated as secondary waves) may grow to significant amplitudes in the E and F regions of the ionosphere. The fast continuous sampling by the Jicamarca radar provides important information on short period (5-15 minute) gravity wave oscillations and instabilities of the neutral atmosphere at low latitudes. Short period waves are always present in the equatorial mesosphere as evident in Jicamarca vertical wind data and also in the equatorial upper E-region as evident in enhanced backscatter from the 150-km altitude region observed at Jicamarca. The connection of these wave systems and their relation to gravity waves in the intervening E-region altitudes remain unknown and unexplored. Above Jicamarca, this region is occupied by a turbulent equatorial electrojet (EEJ) causing strong radar backscatter. The modulation of this backscatter signal is what will be exploited for a novel study of the gravity wave content of the region and its relationship to gravity waves observed in the mesosphere and the upper E-region."

The ionosphere, thermosphere, and magnetosphere comprise a tightly coupled system at high latitudes. The ionosphere is the mediating element in this view, facilitating the transfer of free energy generated by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling into heat and bulk motion of the neutral atmosphere. This mediation occurs through electric fields, particle precipitation, diffusion, and field-aligned currents, agents that act collectively to structure the plasma density and composition within the system. Although elements of this system have been studied in considerable detail, their nonlinear interactions, and the global implications of these regional processes, remains poorly understood and inadequately observed. The electronic steering capability of PFISR offers a unique diagnostic to fill this gap. Using a dense grid of beams, a three-dimensional, time dependent view of the ion-neutral interactions can be developed. These results, in coordination with observations by common volume optical, and VHF and HF radar observations, allow access to system dynamics and system responses which were previously unobservable. The experimental campaign, involving twenty researchers from nine institutions, will be carried out over two winter seasons. The results will be used to address fundamental questions of the physics of the upper atmosphere and its coupling to the magnetosphere and the lower atmosphere, which have remained obscured for lack of key data. As a result, although it is understood that small-scale processes play critically important roles in this coupling, they have been difficult to include in quantitative models. The new information will be implemented in the GITM model validating the new understanding of the coupled magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere, and thereby providing enhanced simulation capabilities."

The overarching objective to investigate the gravity wave-driven coupling between the terrestrial atmosphere and the lower thermosphere/ ionosphere. In-situ instrumentation will measure the perturbations the waves produce in both neutral and ion densities at F-region heights, while on-board photometers will simultaneously measure the wavelengths and amplitudes of the wave fields in the upper mesosphere. Subsequent modeling coupled with meteorological data will reveal the connections between tropospheric storms and the MLTI system using state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques that include the effects of wave dissipation. The ionospheric ion density and temperature will be measured in-situ via the retarding potential analysis (RPA) technique. The electronics for the RPA will be built at Virginia Tech, but will involve only minor modifications to the flight proven UT Dallas design. The in-situ upper atmospheric neutral gas density will be measured by two distinct sensors: a traditional Bayard-Alpert (BA) ion gauge provided by the Aerospace Corporation, and new, diamond-like carbon (DLC) microtip-based gauge design that is better adapted to the power constraints of a CubeSat mission. The University of Illinois will provide a suite of nadir-viewing photometers to measure perturbations in the O2 (0-0) Atmospheric (A) and O2 Herzberg I (HI) band airglow emissions in the 90-100 km region during the nighttime portion of the orbit.<br/><br/>This mission is the first of its kind; no previous satellite experiment has ever been devoted to identifying causal gravity wave links between the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, and no previous experiment has systematically mapped active gravity wave regions at low and middle latitudes through direct observation of their ionospheric effects. These waves are a vitally important but under-explored facet of atmospheric physics. They strongly influence the dynamics of the media through which they travel by modifying the structure of the atmosphere at altitudes well above their source regions, and they may seed the development of plasma instabilities that scintillate and disrupt radio propagation. The fundamental science goals of the experiment are to: 1) systematically observe gravity waves with large vertical wavelengths at lower F-region heights, and correlate on a global scale remotely-sensed wave-induced airglow perturbations in the upper mesosphere with in-situ measurements of ion and neutral density fluctuations at higher altitudes, and 2) produce global maps of active gravity wave regions in the mid- and low-latitude ionosphere over multiple seasons at all local times, so that global patterns and climatological variations can be quantitatively compared to and correlated with terrestrial weather systems via modeling. The challenging cubesat mission is a high-risk effort but one with immensely high potential pay-off in providing a unique observational dataset of fundamental thermosphere and ionosphere parameters and related cutting-edge scientific findings. <br/><br/>Active collaborations between engineering students at Virginia Tech and the University of Illinois will be established during the design, fabrication, integration, and environmental testing of the LAICE payloads and spacecraft; at least 60 undergraduates will participate in one or more phases of the development work, and in subsequent data analysis activities. Strong collaboration will occur between the schools in instrumentation systems, satellite communications, and data analysis. Facilities at both institutions will be used to test, integrate, and calibrate spaceflight hardware, and results will be presented at annual small-spacecraft conferences.

Although neuroendocrine and experiential influences on paternal behavior have been studied in numerous species, the proximate regulation of the onset of paternal care remains poorly understood. In female mammals, hormonal changes associated with the onset of motherhood (i.e., with pregnancy, parturition and lactation) activate maternal behavior in part by decreasing new mothers' anxiety-like or neophobic responses towards their newborns. It is unknown whether anxiety reduction plays a similar role in the onset of male parental care, but several physiological and behavioral measures of anxiety have been negatively correlated with aspects of paternal care. The aim of this research is to study the role of reduction in anxiety ""permitting"" the expression of paternal behavior by males. This research has great relevance to human and human behavior and inadequate paternal involvement and care is associated with many difficulties observed in family interactions and subsequent behavior of children as parents. To test this researcher will study the California mice, which displays many of the same social behavior and family structures as humans. <br/><br/>Ingestion of placenta by parturient female mammals is very common, and can elicit behavioral and physiological changes in mothers that enhance their care of offspring. In several biparental mammals, fathers also ingest placenta during the birth of their young; however, the function of placentophagia by males is unknown. Recent research conducted by the co-PI and PI has found that when sexually inexperienced male California mice (Peromyscus californicus) are administered placenta via oral gavage, they subsequently show reduced latencies to approach a novel object or an unrelated pup, as well as reduced neural activity (Fos-immunoreactivity) in the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a brain region associated with anxiety. Thus, these behavioral and neural results suggest that placenta ingestion may reduce anxiety in males. Several studies have found indirect evidence for an inverse relationship between anxiety and paternal care in this and other species. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that placentophagia by male California mice reduces their anxiety, and by doing so may increase their paternal responsiveness. First-time expectant fathers and virgin males will be treated via oral gavage with placenta in oil or oil alone, or left untreated, and subsequently tested for anxiety-like behavior and paternal behavior. Plasma will be assayed for allopregnanolone (an anxiolytic steroid produced in placenta), and neural activity (Fos-immunoreactivity) will be determined in brain areas known to regulate anxiety and paternal care, to determine if placentophagia may reduce anxiety in new fathers through anxiolytic effects of alloprenanolone. Results will provide novel insights into the functional significance of placentophagia by males as well as possible influences on the activation of male parental care."

However, its presence in the cell wall constitutes a formidable obstacle in chemical pulping to produce fine paper, for digesting the forage crops fed to ruminants, and for producing renewable biofuels from cellulosic biomass. The biosynthesis of monolignols, the precursors to lignin, occurs in the cytosol, i.e., the intracellular fluid present in plant cells. Thereafter, these monomeric precursors are exported into the cell wall, where they are polymerized and integrated into the wall?s matrix. Accordingly, the transport of monolignols across the cell membrane is a critical step affecting the deposition of lignin in the secondarily thickened cell wall. While the biosynthesis of monolignols is relatively well understood, the knowledge on the molecular basis for sequestering and transporting those lignin monomers is largely unknown. The aims of this project are the following: 1) through biochemical studies in gymnosperms and in angiosperms, to explore and clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the subcellular sequestration and transport of lignin monomers across the plasma membranes; and, 2) to identify and characterize the particular membrane transporters involved in lignin deposition during the formation of secondary cell walls. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project focuses on one of the most critical, yet least studied, metabolic steps in plant<br/>lignification.

The magnetosphere is the high altitude extension of Earth?s magnetic field, and spans the region of space where the geosynchronous satellites orbit the Earth. Our magnetosphere responds dramatically, even violently, to solar storms resulting in geomagnetic storms and drives the electric currents that cause aurora borealis and intensify the Van Allen radiation belts. The electric currents that flow between Earth?s uppermost atmosphere and the high-altitude magnetosphere are a reflection of the state of the entire region of Earth?s space environment and their measurement allows us to study the system. The Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) is the first ever system providing continuous, global measurements of these central electric currents and their dynamics as Earth?s magnetosphere responds to solar storms. AMPERE measures these currents by collecting the magnetic field data from all of the Iridium satellites, sampling the field from each satellite once every 20 seconds. There are 66 satellites in the Iridium constellation and AMPERE acquires data around the clock from every single one. With AMPERE we now have a system in place to provide continuous 24/7 pictures of what is really happening to near-Earth space, much like weather radars track the actual progress of weather fronts and major storm systems. Iridium is a private sector constellation of satellites, owned by Iridium Communications. AMPERE is the first-of-its-kind partnership between the commercial sector and research scientists to achieve something that the government could not have accomplished on its own. The expansion of this achievement under AMPERE-II will yield the first capability to observe the electrodynamics of near-Earth space with the global, continuous coverage necessary to resolve geomagnetic storms. It places the scientific community in position to make major advances across a range of challenges in magnetosphere and ionosphere science. AMPERE-II will harness the full potential of these new data to transform our understanding of Earth?s interaction with near-space and increase our ability to cope with the effects of solar storms.<br/><br/>Electric power is the cornerstone technology on which virtually all other infrastructures and services depend. Yet it is particularly vulnerable to adverse space weather effects. Protecting the nation?s power grids from the potential catastrophic effects of space weather is increasingly recognized as a critical element of ensuring the sustainability of modern society. Currents induced in the power grid during geomagnetic storms can actually melt the copper windings of transformers at the heart of most power distribution systems. Replacement of failed transformers can take weeks or months. Sprawling power lines act like antennas, picking up the currents and spreading the problem over a wide area. Accurate understanding and reliable prediction of the electric currents in the Earth?s magnetosphere and ionosphere that cause this space weather effect are crucial. If utility operators know a geomagnetic storm is coming and just how bad it?s going to be, they can take measures to reduce damage?e.g., disconnecting wires, shielding vulnerable electronics, or powering down critical hardware. A few hours without power is better than weeks or worse. AMPERE data continues to be the only global, continuous source for observations of the energy input into the ionosphere via electric currents that are critical for developing improved specification and forecasting of the ionospheric current systems that pose a potential hazard to the power grid. This makes the AMPERE project a critical component in our first line of defense against this potential space weather hazard. <br/><br/>AMPERE-II will provide key observations and derived products of the global Birkeland currents at timescales within geomagnetic storms and substorms together with analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on important science questions on magnetosphere and ionosphere coupling and dynamics, including: How does the M-I system respond to driving by plasma and magnetic fields of CMEs? What is the M-I system response to solar wind high-speed streams? What are the stages and sequences of activity onset and electrodynamic reconfigurations? What do they tell us about underlying governing processes? How are radiation belt dynamics and high-altitude magnetic reconnection related to and governed by global electrodynamics?

MAX phases are an exciting, and technologically important class of high-temperature materials but much remains to be understood, especially about the influence of chemistry on their properties, and their transition from brittle to ductile behavior (at elevated temperatures). This project addresses this challenge by synergistically combining experiments and computer simulations. A better understanding of the relationship between chemistry and mechanical stability may enable the faster deployment of MAX phases in technologies that benefit from higher operating temperatures, making it possible to develop more reliable and efficient power generation (and propulsion) systems. In addition to contributions to the science and technology of MAX phases, the project supports activities related to curriculum development, K-12 outreach, high school teacher training, mentoring and contributing to the professional training and development of undergraduate and graduate student researchers.<br/><br/>TECHINCAL DETAILS: The overall goal of this project is to investigate the finite-temperature structural and thermo-mechanical properties of MAX phases (comprised of an early transition metal (M), an A-group element and X which is either carbon and/or nitrogen) and their solid solutions through high-throughput experimental and computational approaches. Computations are being used for the rapid screening of materials while high-throughput synthesis allows the fine exploration of alloying effects on the thermal, mechanical and structural properties of a wide range of MAX structures. The project's major scientific goal is to elucidate the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the ductile-to-brittle transition in these materials under the hypothesis that the anharmonic nature of the motion of the M and A layers in the structures drives the onset of mechanical instability. Conventional electronic structure calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics will be used to investigate the ground state and anharmonic properties of MAX phases while spark plasma sintering will be used for the high-throughput synthesis of compositional variants of MAX compounds pre-screened by computations. The project addresses fundamental questions related to the compositional stability of MAX phases, the effect of composition and structure on their finite-temperature mechanical properties as well as the microscopic basis for the brittle-to-ductile transition. Understanding of the influence of chemistry on thermo-mechanical stability of these materials will enable their faster deployment in important technologies."

Indium-tin-oxide is currently the dominant transparent conducting oxide. However, it is expensive because of the Earth?s limited supply of indium, and alternatives are urgently needed for both organic light emitting diodes and solar cells. The experiments will use a combination of x-ray, ultraviolet and electron spectroscopies to measure the structural and chemical changes induced by the surface modification treatments, and electrical measurements to correlate these changes with the expected improvements in the zinc oxide hole injection properties. Device physics studies will be performed to measure how the expected improvements in the hole injection properties of the zinc oxide films influence the turn-on voltage, brightness, and power efficiency of complete organic light emitting diode test structures. Computational modeling and simulations using based on Density Functional Theory will assist the understanding obtained from the experimental research. <br/><br/>The combination of experimental and computational studies is expected to provide predictive models that facilitate rationally designed reductions in turn-on voltage, and power efficiency improvements in second generation organic light emitting diodes with zinc oxide anodes, and, fewer device layers.

In turn, reduced organic light emitting diode cost is expected to encourage their widespread use for general lighting, which can have a significant impact on reducing the amount of fossil fuel consumed by general lighting."

Stony Brook University, brings together a small business-academia innovation team to capitalize on emergent opportunities in thermal spray (TS) deposition of functional oxides for applications in high temperature sensing and electrical energy conversion systems. It has long been appreciated that successful development of functional oxide deposition via TS (a platform technology) would provide an enabling new capability for a high rate, economical approach to large area deposition of components in fuel cells, batteries, and a range of thick film sensors. Many of these inventions have been contemplated for several decades but have not been translated into innovative applications, largely due to the complexity in materials science of TS systems as well as to limitations in process science and control. Over the last decade, much has changed in both knowledge and technology which has resulted in a reconsideration of the capability for functional materials systems. However, in order to push the capability of TS to play an active role in thick film manufacturing, new process science ideologies aimed at improving functional properties and enhancing reliability must be implemented. Furthermore, scientific endeavors in academia must be leveraged with entrepreneurial pursuits in small businesses to demonstrate the viability of TS to meet rigorous requirements in sensor and energy systems. The intellectual merit stems from the ability to introduce academically derived, sophisticated scientific concepts such as advanced diagnostics and process maps into industrial manufacturing practice. Successful development of the proposed technologies through the PFI will not only have immediate impact among the small business innovation partners, but also will provide a framework for consideration of TS expansion into the arena of functional materials. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are numerous. Successful consideration of TS in sensors and energy systems will open the door to wide ranging opportunities including thick film devices, mesoscale electronics, and photocatalytic surfaces. It has the potential to bring down manufacturing costs and provide scaling for fuel cells and batteries enabling their wide spread utilization. It will also distill confidence in TS technology and enhance capabilities of small business service providers for both traditional and novel applications. Effective interactions among graduate, undergraduate students, and industrial innovators can influence and inspire a spirit of innovation in a generation of both engineering and business students. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of this project includere the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of the lead academic institution, Stony Brook University (Department of Materials Science and Engineering), and Boston University (Department of Mechanical Engineering); two small businesses: MesoScribe Technologies (St. James, NY) and Surface Modification Systems (Santa Fe Springs, CA); and one large business: Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA).

In geology, rocks are the key to the past; in many cases they represent the only resource available to study ""deep time."" However, no known whole rocks exists from before 4 billion years ago. The reservoir of known terrestrial material is limited to very rare ""grains of sand"" found in only a handful of sediments throughout the world. In the absence of the original rock that hosted these ""grains of sand,"" - or specifically the mineral zircon - there are numerous challenges. This research will address these problems through two complementary approaches. The first involves measurements to deduce the chemical composition of these very rare minerals (zircons), while the second involves the synthesis of the mineral in the controlled environment of a high pressure, high temperature experimental geology laboratory. These experiments - where pressure, temperature, and magma composition can be varied - will serve as a stepping stone to interpret the chemistry of the most ancient known terrestrial samples. The application of these experiments to natural samples will result in new knowledge about the environments and conditions of the earliest Earth (including the composition of magmas), and is therefore a key source of information to understand the evolution of Earth through time. Broader impacts of this work also include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in novel high pressure / high temperature crystal and glass synthesis techniques. Synthetic glasses and crystals make up a component of many consumer products today. Students will also conduct measurements of these materials using modern analytical technology such as a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. And finally, secondary school science teachers will benefit from laboratory demonstrations that explain how geologists determine the ages of ancient rocks and minerals; they will also participate in the development of simple diagrams that explain key concepts of geology and geochemistry that they can then use for instruction in their classes. <br/><br/>The experimental work for this project will be conducted using a piston cylinder apparatus at the University of Rochester. Zircons will: (i) be synthesized in silicic melts; or (ii) approach equilibrium elemental and isotopic compositions through time series experiments in the presence of fluids. Partition coefficients/isotope compositions of run products will be determined for light stable elements in zircon and co-existing phases. The first goal is to robustly calibrate the incorporation light elements into the zircon lattice as a function of melt composition, melt structure, and temperature. Second, the developed calibrations will be applied to Archean and Hadean zircons. These experiments and the application of the results will play a fundamental role in the quest to link chemical signatures preserved in ancient zircons with early crystal processes. This work will also extend knowledge of the zircon parent rock composition long since gone."

Central to developing a cogent explanation is quantifying the spatial and temporal scales over which such high temperature prevailed: short spatial and temporal scales imply localized plutonism or fluid flow, whereas long scales indicate larger scale processes. Southern Madagascar represents a key place for studying ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism. There are, however, two key pieces of information missing from our understanding of this otherwise excellent study area: a quantification of how peak temperature varied with depth and with position at a specific depth, and a quantification of how temperature evolved with time. Three endmember hypotheses for the cause of ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism--subduction beneath an arc, collisional thickening and plutonism, and extreme collisional thickening--will be tested using relatively new techniques: titanium-in-zircon, titanium-in-quartz, and zirconium-in-rutile thermometry and pseudosection modeling, in conjunction with laser-ablation split-stream uranium/thorium-lead dates and trace elements of monazite and zircon.<br/><br/>Because Southern Madagascar is an archetypal example of exceptionally hot crust, ideas developed there can be applied globally. This proposal is targeted toward understanding how exceptionally hot crust develops, but it will also impact the following questions: What processes are active today beneath hot collision orogens such as Tibet? How do the rheology, topographic, density, and composition of Earth?s crust evolve during collisions? What role did Madagascar play in the evolution of the East African-Antarctica Orogen?

Understanding the enrichment history of galaxies is therefore crucial to understanding the star formation and feedback processes that are central to galaxy evolution. Absorption lines of damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorbers in the spectra of background quasars or gamma-ray burst afterglows provide the most sensitive tools to measure the heavy element content of distant galaxies. High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed some interesting puzzles, especially relating to variations in metallicities and enrichment. Current and proposed large telescopes will greatly expand the observational database, especially at high redshift, but unfortunately essential atomic data - both oscillator strengths and recombination coefficients - are highly uncertain or unknown for most elements beyond Magnesium in the periodic table. These gaps in the existing atomic database are the greatest weakness in deriving abundances from spectra and realizing the scientific potential of the observations. This project will improve that situation by carrying out the following steps: 1) calculate more accurate oscillator strengths for transitions of all relevant ions from Aluminum to Zinc using state-of-the-art quantal codes; 2) calculate dielectronic recombination coefficients for all relevant ions of key elements; 3) incorporate these data into the widely used photoionization code 'Cloudy'; 4) apply the new 'Cloudy' models to existing and new spectral data; and 5) provide feedback to the atomic theory from the observational and modeling results (the last and most crucial step).<br/><br/>This study will help to determine whether the current picture of chemical evolution of galaxies is accurate, while providing a much-needed improvement in atomic data and photoionization modeling. Because the team combines expertise in atomic physics, plasma simulations, and observational spectroscopy, they are uniquely qualified to carry out this work.<br/><br/>The improvements to the widely available modeling tool 'Cloudy' will be of immediate benefit to other areas of astrophysics ranging from star-forming clouds to active galactic nuclei, because that utility is used extensively and cited in over 200 publications each year.

Due to the make-up of the team, it also enhances the quality and diversity of the scientific workforce in a geographical region with few astronomers, and especially very few minority or women astronomers."

The process begins when narrow files of cells are recruited from a field of cells in a pattern that predicts the final vein pattern. These cells subsequently develop into the procambium, the tissue that will ultimately produce the veins. The plant hormone auxin plays a pivotal role in this process. Directional canals of auxin flow determine the paths of recruitment of cells into the procambium. Polar localization of PIN auxin transport proteins, to the plasma membrane on one side of the cells of the developing procambium, results in these canals of auxin flow. The focus of this project is on the role of the Sec14-related proteins, PATELLIN-1 and -2 (PATL1/2), in the formation of a continuous vascular pattern in the plant model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana. Molecular genetic and imaging approaches will be used to test the hypothesis that PATL1/2 act in a signaling pathway that regulates PIN auxin transport protein localization in the developing vascular system. Completion of the project will provide insight into the complex process of vascular pattern formation. This enhanced understanding of vascular development may prove useful in designing genetic modifications of plants used for biofuels since the xylem of the veins makes up the bulk of plant biomass, a valuable source of renewable energy. This project also stands to broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the biological sciences; Wellesley College is a private liberal arts college for women with a commitment to diversity. Undergraduates will be collaborators in all aspects of the scientific process, an experience that will provide excellent preparation for advanced training and which often translates into careers in science and medicine."

The primary goal is to provide students with research experiences that stimulate an interest in science and technology, exposes them to techniques used in experimental high energy physics, allows the development of global relationships and prepares them for careers in science and technology. The project on which the students will work has a focus centered on understanding the behavior of extremely dense matter, similar to that existing a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This is achieved by colliding atomic nuclei at very high energies and studying the remnants of these collisions using highly sophisticated detectors. The students involved in this project will analyze the resulting sub-atomic particles generated by these collisions, and will contribute to the design of new detectors that will enable even more sensitive experiments in the future.<br/><br/>As stated earlier, the focus of ALICE at CERN is to understand the behavior of matter at very high density, similar to the matter that existed a fraction a second after the Big Bang. This state of matter, consisting of a very hot and dense medium of quarks and gluons, is often referred to as a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). By colliding nuclei at very high energies it is possible to create a QGP in a controlled environment that facilitates the study of its properties. Chicago State University (CSU) students will investigate the flavor characteristics, specifically strangeness, of jets resulting from high-energy proton-proton and lead-lead collisions and their use as probes in the study of QGP formation. In addition, CSU students will be involved in a research and development program devoted to the upgrade of ALICE sub-detectors, thereby participating in the hardware development of important components in the ALICE experiment.<br/><br/>Collaboration with a large international laboratory such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN allows students to work with world-class scientists and ""state of the art"" technology, thus preparing them for STEM careers. Additionally, a program such as this has the potential of creating a cadre of students who become ambassadors for STEM; students who demonstrate to their peers the benefits of pursuing careers in science, engineering, math and technology. Also, students who participate in this program may serve as mentors and role models for students of high school age and younger, thereby, contributing to the creation of a pipeline of students actively preparing for careers in STEM."

The aim is to provide an accurate, practical, detailed description of these coherent wave structures that is useful for applications in nanomagnetism and the fluid dynamics of dissipationless, dispersive media. Motivated by recent experiments, time-periodic, localized solutions of a modified Landau-Lifshitz equation that incorporates a spin transfer torque forcing term to compensate damping will be computed and studied analytically using asymptotic methods. These magnetic droplet solitons and their generalizations have potential for technological applications. Another research front will be developed involving modulated nonlinear wavetrains or dispersive shock waves (DSWs). The generation of DSWs represents a universal mechanism to resolve hydrodynamic singularities in dispersive media such as water waves, plasma, optics, interfacial fluids, Bose-Einstein condensates, and two-phase, viscously deformable fluids. Theoretical studies will focus upon central questions of modern DSW theory including loss of genuine nonlinearity/strict hyperbolicity in the modulation equations, multi-dimensional DSWs, and stability. In collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, the principal investigator will undertake experiments involving a viscous fluid conduit system in order to make quantitative measurements of DSW properties for comparison with theory.<br/><br/>When wave properties intrinsically depend upon the wave amplitude, novel physical behavior can arise. With a view toward applications, this project encompasses two classes of these nonlinear waves: solitary waves in nanomagnetism and shock waves in dispersive media. Spintronics encompasses the effort to develop information transport, processing, and storage using the electron's spin in addition to its charge, for example, to continue Moore's Law (the doubling of the number of transistors per unit area every eighteen months) beyond present technological limitations. The spatially localized spin excitations in a nanomagnet to be studied in this project possess features that hold great promise for future spintronic applications. Viscous shock waves that form when a projectile exceeds the speed of sound in air are commonly understood. The dispersive shock waves studied in this project are of a very different type, lacking dissipation and realized as expanding, oscillatory wavetrains. A fluid experiment will be developed to carefully measure these shock properties while also being used as an educational, outreach, and demonstration tool, providing young mathematicians direct experience with nonlinear waves. Presentations at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will provide the general public with exposure to this fascinating field."

However, the robustness of these tori and the existence of remnants upon destruction are understood only in two-dimensions. The PI proposes to study tori of three-dimensional maps, and to generalize the residue criterion discovered by Greene and the anti-integrable limit discovered by Aubry. Studies will include symmetry reduction, invariance, and the loss of integrability for general, structure-preserving maps and flows. An important application is the optimization of mixing in open duct flows used in the continuous blending of materials. Our current understanding of the mixing process is, for the most part, limited to flows that are in essence two-dimensional and either closed or recycling. Transport in three-dimensional systems can be quantified by the flux through the destroyed structures, computed using a generalized action based on Lagrangian forms, thereby obtaining accurate and computationally efficient volume fluxes. The PI and students will use the concept of transitory dynamics to quantify and optimize transport in open flows. The extension to episodic and more general time-dependence will clarify the definition of Lagrangian coherent structures in aperiodic dynamics.<br/><br/>The complexity of patterns obtained by mixing a passive scalar in a fluid can be observed by anyone pouring cream into hot coffee. That this process is not fully understood is perhaps less obvious. If the flow is sufficiently turbulent then mixing is rapid and uniformity is not hard to achieve. If, however, the flow is slow, on a small scale, or viscous, then mixing is much more difficult. Yet, such processes are important to many applications including the development of micrometer scale bioreactors and effective mixing of polymer and granular materials. A predictive theory for laminar mixing would also contribute to the understanding of climate modeling and pollution dispersal in the atmosphere as well as nutrient dispersal and spawning efficiencies for sea life. Mixing in laminar flows proceeds by stretching and folding due to chaotic motion that gives rise to fine-scale structure where diffusion is effective. Any measure of mixing requires quantification of chaos and its concomitant transport. Chaotic motion in incompressible fluids has some similarities to that in conservative dynamics. The later models are used to predict the lifetime of particles in accelerators, obtain rates for simple chemical reactions, calculate confinement times in plasma fusion devices, understand the spectra of highly excited atomic systems, and design efficient spacecraft trajectories. For chaotic dynamics, prediction of specific trajectories is difficult; nevertheless, chaos can be profitably utilized, for example, to improve efficiency of spacecraft trajectories, by judiciously applying small course corrections, or to enhance the lifetimes of particles in confinement devices and the rates of chemical reactions. In this study, chaos will be used to optimize mixing with the goal of obtaining practical designs for open, three-dimensional, mixing devices."

These equations describe fluid motions for gases and liquids under quite general conditions, from laminar to turbulent flows, on scales ranging from below a millimeter to astronomical lengths. Consequently, their study has wide-ranging applications in aeronautical sciences, in meteorology, in the petroleum industry, in plasma physics, and more recently, in biophysical fluid dynamics. The inherent nonlinear and multi-scale nature of these equations make the problem of weather forecasting and understanding climate evolution challenging. The investigators develop analytical and computational tools to study the long-term behavior of the fundamental governing equations of the atmosphere and climate. A main focus is to connect recently developed techniques of data assimilation with the theory of statistical solutions of these equations. This in turn facilitates the incorporation of vast amounts of weather/climate data, collected over a long period of time, into mathematical models of weather and climate, potentially leading to improved statistical prediction. Graduate students are engaged in the work of the project. <br/><br/>The investigators study several aspects of turbulent flows, including the time of existence of smooth solutions, statistical properties, and the long-term dynamics on the strong or weak global attractor, in a new class of functional spaces that is contained in all Sobolev classes. A key feature of this class is that the nonlinear evolution equation satisfies a differential inequality that is almost linear. This functional class has the property that it can absorb derivatives, which has the effect of making the nonlinear term milder, with potential applications to a wide class of nonlinear evolution equations. For certain types of initial data, this yields a better existence time for the Navier-Stokes equations than some well-known Sobolev functional classes. This new class of functional spaces is employed to study the finite-dimensional properties of statistical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, via the determining modes, nodes, and determining forms. Furthermore, the investigators develop data assimilation techniques for statistical solutions of hydrodynamic equations. Statistical solutions are directly related to the average physical quantities with which engineers are concerned. They provide a bridge from the time average of physical observables such as energy, enstrophy, and heat transfer to ensemble measures on the phase space. The techniques developed in this project should have immediate engineering and scientific applications."

This project will lay the groundwork for a new approach to engineer genetic resistance, based on the fact that most pathogens depend on the plant host to supply essential nutrients for their growth. By identifying and engineering the plant genes responsible for nutrient transfer so that they can no longer be used by the pathogen, it could be possible to cut the pathogen's supply lines and prevent disease development. This approach could provide resistance against a wide range of pathogens and would be very difficult for pathogens to overcome by co-evolution.<br/><br/>This project focuses on plant-encoded transporters of amino acids and sugar that are co-opted by Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) to facilitate nutrient acquisition. This project will provide new insights into the contributions of host genes to pathogen nutrition, and will investigate mechanisms through which transporters are co-opted to serve the invader. These aspects of plant-pathogen interactions are critically important but inadequately understood and under-studied. Reverse genetics will be used to identify amino acid transporters necessary for colonization of Arabidopsis by Hpa. Double mutants and RNAi lines will be used to assess genetic redundancy and physiological compensation. Mutants will be studied to determine the impact on infection by other pathogens, and whether the associated phenotypes are due to perturbation of innate immune responses. A subset of transporters will be examined at the molecular level to evaluate the importance of their differential expression and subcellular localization for pathogen nutrient acquisition. Biochemical properties and effects of amino acid transporters on flux across the plasma membrane will be determined to identify their role in the plant. Finally, a novel approach combining metabolomics and labeled nutrients will be used to test the importance of amino acid transporters for pathogen nutrition.

Specifically, intense (up to MV/cm) THz electric fields will be generated by tilted pulse front generation in lithium niobate crystals and/or plasma filamentation in gaseous media in order to pump the softest intramolecular and intermolecular modes in target systems to high degrees of excitation. The resulting state distributions and internal dynamics will be probed, with complete eigenstate resolution, by chirped pulse-Fourier Transform MicroWave spectroscopy.

Storms in space can trigger explosively (like earthquakes and volcanoes), driving strong electric currents through the upper atmosphere, which induce currents in the solid earth that can disrupt power grids; redistributing the charged particles within the embedded layers of the ionosphere, which can interfere with GPS navigation systems; and heating the upper atmosphere, which increases drag degrading the orbits of satellites. Global models of the high-altitude geospace environment are electromagnetic in nature and can follow these rapid changes in the magnetic fields and currents surrounding Earth, not so models of the magnetically coupled lower altitude ionosphere/upper atmosphere, which are electrostatic in nature. This proposal is focused on the development of a first-of-its-kind global electromagnetic model of the ionosphere/upper atmosphere system that, if successful will ultimately be incorporated into next-generation space weather models. This project is appropriate for the EAGER program. It is high risk but the reward, if it succeeds, is a new generation of global magnetosphere-ionosphere models that could potentially change views on some of the most fundamental aspects of the coupling between space and the upper atmosphere during the rapid onset of disturbances and possibly trigger new discoveries by supplying predictions of other effects to search for in the observations. The results will ultimately improve capabilities for space weather prediction and are potentially of interest to the study of planetary atmospheres, accretion disks, nebula, and the interstellar medium. The training of a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell on this grant is an excellent means of transferring knowledge about this complex numerical methodology to the next generation of space scientists and is a near-term broader impact.<br/><br/>Present models of the ionosphere-thermosphere assume that the magnetic field close to Earth is constant. But fast time-scale processes like explosive auroral activity are not correctly represented unless the changes in the magnetic field produced by electric currents closing through the ionosphere are solved for self-consistently. A major impediment to developing such a model using present explicit numerical algorithms has been the intractably short time steps (as short as 1 millionth of a second at 100 kilometers altitude) required to maintain stability of the solution, which dictate unrealistically long computer run times in order to follow the evolution of the system. The PI is implementing new numerical technology not widely known in the geospace community based on implicit algorithms that enable the use of much longer time steps, and also optimizing the model to run on high-performance computers. The new electromagnetic model will then be used in a number of numerical experiments to explore controversial features of rapidly developing disturbances in the coupled geospace - upper atmosphere system."

For the ""formation stage"", the project intends to answer the question of how the first black hole (BH) seeds formed within the early universe by numerically simulating the coupling of large-scale baryonic structures and dark-matter halos to small-scale collapse of primordial gas disks into massive BH seeds. For the ""fueling stage"" the project aims to explore the growth of the BH seed into a SMBH from galaxy-scale accretion flows to SMBH mergers. Finally, for the ""feedback stage"" the goal is to explore the mechanisms by which the SMBHs at the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGN) couple to the inter-cluster plasma on cosmological scales. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs.

Such a camera can capture images at a frame rate of ~50 trillion frames per second, recording 3 ~ 60 frames in a single-shot. Here, the enabling technologies include ultra-broadband spectrum generation, ultrafast optical pulse shaping, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging.

In applications, they can be used as physical biomarkers for diagnostic purposes or can be modulated for therapeutic purposes such as cancer cure or wound healing. Membrane potential, the voltage across the plasma membrane of cells, is a key bioelectrical signal for important cellular activities, such as proliferation, migration and differentiation. Recent studies have revealed that the membrane potential of cells has far more complicated spatial distributions even at single cell level. The role of these fine structures is still not clear and needs to be explored. One hypothesis is that these potential fine structures contain important information to guide essential cell activities and behaviors. This project will develop advanced scientific instruments using nanotechnology and study these fine potential structures at single molecule and single cell level.

The PI's long term goal is to understand bioelectricity at single cell and single molecule level using innovative nanopipette and SICM based integrated techniques that can achieve single molecule and single cell analysis and imaging under physiological conditions. Bioelectric signals are ubiquitous and play very important roles in biological systems. Steady extracellular potential microdomains around individual non-excitable cell have recently been revealed and they may carry instructive information in signaling pathways. To understand this newly discovered phenomenon, it is very important to quantitatively map the potential distributions around the periphery of one or a cluster of living cells with high spatial resolution in an extended time period. Conical-shaped glass or quartz nanopipettes have attracted increased attentions in recent years. They can be directly used as nanopores for single molecule biosensing. In addition, it can be used as sharp probes for an emerging scanning probe microscopy technique, SICM, to reveal the morphology of living cells with a high spatial resolution. To achieve the research objective, systematic approach will be used and three highly interrelated research tasks are planned: 1. Develop multifunctional SICM techniques for extracellular potential mapping. 2. Characterize the system using model samples in well-controlled environment. 3. Investigate extracellular extracellular potential microdomains of living cells with submicron resolution. These techniques are potentially transformative for bioelectricity studies at single cell level and can also be applied to a wide variety of areas, including biosensing, drug delivery and screening and cytotoxicity.

Of fundamental importance for understanding magmatic evolution and planetary formation processes are detailed geochemical studies of large simple igneous systems. Layered mafic-ultramafic igneous complexes are not only useful for understanding magmatic differentiation processes but also important economically for being the main source of platinum group elements, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Fe ore deposits. Iron isotope studies can help unravel the formation processes of these igneous complexes as well as their mineral deposits because the different isotopes of Fe can potentially partition into different phases during diverse processes, including crystallization of minerals from the melt, assimilation of country rocks, and reactions between rocks and late-stage hydrothermal fluids. Within individual crystals Fe isotopes can also diffuse through various minerals at different rates and may also reflect equilibrium (magmatic) or non-equilibrium (kinetic) processes. Improvements in the precision of Fe stable isotope measurements of bulk rocks and minerals by multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) show that significant variations exist in high-temperature mafic and ultramafic terrestrial crustal and mantle igneous rocks, lunar mafic rocks, and meteorites. These findings promise success for understanding magmatic differentiation and planetary formation processes. However, the current knowledge of Fe isotope compositions of individual minerals and fractionations among them in these rocks is still limited, and the causes, mechanisms, and implications of Fe isotope fractionations in high-temperature terrestrial and extraterrestrial igneous systems are still poorly understood. Only a very limited number of igneous intrusions have been investigated in detail with Fe isotopes. In addition, in situ Fe isotope measurements of individual minerals in extraterrestrial rocks are not available and only very few exist for terrestrial rocks. This means that Fe isotope compositions previously measured in bulk minerals may well be, in many cases, an average of the complex compositions recorded during crystal growth, diffusion, or late-stage hydrothermal alteration. This project will determine the extents, causes, and mechanisms of Fe isotope fractionations in a simple high-temperature magmatic system combining Fe and O isotope analysis of bulk-rocks and minerals with high-spatial resolution in situ Fe and O isotope analysis of minerals by femtosecond laser ablation (fs-LA) MC-ICP-MS and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), respectively, in the mafic-ultramafic layered intrusion of Skaergaard, Greenland, the most studied intrusive complex on Earth. This intrusion exemplifies a highly differentiated magma chamber originated from a single, large, magma body that underwent extensive, closed-system evolution through fractional crystallization that later underwent hydrothermal alteration. The results of this research will help understand the processes of formation of mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions and their host magmatic mineral deposits and has implications for understanding planetary differentiation processes.<br/><br/>The emphasis of this project is on systematic, high resolution, inter-mineral Fe isotope fractionations and in situ intra-mineral Fe isotope compositions (by fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS). Because fs-LA-MC-ICP-MS is a new technique in geochemistry, this research will help develop the method that may ultimately benefit the broader geoscience community. Detailed bulk-rock and mineral Fe and O isotope compositions combined with in situ Fe isotope compositions, mineral chemistry, O isotope cooling temperatures, bulk-rock major and trace element compositions, and modeling will produce the most comprehensive and detailed study of a single large igneous intrusion. Oxygen isotope compositions will help discern high-temperature magmatic Fe isotope compositions (equilibrium) from kinetic and late-stage hydrothermal effects. All these data together will help identify the origin of the measured fractionations (fractional crystallization, chemical diffusion, thermal diffusion, late-stage hydrothermal alteration). The inter-mineral Fe isotope fractionation factors as a function of temperature calculated for Skaergaard will be useful for understanding those in other terrestrial igneous systems, lunar and Martian rocks, and other planetary bodies. Because large samples are hard to obtain from meteorites, this study will provide much needed information to determine the best approach for extraterrestrial sample studies. The results of this work will improve our understanding of large-scale evolution of Fe isotopes at the intrusion level as well as small scale, Fe isotope heterogeneities within crystals. This project combines the expertise of mineralogy, petrology, economic geology, geochemistry, and Fe and O isotope geochemistry of the PI and collaborators from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This project will support an early career female scientist, fund two M.S. theses and undergraduate student researchers, and support the development of the physical infrastructure for research on state-of-the-art high-temperature isotope geochemistry at East Carolina University. This collaboration will also provide graduate and undergraduate students at ECU the experience of working with state-of-the-art analytical facilities at UW-Madison and interact with top leaders in geochemistry."

However, devices that efficiently and reliably emit electrons into vacuum have been challenging due to their low current density and poor reliability. The proposed project, a collaboration between Purdue University and Ohio State University, aims to demonstrate new designs for vacuum emitters to enable them to operate reliably at high current densities. Two complementary approaches involving two different semiconductors - Silicon and Gallium Nitride will be used to demonstrate vacuum emitters, guided by detailed electronic and thermal modeling techniques. The proposed work will enable realization of high-performance vacuum electronic devices that can be integrated on semiconductor chips at the micrometer scale. These microscale high current density emitters would surpass the current state-of-art and could enable a large array of new applications that exploit vacuum electronics for display, high data-rate communications, high-temperature electronics, and imaging. The project will lead to training and education of graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary and novel area of semiconductor technology, and could lead to several new commercially relevant applications for vacuum electronic circuits and systems.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will combine the complementary expertise in Si fabrication and vacuum electronics at Purdue University, and III-nitride heterostructure and polarization engineering at Ohio State University to demonstrate reliable high current density emitters. A new approach to Si field emitters will be investigated to take advantage of current saturation effects in Silicon with fairly low carrier concentration, The Si emitters will be designed to control current density through lattice and ionized impurity scattering limited transport. A parallel approach using heterostructure and polarization engineering will be pursued to achieve highly efficient field emission in planar III-nitride semiconductor structures. III-nitride semiconductors have intrinsic polarization that enables large voltages to be dropped across nanometer scale distances. This enables field engineering to align the conduction band within the semiconductor with the vacuum level outside. The polarization engineering concepts will be combined with ballistic transport in ultrascaled structures to achieve efficient field emission from III-nitride semiconductor surfaces. The proposed device will enable high current density field emission in planar geometries that could be advantageous for several applications. Sophisticated modeling techniques including 2-dimensional electro-thermal simulations and Monte Carlo simulations of transport in heterostructures will be developed at Purdue University and Ohio State University to design and evaluate the vacuum emitters in both Silicon and III-nitride material systems. Development and demonstration of micro-fabrication technology for integrated vacuum electronic devices will be done. The proposed work would lead to better understanding of field emission from engineered nanoscale structures and III-nitride semiconductors. The concepts proposed here use promising and novel approaches for overcoming challenges related to high current density emitters, and could therefore have transformative impact on the science and applications of vacuum microelectronics."

This work focuses on minimizing the computational cost of approximating solutions to these systems in order to develop practical simulations for this type of problem. The bottom line is to further develop discretization and solution algorithms that yield the most accuracy per computational cost. This is achieved by deriving discrete energy laws for MHD systems and proving that they are consistent with the continuous mathematical model. The investigators accomplish this by using the Energetic-Variational Approach (EVA) to further investigate the MHD model itself and determining which ""flavor"" of the MHD equations is the simplest model that captures the relevant physics. One of the main issues with using finite-element methods for solving complex fluid and electromagnetic problems has been the precise preservation of divergence-free solutions. Here, the investigators analyze discretization methods that satisfy these quantities accurately, while remaining amenable to efficient solution. Finally, the main bottleneck in the discretization methods used so far is the slow convergence of the linear solvers. By further developing multigrid methods for systems of partial differential equations, the investigators create a robust and efficient algorithm for these complex systems.<br/><br/>The development of an efficient simulation framework for MHD systems has a major impact on the study of fusion energy, as this model is used to describe various phenomena that occur in fusion reactors, including tearing mode and sawtooth instabilities. With projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Lab attempting to obtain sustainable fusion energy, scientific computing in fields related to these projects is critical.

A detection would deliver the first observational constraints on models of structure formation and on the formation of the first stars and black holes in the Universe. LEDA will develop and integrate signal processing instrumentation into the new first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). This comprises a large-N correlator serving all 512 dipole antennas of the LWA-1, leveraging a packetized CASPER architecture and combining FPGAs and GPUs for the F and X stages. Iterative calibration and imaging will rely on warped snapshot imaging and be drawn from a GPU-enabled library (CUWARP) that is designed specifically to support wide-field full polarization imaging with fixed dipole arrays. Calibration techniques will include correction for ionospheric refraction and direction dependent dipole gains, and exploration of pulsar data analysis to improve performance. Accurate calibration and imaging will be crucial requirements for LEDA, necessary to subtract the bright foreground sky and detect the faint neutral Hydrogen signal.

Stage two of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA2) is one example.<br/><br/>When did the first stars form? These stars are expected to be much more massive than the stars that are around us today. Did supermassive black holes form at the same time, earlier, or later? One of the great challenges of cosmology today is the study of these first generation objects. Their formation is widely hypothesized to have begun about 100 million years after the Big Bang, but no data are available to test this theory. The only available means to study the Universe at so young an age (just 1% of what it is today) is via electromagnetic radiation from the intergalactic medium between the stars and black holes. Today, this is hot and ionized plasma, but in the early Universe it was a vast reservoir of cold neutral Hydrogen gas that fed the formation of the first stars and black holes and radiated long wavelength radiation copiously.<br/><br/>The LEDA project seeks to apply frontier radio astronomical techniques to make the first detection of this signal. LEDA will build a ""radio camera"" for deployment on the Long Wavelength Array, a radio telescope in New Mexico whose first 100m-diameter aperture was recently completed. The LEDA camera will combine several innovative technologies and data analysis techniques, giving students and young scientists the opportunity to join in cutting-edge science and development of the most advanced tools. In particular, LEDA will harness the massive computing power and flexibility of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) - the engines that power video games - to make instantaneous images of nearly the whole sky at up to 10 meters wavelength (10 million times longer than visible radiation).<br/><br/>From these images the light of our and other galaxies will be subtracted with high accuracy, enabling a search for signals from the dawn of the Universe.

From 160 to 50 million years ago, the western U.S. was tectonically similar to modern day western South America, which is characterized by high elevation mountains (the Andes) that formed in the continental crust above an actively subducting oceanic plate. When subduction ceased along western North America, a new regime of widespread crustal extension began, resulting in localized exposures at the surface of deep levels of the ancient mountain belt. This project will examine the Funeral Mountains in Death Valley National Park, which the principal investigators hypothesize records the cycle of mountain building followed by extension. In particular, they hypothesize that the same fault (a thrust fault) initially responsible for substantial burial and thickening of the crust was reactivated twice during the exhumation of the rocks to the surface. They further argue that the reactivation of thrust faults may be a common phenomenon in the western U.S., explaining many similar occurrences in other mountain ranges. Rocks in the Funeral Mountains are ideal for testing this hypothesis due to excellent exposures and abundant rocks suitable for study. This project will accomplish many benefits to society as identified by NSF: (1) helping the U.S. maintain competitiveness and leadership in the global Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce; students who participate in the project (three graduate students and five undergraduates) will develop high-level expertise and teamwork experience in a STEM discipline; (2) increased public scientific literacy by dissemination of findings to the academic community through presentations at professional conferences and publications, and to the general public and Death Valley enthusiasts by presenting at meetings of the Death Valley Natural History Association, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, and the Nevada Geological Society; (3) development of research partnerships between two universities as part of collaborative research efforts, and the development of research infrastructure at each institution; and; (4) the investigators seek to engage the full participation of women and underrepresented students in STEM education through targeted recruiting efforts.<br/><br/>Reactivation and tectonic inheritance are long-recognized phenomena, important to our understanding of how the continental lithosphere deforms. The thesis of this proposal is that many Tertiary detachment faults and shear zones in the western US reactivate faults or sub-planar zones of earlier deformation. The Funeral Mountains metamorphic core complex of the Death Valley region represents an ideal locality in the Sevier-Laramide hinterland to evaluate the role of tectonic reactivation in the development of metamorphic core complexes, as well as to resolve important details regarding the tectonic history that predates Tertiary extension. We hypothesize that the Boundary Canyon detachment fault, which underwent greater than 40 kilometers of top-the northwest slip in the Miocene, formed as the last reactivation of a major Jurassic thrust of opposite slip that was responsible for deep burial and regional metamorphism of the footwall. We propose a multi-faceted approach to evaluate the hypothesis of protracted tectonic reactivation through detailed studies along the metamorphic and strain gradient that includes: (1) field mapping and structural analysis, (2) petrographic, microstructural, and kinematic analyses aided by Electron Backscatter Diffraction analysis of quartz-rich rocks, (3) applying petrochronology (Laser Ablation Split Stream Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) to date accessory minerals (metamorphic titanite, monazite, xenotime, and zircon overgrowths) and Lutetium-Hafnium dating of garnet in garnet amphibolites, and (4) determining the metamorphic conditions and prograde pressure-temperature paths to evaluate the prograde burial history, possible grade discordances across major shear zones, and the regional thrust-induced paleodip.

The EAF is used mainly to determine the composition, including major, minor, and trace elements, of a large range of materials including obsidian, ceramic, clay, synthesized glass and metals from all around the world and natural terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks. This new state-of-the-art instrumentation will be used to establish extensive new datasets of archaeological, cultural and geological materials that directly informs hypotheses about ancient trade and exchange, technology, and their relationship to the development of social complexity around the world and the origin and the evolution of Earth and the solar system. This new instrument will contribute to the research and training of undergraduate, graduate students and young researchers. They will be initiated into the analytical process using ICP-MS by undertaking the analysis itself and will be trained in method development, the statistical processing of the data, and interpretation. Results of the research at the EAF will inform future exhibits and education activities at the Field Museum, Art Institute and Oriental Institute, which educate hundreds of thousands of school children and millions of visitors annually. <br/><br/>A new ICP-MS, will not only increase inter-disciplinary collaborations at the Field Museum but also stimulate collaborative efforts between the Field Museum and other Chicago-based institutions. Among those are the new Northwestern University-Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies, the Oriental Institute (University of Chicago), and the Chicago Center for Cosmochemistry (C3), comprised of the three-institutions Field Museum, University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, to enhance training, scientific research and exchange in the fields of Anthropology, Cosmochemistry, Geochemistry, Materials Science and Engineering. The connection of the EAF with the Field Museum, The Art Institute and the Oriental Institute collections will be a unique opportunity to linking leading scholars and graduate students to those institutions, extensive collections and giving them the tools to analyze these one of a kind assemblages to significantly enhance understanding of the role of cultural production in the development of complex societies. The C3 enables their scientists to access the world-class collections of meteorites, terrestrial rocks and minerals from the Field Museum and analyze them using the specialized analytical tools at its institutions and at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University with whom we have established a close collaboration."

From 160 to 50 million years ago, the western U.S. was tectonically similar to modern day western South America, which is characterized by high elevation mountains (the Andes) that formed in the continental crust above an actively subducting oceanic plate. When subduction ceased along western North America, a new regime of widespread crustal extension began, resulting in localized exposures at the surface of deep levels of the ancient mountain belt. This project will examine the Funeral Mountains in Death Valley National Park, which the principal investigators hypothesize records the cycle of mountain building followed by extension. In particular, they hypothesize that the same fault (a thrust fault) initially responsible for substantial burial and thickening of the crust was reactivated twice during the exhumation of the rocks to the surface. They further argue that the reactivation of thrust faults may be a common phenomenon in the western U.S., explaining many similar occurrences in other mountain ranges. Rocks in the Funeral Mountains are ideal for testing this hypothesis due to excellent exposures and abundant rocks suitable for study. This project will accomplish many benefits to society as identified by NSF: (1) helping the U.S. maintain competitiveness and leadership in the global Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce; students who participate in the project (three graduate students and five undergraduates) will develop high-level expertise and teamwork experience in a STEM discipline; (2) increased public scientific literacy by dissemination of findings to the academic community through presentations at professional conferences and publications, and to the general public and Death Valley enthusiasts by presenting at meetings of the Death Valley Natural History Association, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, and the Nevada Geological Society; (3) development of research partnerships between two universities as part of collaborative research efforts, and the development of research infrastructure at each institution; and; (4) the investigators seek to engage the full participation of women and underrepresented students in STEM education through targeted recruiting efforts.<br/><br/>Reactivation and tectonic inheritance are long-recognized phenomena, important to our understanding of how the continental lithosphere deforms. The thesis of this proposal is that many Tertiary detachment faults and shear zones in the western US reactivate faults or sub-planar zones of earlier deformation. The Funeral Mountains metamorphic core complex of the Death Valley region represents an ideal locality in the Sevier-Laramide hinterland to evaluate the role of tectonic reactivation in the development of metamorphic core complexes, as well as to resolve important details regarding the tectonic history that predates Tertiary extension. We hypothesize that the Boundary Canyon detachment fault, which underwent greater than 40 kilometers of top-the northwest slip in the Miocene, formed as the last reactivation of a major Jurassic thrust of opposite slip that was responsible for deep burial and regional metamorphism of the footwall. We propose a multi-faceted approach to evaluate the hypothesis of protracted tectonic reactivation through detailed studies along the metamorphic and strain gradient that includes: (1) field mapping and structural analysis, (2) petrographic, microstructural, and kinematic analyses aided by Electron Backscatter Diffraction analysis of quartz-rich rocks, (3) applying petrochronology (Laser Ablation Split Stream Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) to date accessory minerals (metamorphic titanite, monazite, xenotime, and zircon overgrowths) and Lutetium-Hafnium dating of garnet in garnet amphibolites, and (4) determining the metamorphic conditions and prograde pressure-temperature paths to evaluate the prograde burial history, possible grade discordances across major shear zones, and the regional thrust-induced paleodip. Recognition of tectonic reactivation has important implications for understanding the older Jurassic and Cretaceous history of the Sevier-Laramide orogen, the magnitude and distribution of contraction and extension that occurred during orogenesis, and the episodic nature of post-orogenic extension."

The flexible glucose fuel cell enables a 20x increase in volumetric density with 320 uW of power available from a biocompatible 1cm (d) x 4 cm (l) device, which is implanted in the subarachnoid spaces of the brain and spinal cord. Thus, fully implantable brain implants for paralysis with novel state-of-the-art ultra-low-power electronics for neural recording, stimulation, decoding, and wireless communication, which consume 95 uW in total, can be powered with a safety factor of 3x that allows for fuel-cell output variation over time. This proposal attempts to test a fully functional brain-implant system in a smaller geometry 3 mm (d) x 3mm (l) device in a rat to ensure chronic (> 6 months) long-term biocompatibility and performance that meets our power budget. The use of the cerebrospinal fluid as a power source, which has a 200x lower protein count, and almost million-fold lower cell count, and only a 2x lower glucose content, provides a novel site for implantation significantly different from prior work in blood plasma or interstitial fluid. This novel intended site of implantation along with our use of materials and techniques that have been proven to increase biocompatibility, such as Nafion encapsulation, enhance longevity. The flexible glucose fuel cell will be fabricated using well-known semiconductor fabrication techniques on a silicon wafer enabling manufacturing scalability and ease of integration with electronics on the same wafer. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>This work combines innovations and knowledge from several disciplines to potentially create a paradigm-changing capability in the field of medical implants: 1) Prior enzyme-based glucose fuel cells have been plagued by enzyme-degradation issues that have led them to be inefficient after a few short-term months. Abiotic fuel cells are more suited for long-term chronic operation but have relatively low power outputs. The creation of an abiotic flexible glucose fuel cell increases the volumetric density of available power by more than an order of magnitude while preserving the benefits of long-term abiotic operation. 2) The use of ultra-low-power bioelectronics that achieves state-of-the-art performance in all aspects of a brain-implant system enables miniature glucose fuel cells to meet the power budget needed for intended medical applications with even a safety factor of 3x and to fit within tightly constrained body spaces. 3) The use of standard semiconductor fabrication techniques enables entire flexible medical implants with their own power source and electronics to be cheaply fabricated in a rolled-up geometry without sacrificing performance as in systems made with flexible organic electronics. 4) The glucose-rich cerebrospinal fluid is highly abiotic (free of cells) and highly protein free making it an ideal source for providing fuel while not causing electrode bio-fouling. This work could enable glucose fuel cells to become practical after four decades of research.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>Glucose fuel cells have use in the treatments of cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, epilepsy, deep brain disorders, and cancer tumor monitoring. Rolled-up ?sugar powered batteries? may be used in non-invasive wireless medical monitoring or in wearable and flexible electronic systems. The flexible glucose fuel cell can help solve a national challenge for non-toxic (unlike batteries), renewable, carbon-neutral, energy sources that are practical. The PI plans to introduce an in-vitro glucose-fuel-cell powered ECG as a project in his course in bioelectronics at MIT that has been taught for over 10 years at MIT The Research Team further plans to develop a module that will use microfluidic setup to monitor output protein concentrations in cells at the fuel-cell output voltages and introduce the platform to the do-it-yourself community at MIT through programs such as Lifelong Kindergarten and ?Science Saturday? at Lincoln Lab. The PI plans to recruit under-represented students from his active participation in the admissions programs of the Computational and Systems Biology, Biophysics, Synthetic Biology, and Bioelectrical endeavors at MIT. The investigators will participate in SEED (Saturday Engineering Enrichment and Discovery) Academy, which enrolls students from Boston, Cambridge, and Lawrence Public Schools; they will also work closely with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) to attract promising young women into biomedical and bioengineering research; and, they will work actively with the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP), which has traditionally included underrepresented students into research programs.

Fabricating patterns with sizes less than 10 nanometers (10 billionths of a meter, or about 10,000 times smaller than a human hair) is essential for the manufacturing of future integrated circuits with speeds and functionality far exceeding current capabilities, that could revolutionize computers, information storage, and clean energy devices. Biological applications such as rapid DNA sequencing also require such small dimensions. Although techniques have demonstrated this resolution, their integration into manufacturing is hampered by serious technical and/or economic issues. Previously, the researchers demonstrated a nanopantography method that could address these issues. In this process, patterns are formed on a substrate such as a silicon wafer by directing a beam of positive ions at the substrate. Ions are focused to write patterns at sizes as small as 3 nanometers simultaneously at billions of locations. The past research was limited by the fact that the focusing structure (an array of lenses that focus ions much as glass lenses focus light) had to be incorporated on the substrate, which resulted in low throughput. The new studies will solve this problem by allowing the lens array to be separate, so that it can be used on multiple substrates. This will enable many applications for advanced electronic devices that benefit all aspects of modern life, especially the energy and health industries, with clear societal benefits. This challenging project will lead to new knowledge and will advance education in this important area of science and technology.<br/><br/>The electrostatic microlenses were built on the substrate, using standard microelectronic manufacturing methods. Voltages applied to the lens array cause ion beamlets entering each of billions of microlenses to be focused on the substrate. Using nanopantography, arrays of 300 nm diameter electrostatic lenses create nano-patterns in Si with sizes as small as 3 nm. While nanopantography can form complex patterns with very high resolution, the technique relies on the fabrication of a microlens array on each substrate, adding complexity to the process. To address this issue, the PIs plan on separating the microlens array from the substrate, so that it can be reused for patterning of subsequent substrates. This involves the fabrication of a stencil mask, containing the microlens array, which will be placed on sequential substrates to demonstrate a print-and-repeat process. Following this approach will greatly improve throughput, making nanopantography a manufacturing-worthy process. Experimental work will be complemented by ion trajectory simulations to achieve best focus, as a function of gap between the stencil mask and the substrate, and plasma beam conditions. Molecular Dynamics simulations will be used to study nanofeature etching in graphene on SiO2 by O+ and O2+, with an emphasis on the effect of ion energy and mass on feature size. Quality control measures will be demonstrated for potential pilot line manufacturing. The work will demonstrate a massively parallel method to repeatedly write nanopatterns in 2-D materials (graphene and WS2) on a substrate with a better than the state-of-the-art resolution of 3 nm, using a reusable stencil mask lens array. Nano holes, dots, and ribbons formed in the 2D layers will be characterized for plasmonic and other optoelectronic properties. Nanodisks will be carved out of large area WS2 films. Micro-photoluminescence will be used to characterize their light emitting properties."

Metallic hydrogen (MH) has been predicted to be a room temperature superconductor, and may be metastable, that is, it remains metallic when the pressure is released. If metastable MH would be the most powerful rocket propellant known. There are two pathways to MH: at high pressure hydrogen can be heated above the melting line to a new phase, the plasma phase transition, or PPT, where in the liquid phase it dissociates to become an atomic metallic liquid. The second pathway is to pressurize along a quasi-isotherm until it dissociates and becomes atomic metallic. Ultrahigh pressures are produced in diamond anvil cells and must be extended to pressures ~5 megabar to produce the predicted phases. Techniques have been developed for processing diamonds to increase their useful range of pressure and temperature with hydrogen samples. Using pulsed lasers, samples of hydrogen in the megabar pressure range have been heated to temperatures of a few thousand Kelvin and a phase transition has been observed. Measurements will be made to show that this phase is metallic or the PPT. Recent quasi-isothermal experiments have revealed a new phase above ~2 megabar, but not metallic. Experiments to study hydrogen to much higher pressures, beyond those of the new phase will be carried out by postdoctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students in their educational development.<br/><br/>****Non-Technical Abstract****<br/>The most prevalent element in the universe is hydrogen; pure hydrogen is found on earth bound together as diatomic molecules, that liquefy and solidify at very low temperatures as a transparent molecular insulator. For over 75 years it has been speculated that when pressurized, the molecules would dissociate to form an atomic solid or liquid that is metallic, with spectacular properties. These include room temperature superconductivity, existence of a liquid at absolute zero of temperature and millions of atmospheres pressure, superfluidity. Moreover metallic hydrogen is predicted to be metastable, that is, it would remain in the metallic phase when pressure is released, just as diamond made from carbon at high pressure does not revert to graphite when pressure is released. If metastable, metallic hydrogen would be the most powerful rocket fuel known and would revolutionize rocketry. Using diamond anvil cells to generate high pressures and optical techniques of study the pressure range will be extended, aiming to achieve pressures up to 4 to 5 million atmospheres and heating samples with lasers to thousands of degrees. Success in this program, carried out by postdoctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students, and where possible high school students, will extend our knowledge and understanding of this simplest, but most complex atom in the periodic table of the elements."

The presenters, discussion leaders, poster presenters and other participants debate the state of the art and which problems are most deserving of the researchers in the field. The GRC format emphasizes equal parts presentation and discussion, with only 22 talks altogether and active leadership of the discussion, which maximizes the opportunities for young researchers to learn about new ideas and problems. The presenters and discussion leaders have been selected based on their leadership in their respective areas and for their capacity for thought-provoking lectures. We anticipate that the conference attendance is close to the maximum of 200, of which approximately 40 % are expected to be students and postdocs. Therefore the educational impact on young researchers is substantial. We expect about 10 % to be assistant professors i.e. academics at an early career stage. The technical topics include 3D printing of metals, image analysis and data science. The 3D printing of metals is a prime example of a new and potentially disruptive technology that also has the potential to open up new lines of research in physical metallurgy because of its novel processing characteristics. Therefore the technical impact of the meeting is likely to be high because of the unusual mix of topics.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The 2015 Gordon Research Conference on Physical Metallurgy examines the future of the discipline. Revolutionary new high-resolution experimental tools are emerging that permit multi-modal characterization in all three spatial dimensions as well as time. At the same time, theory is maturing and modeling/simulation methods to test it are advancing at a tremendous pace. These are tools that allow us to address a key issue, which is 'How to exploit materials for best effect'? Accordingly, the topics that are addressed in order to understand where the current frontiers in Physical Metallurgy lie include: nucleation of precipitation, dislocations, damage; deterministic versus statistical modeling, e.g. fatigue cracking; microstructural design on the 5-1000 nm size scale; studies and modeling of ductility - as a proxy for failure; science behind modern processing techniques (rapid prototyping, interface bonding, plasma sintering); designing metastable structures, e.g. metallic glasses, nanostructures, layered composites and coatings; advanced microscopy and image analysis; and additive manufacturing (3D printing). As is the tradition of the Gordon Research Conferences, the meeting is founded on several fundamental pillars, namely to explore the frontiers of the discipline, to foster debate on the future of Physical Metallurgy, to present unpublished and speculative work, and to engage world-class speakers. Junior researchers i.e. postdocs and students are encouraged to attend because a large fraction of the available time is devoted to discussion and debate. To emphasize this point, the time devoted to talks is roughly equal to the time for discussion and presenters are strongly encouraged to discuss current, unpublished work, based on strict rules that bar citation or quotation from the meeting. In summary, this meeting offers a unique opportunity to learn about new developments and trends in Physical Metallurgy."

The current proposal addresses the question the sky-spanning ""ribbon"" of unexpectedly intense emissions of ENAs detected by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission. By modeling the heliosphere using the resources of the Blue Waters facility at NCSA its becomes possible to analyze such puzzling astrophysical flows as those in the Guitar nebula, and compare modeling with remote observations. Numerical solution of these problems with the realistic boundary conditions provided by remote and in situ observations of the SW properties, requires the application of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technologies and petascale supercomputers.

Comprehending what led to supereruptions in the past is essential to understanding and predicting similar events in places where supereruptive activity is currently possible, including the U.S. (e.g. Yellowstone), South America, Indonesia, and New Zealand. This project will investigate an exemplary exposure of 18- to 19-million-year-old volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks in the southern Black Mountains of Arizona, where the geologic record documents magmatic evolution of the Peach Spring Tuff supereruption, which is the focus of this project. Students participating in the REU will address questions that are important to both the scientific community and the public: (1) How does supereruptive magmatism compare to typical-scale magmatism (e.g. Mount St. Helens in 1980), and how are these connected? (2) What does a supervolcano look like before it erupts? (3) What are the relationships between intrusive rocks and spatially and temporally associated volcanics? (4) How and why do large magmatic systems change through time? It will also provide a platform for testing and applying integrated field and analytical methods for tracking evolution of magma systems, including optical and scanning electron microscopy, rock and mineral analysis by X-ray fluorescence and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, GIS, and remote sensing, tools that can also be combined to address questions at other magmatic centers.<br/><br/>In addition to advancing the understanding of the magmatic systems that produce supervolcanoes and thereby enhancing comprehension and forecasting of future supereruptions, this project will provide a valuable introduction to research for 30 diverse undergraduates whose opportunities may be otherwise limited. It will contribute to the scientific literacy, problem solving and communication skills and the confidence of this group of students, thereby enhancing their general education, and it will attract future earth scientists to the field, providing them with a sound foundation to begin a graduate or professional career and enduring collegial relationships with peers and faculty. This project will foster new and continuing collaborations involving participating students, leaders, and researchers at other academic institutions. It will also provide valuable mentoring experience for two early-career faculty (one female) and one outstanding female PhD student, all of whom are pursuing careers emphasizing mentoring undergraduate researchers."

Applied optical technology is addressed with the unique, trillion watt peak power lasers in the research. These lasers generate some of the highest intensities of visible and ultraviolet light realized in the lab. The contribution to scientific knowledge comes about by addressing how intense light excites elements (e.g. lithium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen) and polymer hydrocarbons (e.g. methane, propane). Specifically, the research probes high energy electron dynamics and ion fragmentation in intense laser-matter interactions. Special attention is given to quantifying how many of the electrons most tightly bound to the nucleus are excited. The measurements are made possible by the investment in new scientific laboratory apparatus designed to probe highly accelerated (e.g. million volt) electrons and record the complex ion fragmentation. The theory effort uses large scale (supercomputer) trajectory ensembles to model excitation and relativistic effects in the interaction. The outcomes are relevant to disciplines including plasma physics, fusion energy, physical chemistry, atomic physics, and optical science. The research addresses efforts to develop new laser sources and attosecond science, which directly measure how electrons move in atoms and molecules.<br/><br/>The high field research in the award is pursued by the international community; students involved in this research are exposed to international efforts in optics and laser science.

This study is a plan to describe quantum dot fate in representative aquatic settings subjected to broad chemical conditions while exploring specific degradation mechanisms and environmental factors that influence these processes. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconducting nanocrystals with core/shell structures often less than 20 nm and employed in fluorescent measurements and energy applications, and, like other metallic nanoparticles studied over the past decade, may undergo physical (aggregation) and chemical (dissolution) transformations that influence their overall bioavailability upon release to receiving water bodies. While the toxicity of CdSe/ZnS QD and their leached metals have been examined closely for a variety of microorganisms, more mechanistic details of their degradation processes is needed for the various classes of QDs subjected to diverse aquatic chemistries in order to better predict their overall fate.<br/>The overall goal of this proposal is to determine how different types of QDs, both conventional and next-generation, degrade in aquatic environments and waste streams. Specific objectives are (1) to develop a robust, rapid analytical procedure for identifying and quantifying QD elements in their particulate, complexed, and dissolved forms with almost no sample pre-treatment using single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICPMS) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC-ICPMS), (2) to identify the ligand groups of various types of organic matter that promote QD degradation and element release, (3) to determine influence of UV and visible light in promoting QD degradation, (4) to evaluate other inorganic geochemistry factors such as dissolved hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfide that may influence QD degradation, and (5) to determine whether physicochemical properties of QD coatings can be altered to prevent QD degradation. Reaction rates and product distributions will be determined within batch reactors containing various combinations of QDs and geochemical constituents. The results will provide fundamental information on the roles of geochemical solution conditions, dissolved organic compounds, and UV and visible light exert on the dissolution of a variety of QDs. The SP-ICPMS developed here will have application to other metallic nanoparticle measurements in waters.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>The laboratory investigations into QD degradation processes will lead to a deeper understanding of QD longevity to be expected upon release into aquatic environments, and this information will lead to improved designs of QD coatings. This work will provide education for one graduate student per year and several undergraduate students in environmental engineering. The research opportunity provides diverse experimental and analytical instrumentation training in water quality, inorganic synthesis chemistry, and mineralogical techniques. Broadened participation of underrepresented groups will be addressed by providing experiential learning opportunities through hands-on laboratory engagement to undergraduate students, Massachusetts state teachers, and local high school students. Their research experiences will be integrated into the PI's Research Program by supporting QD synthesis, reaction, and characterization methods as well as the Educational Program by assisting development of educational materials for the instruction of broad audiences about the principles of environmental science and engineering. These materials are intended to foster systems thinking education using WWW-based multimedia modules comprised of graphical, video, and systems modeling tools. The results of this Educational Program will reach local middle school, high school, and undergraduate students through field trip demonstrations and curriculum modules."

Lipids are major building blocks of cellular membranes and a subclass of these biomolecules control cellular functions by attracting proteins to distinct cellular sites at specific times. Such lipid mediated signaling events require a high degree of organization in space and time, and deviations from the proper execution of these signaling pathways result in a wide array of cellular dysfunctions. The cellular requirements for the local accumulation of signaling lipids are only beginning to emerge and the mechanisms leading to the time dependent control of these lipid pools need to be determined. The research funded under this proposal will delineate the mechanisms that lead to the formation and maintenance of localized pools and gradients of signaling lipids. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in many modern research techniques, including single molecule microscopy. The principal investigator will continue to develop inquiry based middle school science projects and his research group will be involved in a range of STEM outreach activities. <br/><br/>The impact of the research will be to understand how phosphoinositides, which are minority components of plasma and intracellular membranes, provide spatiotemporal control of protein function. Phosphoinositide gradients have been observed in vivo, however, currently there is no experimental platform available that enables the testing of hypotheses about how these gradients are created and maintained. This grant supports the development of a microfluidic device that will be used to systematically investigate how phosphoinositide gradients are created through the action of phosphoinositide specific kinases and phosphatases and subsequently stabilized by other biomolecules."

Ionospheric scintillation refers to random fluctuations in amplitude and phase of radio signals traversing a region of turbulence in the ionosphere. It impacts the power and phase of the radio signal and is caused by small-scale (kilometer to centimeters) structure in the ionospheric electron density along the signal path. Ionospheric scintillation affects trans-ionospheric radio signals up to a few GHz in frequency and, thus, can have detrimental impacts on satellite-based communication and navigation systems, such as GPS-based systems, and also on scientific instruments requiring observations of trans-ionospheric radio signals, e.g. for radio astronomy. The physics behind the generation of the plasma irregularity structures that cause scintillation is not fully understood, largely due to a lack of adequate observations. An obvious consequence of this is that neither does a reliable capability exist for the prediction or mitigation of the effects of scintillations on radio waves. ISX will generate an extensive dataset for applying diffraction radio imaging, which enables the prediction of scintillations at any frequency determined from the imaged structure, and potentially the mitigation of distorted signals by canceling phase fluctuations. Another broader impact of the proposed project is that it is a pilot effort to provide global, space-based monitoring of ionospheric radio wave distortion using signals of opportunity available worldwide. While a single spacecraft cannot provide real-time monitoring, it can show the way for a constellation of spacecraft to provide such a space weather service in the future. Scintillation effects occur predominantly in the equatorial region in ionospheric density structures termed Equatorial Spread F (ESF). The main goal of this project is to provide new observations on the structure of scintillation-scale ionospheric irregularities associated with ESF. Specifically, ISX will simultaneously record scintillation patterns of multiple ground-based digital television (DTV) carrier signals. Scintillation patterns for a unique set of experimental geometries will be compared to determine how far along the magnetic field the turbulence maps, which is crucial observational data on the three-dimensional electrodynamics of these sub-km structures.<br/><br/>During the lifecycle of the project, it will provide extensive student training opportunities, including student involvement through Cal Poly spacecraft design classes and funded graduate students. Each year, 20-40 students will be involved in the design, fabrication, and flight of this mission. Cal Poly has flown many student satellite missions; the proposed effort will leverage the heritage and experience from all of these.<br/><br/>This project addresses the science question: To what distance along a flux tube does an irregularity of certain transverse-scale extend? It has been difficult to measure the magnetic field-alignment of scintillation-scale turbulent structures because of the difficulty of sampling a flux tube at multiple locations within a short time. This measurement is now possible due to the worldwide transition to DTV, which presents unique signals of opportunity for remote sensing of ionospheric irregularities from numerous vantage points. DTV spectra, in various formats, contain phase-stable, narrowband pilot carrier components that are transmitted simultaneously. A 4-channel radar receiver will simultaneously record up to 4 spatially separated transmissions from the ground. For most experimental geometries, the corresponding transmitter-satellite lines-of-sight will cross the same magnetic flux tube within 1-10 s, a reasonably short time to assume ""frozen"" irregularities. Correlations of amplitude and phase scintillation patterns corresponding to multiple points on the same flux tube will be a measure of the spatial extent of the structures along the magnetic field. A subset of geometries where two or more transmitters are aligned with the orbital path will be used to infer the temporal development of the structures. The radio receiver is based on the instrument developed and successfully demonstrated on the previous Radio Aurora eXplorer (RAX) NSF CubeSat project."

A commonly used approach for computing non-continuum flows is the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which can be thought of as providing a statistical representation of solutions of the Boltzmann equation by modeling the behavior of a large number of the molecules in the flow. This proposal is about a novel scheme to solve the Boltzmann equation numerically that has the potential to alleviate many of the limitations of DSMC, including feasibility for large scales. The proposed work is based on a new idea on how to compute the collisional integral, which appears in the Boltzmann equation and has been the reason for inefficient solutions and approximations to-date, using a projection into a discrete yet conservative velocity space. This approach can be viewed as a variation of DSMC that uses variable-mass fixed-velocity quasi-particles, rather than fixed-mass variable-velocity particles. Preliminary results show good agreement with theoretical predictions. The software developed during this project will be given to other academic and government laboratory users on request.

His work focuses on several aspects of string theory -- which unifies gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature (strong, weak, and electromagnetic). String theory has an unusual property - it contains something called ""holographic dualities"", which relate theories in many-body quantum systems (ranging from quark-gluon plasma to superconductors) to theories of gravity in higher dimensional spaces. These dualities, since they relate to very different systems, allow calculations in one system to give results in the other. Professor Kaplunovsky studies the duality between forms of super-dense nuclear matter and models with crystal-like structures, as well as the duality between models of gravity in highly curved spaces with strongly interacting particle physics models. He also studies string theories which are dual to each other. All these projects are deeply connected to other aspects of string theory as well as to particle physics, nuclear physics, and condensed matter. To enhance the broader impact of his research, Professor Kaplunovsky will give a series of talks to high-school students about hot issues of modern physics (which alas are not even mentioned in a regular curriculum). The subjects may involve fundamental particles, cosmology, or anything else the students may be interested in. Prof. Kaplunovsky will also give a series of more advanced lectures about theoretical physics to the undergraduate students at the University of Texas and at other universities in the US and overseas.<br/><br/>Prof. Kaplunovsky's research focuses on several issues of string theory and holographic QCD. One project is about infinite crystals of YM instantons -- which 'live' in 4+1 dimensions (where they act as particles) but may form lower-dimensional lattices in external potentials. There are many types of such crystals, with different lattice geometries and/or different patterns of instantons' isospin orientations. The project focuses on surveying such crystals and the phase transitions between them, especially the transitions which change the dimensionality of the lattice (3D->4D, or 2D->3D, or 1D->2D). Another project focuses on leading order (in alpha') stringy corrections to the hadron spectra in high-curvature holographic QCD models with O(1) 't Hooft couplings. A related issue concerns stringy corrections to the short-distance nuclear forces in models where the dual baryons looks like string stars rather than instantons. The third project is about M theory duals of the heterotic orbifolds, which seem to give paradoxical results, and he hopes to come up with a solution to these puzzles."

These PDE are used in programs to evolve given geometries toward ones which are in suitable senses ""optimal"" or ""canonical,"" and which are thus amenable to classification. But because these PDE generically develop singularities, a classification of those singular behaviors is necessary for the successful completion of those programs. Analyzing formation of (finite- or infinite-time) singularities is the unifying goal of this project. A key approach is the use of matched asymptotics, a technique that can provide the most precise description of the set of points on which a solution becomes singular, and of the behavior of the solution in a space-time neighborhood of that singularity. Major objectives of this proposal include: (1) removing symmetry hypotheses in asymptotic singularity analysis for mean curvature flow (MCF) and Ricci flow (RF), thereby proving that certain singularity profiles are ""universal"" in a rigorous sense; (2) constructing and analyzing (non-generic) Type-II RF singularities, which form more slowly than the natural parabolic rate and thus feature faster curvature blow-up; (3) constructing codimension-2 RF singularities and studying their asymptotics, genericity, and stability; (4) constructing and studying new examples of RF local singularity formation for complex surfaces (and complex manifolds of higher dimension) with applications to the classification of singularity models in those dimensions; (5) studying stability (properly understood) of product structures and related curvature conditions preserved by RF in low dimensions; (6) showing that singular profiles of geometric PDE depend continuously on their initial data, with applications to topology; and (7) studying formation and stability of infinite-time RF singularity models under distinct convergence schemes designed to provide asymptotics at temporal infinity, along with other geometric information.<br/><br/><br/>The theory of geometric partial differential equations (PDE) has surprising similarities with nonlinear hyperbolic and dispersive equations. Furthermore, the PDE that arise in curvature flows are remarkably similar to equations that model heat propagation, the movement of oil in shale and thin films, combustion in porous media, and certain effects in plasma physics. In all of these applications, the underlying models are fundamentally nonlinear, a property which causes the associated PDE to develop various critical or singular behaviors. The utility of these models requires a precise mathematical understanding of these behaviors. This project will further develop mathematical techniques, particularly matched asymptotic expansions, that should help the analysis of singularity formation in these varied systems and applications."

Because of their anticipated role in large-scale industrial production, there is little doubt that select NM will ultimately find their way into our aquatic environment. There is a lack of fundamental studies that have investigated the effects of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) biological interactions and effects in aquatic organisms, particularly through chronic dietary exposure routes, and even fewer that have addressed mechanisms of action. Therefore we have limited understanding of the potential toxicity associated with environmentally relevant exposures.<br/><br/>The purpose of this proposal is to fundamentally understand the sub-lethal effects of SWNTs with a focus on elucidating their role in limiting growth and reproduction in largemouth bass (LMB), a well characterized environmentally relevant freshwater model for reproductive toxicological assays. We are particularly interested in investigating the ability of pristine non-surface functionalized SWNTs to alter the gastrointestinal (GI) environment through direct tissue damage and/or sequestering proteins vital to digestion and absorption of dietary constituents. The study design involves a systematic top down approach spanning in vivo fish exposures to mechanistic in vitro assays. We will accomplish these studies through the following specific tasks; (1) Track SWNT distribution using a custom built near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging system and assess growth following dietary exposures to LMB; (2) Assess the impact of SWNTs and estrogen enriched diets on reproductive endpoints including measurements of vitellogenin and steroids (17&#946;-estradiol and 11-keto-testosterone) in plasma by ELISA and determination of estrogen receptor binding and activation using fluorescence polarization and gene reporter assays, respectively; (3) Determine suites of proteins bound to SWNTs in intestinal tissues and blood using proteomics strategies. The proposed research will fill a critical gap in the scientific literature by providing a systematic understanding of the growth and reproductive effects of ingested SWNTs. This will also be the first study to address specific mechanisms of action (MOA) by employing a suite of molecular assays and proteomic strategies. These studies will be fully novel, as there are no fundamental mechanistic reports that have examined the impact of SWNTs on growth and reproductive processes through disruption of the GI tract and endocrine system in fish. Results of this study may lead to biological relations for SWNTs in aquatic environments, allowing a priori predictions of their fate and effects and therefore meets the definition set forth by the NSF for transformative research.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The expected research outcomes and benefits include systemic tracking of SWNTs in whole animals; advanced understanding of chronic dietary exposures to SWNT on the endocrine system; revealing the interactions of SWNTs with biological molecules and specific MOA including receptor activation and cell production of steroids . This increase in basic scientific knowledge will ultimately lead to understanding relevant environmental exposure scenarios and sub-lethal biologic effects that could impact aquatic organisms at the population level. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The proposed activity will generate critical knowledge to better understand the environmental implication of a commercially important class of nanomaterials. The majority of requested funds are directed toward the training of a postdoctoral associate in an emerging and interdisciplinary research topic. This research will provides for mentoring and cross training (molecular signaling and proteomics) in a novel and highly relevant area that is of immediate and critical importance to our society. The postdoctoral training program integrates classroom and hands on laboratory training and the opportunity to mentor minority graduate and undergraduate students recruited to work in the lab. Dissemination of the research results is planned through conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications and research symposiums."

This research project aims at addressing this issue by developing discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods by the sparse grid approach. The resulting schemes enjoy the excellent properties that the traditional DG methods offer, while still being able to achieve high-order accuracy with a significant reduction in the required degrees of freedom. The research will have direct impact on the efficient and robust computations of kinetic equations and on other application areas involving high-dimensional PDEs. The research plan is complemented by educational and outreach activities involving the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, and fostering collaborations among female researchers in computational mathematics. <br/><br/>The research plan consists of several coherent projects, ranging from algorithm design, analysis, and implementation to application. In particular, the investigator plans to perform detailed studies of sparse tensor product polynomial spaces and to construct DG methods on sparse grids for model equations. The methods will be further developed for kinetic equations with attention to numerical challenges specific to Vlasov and Boltzmann equations. The PI will also develop similar numerical schemes for PDEs arising from areas such as optimal control and mathematical finance. Theoretical issues including stability, conservation, and error estimates, and computational issues including efficient linear solvers, adaptivity, and parallel implementations will be explored. The educational goals of this project are to develop a pipeline for the recruitment, retention, and early research exposure of undergraduate students, to continue integrated training and mentoring of graduate students and postdocs, and to promote collaborations and build a network of support for early career female researchers.

To achieve this outcome, the investigator will conduct field research at established sites with on-going ocean acidification research across a broad geographic range. The broadening participation activities involve education and outreach to Pacific islanders at the remote field sites where students will engage in hands on research activities.<br/><br/>Rising sea surface temperatures (SST) and ocean acidification (OA) threatens the ability of calcified organisms to build carbonate reefs. Current understanding of the effects of OA on coral reefs originates from static laboratory studies largely focused on growth of corals. But tropical crustose coralline algae (CCA) have been proclaimed as the ""canary on the coral reef"" because some species dissolve in these OA ""shock"" experiments. The exact physiological mechanism is unknown, but may be related to the magnesium content of the skeletal tissue, which renders the calcite more soluble in acidified conditions. The mole fraction of Mg in CCA in situ is subject to temperature and salinity and is positively correlated with warmer SST. This relationship has been exploited for climate reconstruction studies, but has not yet been considered in the context of OA. If CCA are not phenotypically plastic for Mg fractionation, then warming may exacerbate the response of these species to OA. The overall objective of this research is to examine the ecological importance of Mg content in recently deposited skeletal tissue of common, pantropical CCA across a wide latitudinal range that encompasses natural spatio-temporal gradients in carbonate saturation and SST. The project includes three specific objectives: 1) Describe the biogeographic and fine-scale patterns of Mg content in the carbonate skeleton of several species of common tropical CCA. 2) Explore the relationships of temperature and seawater carbonate chemistry with Mg content in several species of CCA. 3) Test whether Mg content alters the biological response (e.g. species-specific net calcification rates and community composition) of CCA to global warming and/or ocean acidification. Both powdered X-ray diffraction analysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry will be used to quantify Mg2+ content relative to Ca2+ in the calcite lattice of CCA skeletal tissue; growth increment patterns will pinpoint the timing of deposition. High frequency time-series seawater pH or pCO2, salinity, and SST data, complimented by discrete sampling for the remaining carbonate parameters (from established OA monitoring programs), will resolve daily, tidal, and seasonal cycles and be related with coincident biological data (calcification and production rates and Mg content) in situ."

Associated with the Arctic warming and waning sea-ice cover is a reorganization of the surface and deep-water circulation of the Arctic Ocean, but understanding of the associated processes is limited. The early to mid-Holocene provides a post-glacial analogue of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, similar to scenarios that have been proposed for the next several decades. This early-mid Holocene sea ice minimum, 10?6 thousand years ago, is often attributed to changes in solar forcing. However, records providing information on upper Arctic water column stratification during episodes of minimum sea ice cover are sparse. The normal paleoceanographic proxies for water mass stratification cannot be applied in the Arctic; different approaches are required to reconstruct water column hydrography. The proposed research has the potential to greatly improve our knowledge of past Arctic water column hydrography from the early to mid-Holocene sea ice minimum and inform scenario development of future conditions in the Arctic Ocean. <br/><br/>The project will contribute to workforce development through support for the training of a PhD student. The technology developed will be proactively transferred to the international science community through a formal workshop. <br/><br/>Recent innovations in the combined use of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (laser-ablation ICP-MS) and Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) have shown that a wealth of environmental information about water column stratification can be extracted from single shells of fossil foraminifera. Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) (Nps), grows its chambers (ontogenetic calcite) near the Arctic surface, and subsequently sinks through the water column where it adds a thick calcite crust around the thinly calcified chambers at sub-mixed layer depths. Thus, each individual Nps shell contains chemical and isotopic zonation from waters with distinctly different physical properties ? the generally cold low salinity surface mixed layer and warmer subsurface halocline. Intrashell variability can be measured with in situ analytical approaches. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to apply a multi-instrument approach to quantify intrashell geochemistry in Nps shells obtained from an array of boxcore samples across the Arctic Ocean. They plan to combine intrashell 18O and 13C measurements in <5 m-sized domains by SIMS with analyses of Mg/Ca (proxy for temperature), Ba/Ca (proxy for river runoff or meltwater discharge), and Na/Ca (proxy for salinity) by laser-ablation ICP-MS on the same Nps shells. The innovative SIMS ultra-small domain isotope analytical approach was developed within the last few years by PI Kozdon, and calibrated in the lab of PI Spero. Both SIMS (spot-measurements) and laser-ablation data (depth profiles through the calcite layers) can be correlated to well defined domains in the foraminiferal shells that reflect a specific stage in the specimens? ontogenetic development (?time-markers?). Each of the measurements can be assigned to a general water depth range that is related to the depth of calcite addition as Nps migrates through the water column during its ontogenetic development. Thus, the proposed analytical approach provides an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct past water column stratification between the surface and halocline from individual shells of Nps in sedimentary assemblages. This innovative multi-instrument approach will be applied to mid-Holocene and late Holocene Nps shells from ~50 14C-dated box-coretop samples from the Arctic Ocean. The cores will be carefully selected, mainly from U.S. core repositories, using the following criteria: (I) good coverage of the Arctic Ocean with a focus on key-areas sensitive to changes in water mass stratification and (II) existing 14C dates, although some of the cores will still need to be dated."

Direct high capacity connectivity between researchers, local research instruments, the computational resources of the IDRE Research Data Center and external national and international resources and collaborators is integral to the next generation of research at UCLA. The set of UCLA research projects enabled by this work includes: molecular biologists manipulating raw sequencing data; genetics researchers sharing and archiving large data sets; and physicists running plasma simulations some of the country's largest supercomputers.<br/><br/>This connectivity is achieved via a high performance 40/100 gigabit layer 2 switching infrastructure. High performance Layer 2 network connectivity allows researchers to take full direct advantage of the network?s capacity while pushing slower elements like routing and security to the larger Science DMZ edge, where it is available, but only when needed."

Under this model the seed electrons undergo further acceleration in the radiation belts. Recently some studies have questioned whether or not this seed population is necessary. In this view the electrons are locally accelerated in the radiation belts. This proposal will investigate whether or not a seed population is necessary. The investigators will examine the phase space density of electrons as a function of radial distance by using observations from the THEMIS satellites, the Van Allen Probes, SWARM (an ESA mission) and e-POP (a Canadian mission). This will be a statistical study that uses a number of events.<br/><br/>The PI has long involved secondary school students in his research.

On the one hand, the physical relevance and the validity of these ideal models are established through the comparison between the results from theoretical analysis and the experimental observations. On the other hand, once the meaningfulness of a mathematical model is supported by available experimental data to certain extent, the theoretical studies on these ideal models can provide properties of the original physical problems that are hard to be obtained through experiments. For physical systems involving temporal evolution, of particular interests are those structural and asymptotic properties. These include some special structures, such as steady states, periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, chaotic orbits etc, and their qualitative properties like stability etc. In general, on the one hand, only stable states are physically observable in a system, while the ideal, but unstable, states are hardly observed due to their extremely sensitive dependence on the parameters. On the other hand, unstable states are also very important, partly due to the fact that they and some of their associated structures serve as the boundaries separating different collections of stable states in a system. In this project, the PI plans to focus on the local dynamics near steady states in several classical nonlinear partial differential equation systems, which all belong to the general category of nonlinear waves. The lack of a priori damping and the complicated nonlinearity pose most of the challenges in their mathematical analysis. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI proposes to study rigorously the local dynamics of the following partial differential equation systems. The first one is the incompressible Euler equation, which models non-viscous and incompressible fluids like water. The proposed problems include fluids in rigid containers and fluids with free surfaces like ocean waves. The second partial differential equation in the proposal is the Vlasov-Poisson system that models the collisionless plasma, which consists of particles with both velocity and electrical charge. The third one is the quasi-linear waves equation. Even though there have been extensive research on these systems and many important progresses have been made in recent year, due to their very nonlinear nature, many issues including some fundamental ones are still not well understood after years of efforts. The PI plans to focus on their local dynamic structures near equillibria, including stability/instability, local invariant manifolds, special solutions and bifurcations. While these aspects are standard notions in the theory of smooth dynamical systems, due to the highly nonlinear nature of these partial differential equations, their solution maps often do not have sufficient smoothness in phase spaces for the classical theory to apply directly. In contrast to ordinary differential equations, the relationship between the qualitative structures and the regularity analysis of these nonlinear partial differential equations is an essential analytical aspect of nonlinear partial differential equation dynamics. Solving and understanding these problems, expected to be largely based on their specific mechanical and geometric structures, would result in substantial theoretical advances in these areas and possibly lead to the discovery of new physical and mathematical phenomena in the corresponding systems."

These include many important equations in classical field theory and continuum mechanics; e.g. Einstein's equations of general relativity and Euler's equations of fluids. The basic questions concern existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions, as well as the question if solutions blow up (e.g. black holes in general relativity) and if not what the long time behavior of solutions are? More specifically, the PI is mainly working in two areas. One project is to study if Einstein's and related equations have solutions for all times or if the solutions blow up. A long term goal is to study the stability of large solutions like black holes and the big bang in general relativity. The motivation is to understand the large scale structure of our universe. The Physicists are building large gravitational wave detectors to observe the universe and the theory has to be developed together with observations. Another project is to study a class of problems that occur in fluid dynamics and general relativity, in particular, proving existence and stability for the free boundary problem of the motion of the surface of a fluid in vacuum (such as the surface of the ocean). A long term goal is to study the long time behavior of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars as well as other interface problems of fluids and solids. It is conceivable that understanding the properties of and controlling the interface between two fluids could have important applications. In particular there is a version of the problem in magneto-hydrodynamics and controlling the plasma is needed for constructing fusion reactors.<br/><br/>To solve these problems the PI and collaborators are developing new techniques that could be useful for studying many other problems as well. In particular, they are using geometric methods combined with frequency decomposition methods to study hyperbolic differential equations. The PI's and collaborator's greatly simplified existence proof for Einstein's equations and its generalizations and refinements will have a large impact. Moreover the detailed asymptotic behavior they prove in harmonic coordinates will be useful also for the physics community. The methods the PI has developed for the free boundary problem of fluids work also for the compressible case and also with vorticity since it uses interior equations and not just equations on the boundary. The methods PI and collaborators are developing to deal with nonlinear equations with variable coefficients will hopefully also be useful to show stability of perturbations of large solutions."

The fundamental knowledge acquired will impact the ceramics processing field by shedding light on a controversial topic (electric field effects on ceramics), and at the same time including fundamental advancements in the Li-ion battery field.

The model materials of choice for this study are a sodium superionic conductor (Nasicon) ceramic, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAG) (an electrolyte material with high ionic conductivity), and lithium vanadium phosphate (Li3V2(PO4)3) (LVP) (a material that can serve both as a cathode and as an anode). Battery performance and reliability are closely related to the presence of inhomogeneities and microstructural defects in the component materials. This project first focuses on the development and application of an experimentally validated microstructural and porosity evolution spark plasma sintering (SPS) phase field sintering model. Next, the experimental design is using these modeling results to verify the influence of electric field in terms of sintering, vacancy migration, tortuosity, microstructural inhomogeneity and porosity evolution in the model systems (LVP, LAG, and LVP/LAG). The third step of the research uses advanced simulation models to include thermal and electric field contributions, as well as pressure and rapid heating regimes to the growth phenomena during SPS processing of the model materials. Finally, the previous results are used to set up an experimental model to include actual SPS sintering regimes that contain the integrated SPS sintering experimental parameters (electric field, temperature, heating rate, and pressure) towards processing of samples with controlled porosity and minimal tortuosity."

This research project aims to develop improved numerical methods for simulation of these systems. Progress in designing robust and more efficient high order methods will significantly impact on simulation technology for such applications. <br/><br/>The state of high order accurate numerical methods is still far from being practically satisfactory for time-dependent nonlinear problems. Compared to their low order counterparts, high order methods are much harder to stabilize and might be less efficient in practice due to much larger computer memory cost. Thus it remains challenging to utilize a high order accurate method to solve nonlinear hydrodynamics equations in real world problems. The objective of this proposal is to address these real-world problem challenges from specific perspectives. First of all, one would like to ensure the robustness of Eulerian schemes by preserving certain invariances of physical quantities such as positivity. Second, one would like to design more efficient implementations of very high order schemes on curved elements for complex geometries."

Drought triggers osmotic-stress signaling events in plants, which regulate the gene expression network and subsequent physiological and developmental processes, reducing water loss. Among these signaling events, the initial perception for osmotic stress is poorly understood at the gene level. The project is designed to identify and study the genes encoding sensors for drought/water as well as their regulatory components in plants. In this project, the identification and examination of the gene family of water sensors will not only further our understanding of how plants sense water, but also provide potential genetic targets for engineering drought resistant plants, such as crops, grasses and trees.<br/><br/>It is well established for over the last 20 years that osmotic stress evokes a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which is thought to be involved in osmosensing. However, the molecular nature of the corresponding osmosensing components remains largely unknown. Using aequorin Ca2+ imaging-based unbiased forward genetic screens, Arabidopsis mutants defective in osmotic stress-induced [Ca2+]i increases (oici) were previously isolated, and one gene, OSCA1, was identified as the founding member of a functionally novel and evolutionarily conserved family of channel proteins. OSCA1 forms hyperosmolality-gated, non-selective cation channels with Ca2+ permeability in the plasma membrane. Suppression of OSCA1 results in attenuated osmotic signaling in stomatal movements and root growth, suggesting that OSCA1 functions as an osmosensor in plants. In this project, the detailed biophysical properties of OSCA1 channels will be determined (Aim 1). Then, 14 other OSCA1 homologs will be screened for their osmosensing activities (Aim 2), and their physiological functions in drought stress and root hydrotropism will be assessed (Aim 3). Finally, novel osmosensing-related components will be isolated via fine-mapping of additional oici mutants (Aim 4). This project will establish the Ca2+-mediated sensory machinery by which plants perceive water availability in both external environments and internal tissues."

Migratory birds are excellent model systems for investigating such integrative questions because migratory birds are impressive endurance athletes that use primarily fats to fuel their flights, and diet strongly influences fatty acid composition of stored fat that in turn affects whole-animal energetics during exercise. Reliance on fatty acid oxidation to fuel high-intensity endurance exercise in birds is remarkable in part because it increases oxidative stress which must be dealt with by the bird's antioxidant defense system. In fact, human health requires a ready supply of dietary antioxidants to combat the free radicals produced as part of normal metabolism, and much contemporary medical research is focused on understanding how dietary antioxidants promote human health. The primary goals of the two proposed research projects are to experimentally determine how certain essential fatty acids stimulate fat metabolism in exercising birds, how the antioxidant defense system of birds responds to the increased oxidative stress associated with exercise, and how this interaction between fat metabolism and antioxidant defenses depends on changes in seasonal demands during fall and spring migration. <br/><br/>The proposed research builds on the successful collaborative research and teaching programs at a primarily undergraduate (Sacred Heart University) and R1 research (University of Rhode Island) institution. The proposed research will allow URI graduate students to learn fatty acid analysis at SHU, and SHU undergraduates will help URI researchers with field work, captive bird studies, and laboratory analyses for measuring plasma metabolites as indicators of health in wild birds. The two PIs will continue their tradition of training undergraduate and graduate students by utilizing URI's enhancing diversity initiatives and SHU's collaborative with the inner-city Bridgeport (CT) public school system. The proposed research will also strengthen established collaborations with biologists in southern New England working for NGOs such as The Nature Conservancy, Audubon, and local land trusts as well as international collaborations (jointly supported by NSF International Science and Engineering (ISE) Section) with colleagues at the Advance Facility for Avian Research, University of Western Ontario, and Max Plank Institute for Ornithology, Germany. Currently, there is much public interest in dietary antioxidants and how they promote human health. Migratory birds offer an interesting model system for studying the role of dietary antioxidants and fats on fat metabolism during exercise because birds have relatively low rates of free radical production in spite of higher metabolic rates and much higher maximum longevity than mammals of similar body size. In addition, patterns of bird migration have been implicated in the dispersal of disease (e.g. avian flu) and migratory bird populations are declining due to the loss of suitable habitat for stopover sites during their migration. The PIs longstanding collaborative field studies in southern New England guarantees the results will continue to be used for land conservation and management efforts."

Electrically conducting fluids arise in applications including astrophysics, geophysics, plasma confinement, controlled thermonuclear fusion, liquid-metal cooling of nuclear reactors, electromagnetic casting of metals, ion thrusters for low orbiting satellites, magnetohydrodynamic drive for ships and submarines, microfluidic devices, and molecular biology. The fluid motion of the Earth's core maintains the terrestrial magnetic field, the solar magnetic field generates sunspots and solar flares, and the galactic magnetic field influences the formation of stars from interstellar clouds. These applications require substantially better modeling and simulation capabilities than presently exist. Problems without a clear scale separation, such as turbulence, are still at the frontier of multiscale modeling and simulation. When the fluid is electrically conducting, the turbulent fluid motions are accompanied by magnetic fluctuations. For Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, numerical simulations play a greater role than they play for hydrodynamic turbulence, since laboratory experiments are practically impossible and astrophysical systems (solar-wind turbulence, the most important system of high-Reynolds-number MHD accessible to in situ measurements) are too complex to be comparable with theoretical results. This research project will develop improved computational methods for these important problems.<br/><br/>This research project studies mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient methods to analyze direct and inverse problems constrained by MHD models. This includes the numerical analysis of computational algorithms, implicit explicit time-stepping schemes using the Elsasser variables, post processing via time-filters, spatial linear and nonlinear filters, spectral filtering, development of spatial filters specific to MHD turbulence, optimal control, and parameter estimation. Another objective of this project is to investigate the mathematical properties of several models for the simulation of the large eddies in turbulent viscous, incompressible, electrically conducting flows and new numerical models that permit long-time simulations, by time-splitting. The project has a broad impact for training undergraduate and graduate students in analytical and numerical aspects of magnetohydrodynamics, turbulence, and inverse problems."

The approach is based on the so-called micro-macro formulation of the kinetic equation, which involves a natural decomposition of the problem into equilibrium and non-equilibrium parts. The high order spatial accuracy is achieved by a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element approach, and the high order temporal accuracy is achieved by globally stiffly accurate implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. Due to deliberate design and considerations of the hydrodynamic asymptotics, the scheme under development becomes a DG method with explicit RK time discretizations for the Euler system in the zero limit of the Knudsen number, and a local DG discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations for a simplified BGK collision operator in a formal asymptotic analysis. Such a local DG method is similar in spirit to classical approaches based on a mixed formulation of the equations. The new scheme will be tested on problems at kinetic-hydrodynamic scales and compared with the results from the simplified BGK model, its ellipsoidal statistical (ES-BGK) extension, as well as with results from the macroscopic hydrodynamic models. The project will also study numerically the boundary layer for kinetic simulations when a diffusive hydrodynamic limit is considered."

The proposed research revolves in particular around three classes of problems. The first concerns the question of stability of flat interfaces for the irrotational free boundary Euler equations describing the motion of water waves. The second pertains to the study of the asymptotic behavior for nonlinear systems of mixed hyperbolic/dispersive type, such as the Maxwell-Schroedinger, Klein-Gordon-Zakharov, and Wave-Schroedinger systems. The third is related to singular limits over long intervals of time for point wise decaying solutions of some nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs. The PI's general aim is to prove, under certain conditions, global existence of solutions evolving from small Cauchy data. Furthermore, he aims to characterize the behavior of solutions at infinity and, in particular, answer the question of scattering, determining whether the global solutions constructed behave or not like linear ones for large times. A central theme of the proposed research will be the identification of the mechanisms determining at highest order the global regularity of solutions and the stability of certain equilibria. The PI expects some of the questions addressed to have highly non-trivial answers regarding the qualitative behavior of solutions for large times.<br/><br/>The equations under consideration describe a variety of physical phenomena such as fluid flows, quantum mechanics and plasma turbulence. Their relevance is widely recognized and supported by numerical and experimental evidence. Understanding the quantitative and qualitative properties of solutions, and their behavior over long periods of time, would be of importance for several research areas in the theoretical and applied sciences. For example, proving global-in-time stability of water waves models will improve our understanding of the motion of waves, such as those generated offshore on the surface of the deep ocean. It would also be relevant to numerical investigations and experiments aiming to understand how rogue waves are generated from apparently calm waters. Establishing mathematically rigorous stability results in some specific regimes would rule out some of their possible causes. Furthermore, proving that certain specific nonlinear asymptotic behaviors can occur in some of the equations considered, would reveal deeper connections with other fundamental models such as the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, which is ubiquitous in many branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering. The PI believes that solving the proposed problems would require substantial extensions of the current analytical methods, which may result in significant technical improvements of interest for the mathematics community at large. Finally, beyond pursuing his own projects, the PI will also be actively engaged in the dissemination of his research and will strongly promote collaborations among different groups within the international PDE community and researchers in related areas."

These data will be used to interpret preserved sedimentary signatures contained within cores whose record extends into the last century, the period for which relatively robust instrumental records of discharge, climate, and oceanographic conditions exist. Ultimately, it is hoped the results of this research will allow high-resolution characterization of climatic drivers over the last several millennia. This knowledge will further understanding of how this system has responded in the past, and may provide crucial predictive information concerning future climate variations. Additionally, a key outreach component for this study is the development of a teaching curriculum to be used by underserved populations within rural Alaska who have limited access to science education or current research. The program will aim to further student understanding of how scientists use sediment cores to identify climate trends in PWS and the northern Pacific Ocean, and the subsequent impact on fisheries distribution, subsistence, and commercial harvests. This project will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Steven A. Kuehl at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.<br/><br/>The PWS is a sensitive sub-arctic region where rapidly changing climate patterns strongly alter hydrological and oceanographic conditions in ways that have profound ecological and economical implications. This research seeks to exploit the potential for a high-resolution environmental record contained within PWS sediment, which may allow us to understand changing river sediment dispersal and/or climate-driven oceanographic patterns throughout the Holocene. Previous X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyses reveal that PWS sediment cores contain geochemical and sedimentological signatures that can potentially resolve varying source input. Elemental ratios (e.g. Sr/Mn, Zn/S, K/Ca) may provide a basis for differentiating Chugach/northern PWS derived sediment loads from those of the upper Copper River. However, there is a paucity of information on compositional variations within the major drainage basins, and understanding seasonal variability influenced by changing provenance/ freshwater sources (e.g., snow melt, glacial melt, and rainfall, Chugach vs. Wrangell Range) in Copper River discharge is critical for the development of environmental proxy records. Once constrained, these proxies have the potential to resolve climatic oscillations on sub-annual to decadal timescales. Therefore, this project focuses on collecting a high-resolution time-series of representative samples of PWS and Copper River basin sediments with the aim to confidently constrain elemental variations observed in sediment core XRF records. Elemental composition of suspended sediment concentrations will be determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS). Samples will also be analyzed for cosmogenic 7Be to test the hypothesis that the ubiquitously used tracer for recent fluvial sedimentation may be problematic in high latitude settings during spring discharge/ glacial melt."

However the formula is only a very basic starting point for understanding how the reactions occur and, therefore, how to control them. Dr. Kandel is investigating the molecular changes, or mechanisms, of chemical reactions taking place at solid surfaces to shead light on how these reactions actually take place at the atomic scale. He is particularly interested in determining the effect of compositional impurities and atomic-level structure on the rate and the products of a reaction. In some cases, these changes are desired, such as the enhanced catalytic activity demonstrated by specific defects in many processes of industrial importance. In others, such as the preparation techniques used to create computer chips and other semiconductor devices, even a small number of imperfections in a surface can result in an unusable product. Dr. Kandel employs an imaging technique known as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to ""see"" individual atoms and molecules in order to determine how the solid surfaces change at the atomic level during the course of a chemical reaction. These experiments produce time-lapsed sequences that show how the particular local composition and geometry influence and control both the rate and the outcome of a chemical reaction. The fundamental understanding gained in this project helps the future design of new catalysts, surface coatings, and materials processing methods.

For example, collapse may occur when a powerful laser beam enters a transparent medium, such as usual glass. Interaction of the medium with the laser beam results in self-focusing when the intense light creates an effective lens inside the medium and amplifies itself during propagation until the singularity of the light amplitude is reached. Mathematically a singularity means that the corresponding mathematical solution approaches infinity. Qualitatively similar collapse phenomena occur in hydrodynamics as well as in the bacterial growth (for example, for E. Coli). In the latter case, communications between bacteria (through a chemical substance called chemoattractant) cause spontaneous aggregation of the bacterial colony to a very high (almost singular) bacterial density. Solutions of the corresponding nonlinear systems of partial differential equations that model phenomena with collapse experience spontaneous formation of singularities in finite time (blow-up). Blow-up is often accompanied by a dramatic contraction of the spatial extent of a solution, hence the term ""collapse."" Near the singularity point there is a qualitative change in underlying nonlinear phenomena; the initial mathematical models lose their applicability and other mechanisms become more important, such as optical breakdown and formation of plasma in optical media, or bacterial crowding and formation of multicellular organisms from the bacterial colony.<br/><br/>This research will focus on phenomena of collapse in the Nonlinear Schrdinger equation (NLSE), Keller-Segel equation (KSE) and Davey-Stewartson equation (DSE) which are archetypal equations to study finite time singularities in the critical dimension two. These equations are among most universal and widespread equations in nonlinear science with numerous applications in nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics and biology. The need in understanding collapse became especially pressing since the advent of lasers in early 60s. More than 50 years of research produced well-established collapse theories for NLSE and KSE. However, until recently it remained a puzzle why these theoretical results were never confirmed by either direct simulations or in experiments. The explanation is that the existing theories required unrealistically large amplitudes for their applicability. This project will develop a detailed theory of collapse scaling and collapse regularization in NLSE and KSE for the realistic amplitudes. The principal investigator will also develop a DSE collapse scaling theory, which has been lacking for many years. The effort will be made to make the theory a practical tool for applications. Both perturbative and nonperturbative approaches will be used, as well as matched asymptotic techniques and extensive supercomputing. Diverse applications of NLSE, KSE and DSE will promote cross-fertilization of ideas across the fields of nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, Bose-Einstein condensation and biology."

Associated with the Arctic warming and waning sea-ice cover is a reorganization of the surface and deep-water circulation of the Arctic Ocean, but understanding of the associated processes is limited. The early to mid-Holocene provides a post-glacial analogue of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, similar to scenarios that have been proposed for the next several decades. This early-mid Holocene sea ice minimum, 10?6 thousand years ago, is often attributed to changes in solar forcing. However, records providing information on upper Arctic water column stratification during episodes of minimum sea ice cover are sparse. The normal paleoceanographic proxies for water mass stratification cannot be applied in the Arctic; different approaches are required to reconstruct water column hydrography. The proposed research has the potential to greatly improve our knowledge of past Arctic water column hydrography from the early to mid-Holocene sea ice minimum and inform scenario development of future conditions in the Arctic Ocean. <br/><br/>The project will contribute to workforce development through support for the training of a PhD student. The technology developed will be proactively transferred to the international science community through a formal workshop. <br/><br/>Recent innovations in the combined use of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (laser-ablation ICP-MS) and Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) have shown that a wealth of environmental information about water column stratification can be extracted from single shells of fossil foraminifera. Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) (Nps), grows its chambers (ontogenetic calcite) near the Arctic surface, and subsequently sinks through the water column where it adds a thick calcite crust around the thinly calcified chambers at sub-mixed layer depths. Thus, each individual Nps shell contains chemical and isotopic zonation from waters with distinctly different physical properties ? the generally cold low salinity surface mixed layer and warmer subsurface halocline. Intrashell variability can be measured with in situ analytical approaches. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to apply a multi-instrument approach to quantify intrashell geochemistry in Nps shells obtained from an array of boxcore samples across the Arctic Ocean. They plan to combine intrashell 18O and 13C measurements in <5 m-sized domains by SIMS with analyses of Mg/Ca (proxy for temperature), Ba/Ca (proxy for river runoff or meltwater discharge), and Na/Ca (proxy for salinity) by laser-ablation ICP-MS on the same Nps shells. The innovative SIMS ultra-small domain isotope analytical approach was developed within the last few years by PI Kozdon, and calibrated in the lab of PI Spero. Both SIMS (spot-measurements) and laser-ablation data (depth profiles through the calcite layers) can be correlated to well defined domains in the foraminiferal shells that reflect a specific stage in the specimens? ontogenetic development (?time-markers?). Each of the measurements can be assigned to a general water depth range that is related to the depth of calcite addition as Nps migrates through the water column during its ontogenetic development. Thus, the proposed analytical approach provides an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct past water column stratification between the surface and halocline from individual shells of Nps in sedimentary assemblages. This innovative multi-instrument approach will be applied to mid-Holocene and late Holocene Nps shells from ~50 14C-dated box-coretop samples from the Arctic Ocean. The cores will be carefully selected, mainly from U.S. core repositories, using the following criteria: (I) good coverage of the Arctic Ocean with a focus on key-areas sensitive to changes in water mass stratification and (II) existing 14C dates, although some of the cores will still need to be dated."

The new numerical tools developed under this project will provide scientists with a better understanding of theoretically unresolved issues on the mathematical properties of solutions to KdV type equations. Furthermore, the proposed project will provide accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the simulation of nonlinear dispersive wave propagation in various applications. These proposed research topics will have a positive impact across the mathematical sciences and have significant applications in many scientific areas that rely on the study of non-linear phenomena. This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students and focus on involving student from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. By working on the project, the students will benefit from novel ideas for new algorithm design, approaches for rigorous mathematical analysis, and advanced skills in implementation.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to devise and analyze the first superconvergent hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods and hybridized mixed methods for solving the KdV equations and their multidimensional generalizations. The proposed project includes a comprehensive coverage of new algorithm design that is backed up by solid analysis and made practical by efficient implementation. The P.I. proposes to carry out a detailed study of superconvergent HDG methods and hybridized mixed methods for KdV type problems in the following steps: First, the P.I. will develop novel HDG methods and hybridized mixed methods for stationary third-order linear equations, focusing on the discretization of the third-order differential operator. Superconvergence properties of the approximations will be computationally and analytically investigated. Second, the P.I. would like to solve the third-order KdV equations by using implicit schemes for time discretization to avoid extremely small time steps and developing new HDG methods and hybridized mixed methods for spatial discretization. Error analysis will be carried out, and superconvergence and conservativity properties will be studied. Third, the P.I. plans to extend these superconvergent methods to multidimensional KdV type equations such as the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, and the hybridization technique will make the methods efficiently implementable in multiple dimensions."

In the first system, the PI considers a nonlocal, integral model for non-Fickian (or anomalous) diffusion. The model has as special cases fractional Laplacian and fractional derivative models but generalizes these models in several ways such as allowing for spatial heterogeneity and anisotropy, less smooth solution behavior, and a simple means for treating problems posed on bounded domains. The project addresses several issues that are crucial to the efficient, robust, and accurate approximation of the nonlocal diffusion model. In particular, the effects of truncating kernels and data so that computations can be done on finite domains are analyzed, combined finite element/domain and data truncation error estimates are obtained, and a goal oriented, adjoint equation-based grid adaptation methodology is developed, analyzed, and tested. In the second system, the PI considers the nonlocal, spatial derivative free peridynamics model for solid mechanics. The model allows for discontinuous solutions so it is especially well suited for modeling defects. As such, its efficacy has been demonstrated in several sophisticated applications, including the fracture and failure of composites, crack instability, fracture of polycrystals, and nanofiber networks. The project involves the development of a computational methodology that takes full advantage of the multiscale properties inherent in peridynamics and which results from the phenomenological horizon parameter that limits the extent of interactions. In the third system, both the Vlasov-Poisson and cold-ion systems for modeling the expansion of ions from high to low-density regions are considered. The project includes the development of a new cold-ion model that remains valid beyond the time of singularity creation, showing that solutions of the new model remain the limit (as the ion temperature tends to zero) of solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system, studying analytically and computationally the transition that occurs as the density ratio decreases from solutions having no singularities to ones that do, treating problems with multiple species of ions, and developing efficient numerical methods for two and three-dimensional settings.<br/><br/>The project addresses fundamental issues that arise in the mathematical and computational treatment of three physical systems that are of huge importance in a wide variety of applications. These include but are not limited to the nucleation and propagation of defects, (cracks, delaminations, etc.) in solid bodies (airplane wings, nuclear reactor containment vessels, etc.); anomalous diffusive behavior observed in subsurface water, oil, and gas flows, in animal foraging behaviors, in polymeric flows, in exotic materials, etc.; and in ionized flows in lasers, space propulsion systems, supernovae, etc. Obtaining useful information about such complex systems requires massive computational efforts which can be greatly aided by improvements in mathematical models, qualitative theoretical information about solutions of those models, and, most of all, by better, more efficient and more accurate computational algorithms. Because of the wide-ranging settings that the project impacts, the results obtained will be of great interest to scientists, engineers, and policy makers involved in, among other things, the theoretical study of physical phenomena, in the design and manufacture of new devices, and in the assessment of risks and design of remediations."

A new high-power, high-frequency transmitter at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico offers opportunities to study ionospheric plasmas in a carefully controlled way. This award is for the development of a six-element medium and high-frequency (MF/HF, 0.3 to 30 MHz) imaging radio array. There will be three primary uses of the array: (1) Imaging and spectral and temporal study of radio emissions generated within the relatively narrow beam (about 10-deg full width) of the new Arecibo Observatory transmitter during ionospheric radio wave interaction experiments (heating campaigns); (2) Oblique-angle radio emission observations and multiple bistatic radar observations with an HF radar in Cayey, Puerto Rico; and (3) Direction-finding radio emission observations and radar imaging studies of the ionosphere within the wide transmitter beam of the HF radar in Cayey. Arecibo Observatory HF campaigns are anticipated to be twice a year for about two weeks each, so imaging with multi-kilometer-scale spacings would be done then, using temporary field sites. 20-km to 100-km spacings would also be done using temporary field sites, at least initially. At other times the array would be located at a permanent site at the Interamerican University campus in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, where 10-m to 300-m antenna spacings would be used. The 12-km array (array 1) would image the structure of stimulated radio emissions (SEE) from the HF interaction region with the goal of determining the exact geometries of the source regions of the many SEE spectral features with respect to the geomagnetic field. The array would also show whether or not the polarization of SEE varies between spectral features. Radio images of the geometric and polarization properties of the emissions promise to reveal new details of the physics of the emissions. The Bayamon and Aguadilla campuses of Interamerican University of Puerto Rico are private, primarily undergraduate institutions with nearly all Hispanic, mostly low-income students. The instruments to be developed would enhance the overall capabilities of the atmospheric, space, and radio research infrastructure at Interamerican, including the ongoing development of a graduate program emphasizing atmospheric and space research."

Thus, the main goal of the project is to provide an improved understanding of MHD turbulence, in general, seeding the future application of the project results to other space plasmas.

The third-moment theory of the turbulence in the solar wind provides a tool, which is highly model-independent and can serve as benchmark for modelers. The investigators will continue to expand their research in this area by including wind tunnel data, the anisotropy of the energy-cascade, turbulence between 0.3 and 1 AU, intermittent structures, shear flows, turbulence in downstream shock regions, and expansion effects. The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the nature of turbulence in space and astrophysical plasmas. Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of the space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.

One important topic is to understand the formation and persistence of coherent structures observed in experiments and in nature. Some examples include the large vortex structures in the atmosphere and ocean, the traveling wave patterns in ocean waves, and the observed galaxy structures. Another topic is to understand and control the instability in many applications. One such example is to control the instability of plasmas in fusion devices to achieve the goal of controlled nuclear fusion for energy production. Methods of mathematical analysis are the primary tools employed in the proposed investigations.

The techniques are mainly analytical as opposed to numerical. Self-force effects on a point mass orbiting near a rapidly spinning black hole will be computed and used to inform astrophysical source modeling as well as thought experiments testing the cosmic censorship conjecture. Equations for the self-force will be formulated in alternative gauges and alternative gravitational theories. New force-free solutions will be found by exploiting spacetime methods and developing new perturbative techniques, with an overall goal of developing a broad understanding of force-free electrodynamics and its application to electromagnetic energy extraction from astrophysical black holes. The project will contribute to the training of Ph.D. students, and the research results will be disseminated to the public through research publications as well as news articles and public lectures where appropriate."

The bowl is turned off to release the ultra-cold atoms into a high vacuum and they are imaged during expansion by laser flash-photography. By just turning a knob in these tabletop experiments, an expanding atom cloud can be made to simulate the behavior of electrons in superconductors, neutrons in neutron stars, or even an exotic state of matter that existed just microseconds after the Big Bang. The study of these nearly perfect fluids has practical significance in testing theories of high temperature superconductors, which will one day enable energy-saving power transmission, and fundamental significance in testing theories of perfect fluid flow that may have occurred just after the Big Bang. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to measure precisely the nearly perfect hydrodynamic transport properties of an ultra-cold atomic Fermi gas. Spin-up and spin-down atoms are made to strongly interact by means of a bias magnetic field, tuned near a collisional (Feshbach) resonance. A collision between two such clouds produces shock waves as the strongly-interacting clouds bounce off each other. Measurements of the shear viscosity above, at, and below resonance will enable new tests of the lower bound predicted for a perfect fluid using string theory methods. Studies of scale-invariant flow at resonance will determine the bulk viscosity and test general predictions for scale invariant systems. The experiments cross interdisciplinary boundaries by testing state-of-the-art theory for the transport properties of strongly-correlated matter, which can be simulated in these cold atom experiments, such as high-temperature superconductors, nuclear matter, and quark-gluon plasmas that are created in heavy ion collisions."

This project aims to extend current theoretical understanding of this important class of equations. Training of junior researchers and students in this area of research is also an integrated part of the project.<br/><br/>The problems to be investigated are nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations with broken symmetries and/or non-constant coefficients. While some of these equations are very physical, such as the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrodinger equation with non-zero boundary conditions, others have been carefully selected by the investigator to highlight certain deficiencies in our mathematical understanding of the underlying linear propagator. A major thrust of this project is therefore to resolve questions in harmonic analysis related to the linear propagator in various geometries. These range from proving Strichartz estimates powerful enough to resolve the small data energy-critical problem on high-dimensional tori to shepherding recent progress on the restriction conjecture into the realm of non-constant coefficients, which is a key step toward resolving mass-critical problems outside the translation-invariant setting."

Recent observational and theoretical work has shown that whistler-mode waves can propagate obliquely with respect to the ambient magnetic field, so a multidimensional approach is required. The simulations will be run on a next-generation computational platform that will allow the inclusion of realistic parameters for the radiation belt region and will be used in close coordination with observed wave and particle data to study the growth, amplitudes, and wave propagation characteristics of whistler waves and for chorus waves, the formation of their structured spectra, and the general effects whistlers have on electrons in terms of energization and pitch angle scattering.<br/><br/>Whistler waves, which are ubiquitous in the radiation belt region, play a major role in the transport, acceleration and loss of electrons.

Understanding the role waves play in the formation of relativistic electron populations in the radiation belt region is key to space weather studies because of the deleterious effects these electrons can have on satellites.

The overall goals of this experimental program are threefold: i) exploit high sensitivity direct absorption IR laser methods for study of fundamental jet cooled molecular ions, clusters and molecular ion clusters in slit supersonic discharge expansions, ii) develop and implement novel spectroscopic tools for quantum state-resolved collision studies at gas-ionic solution and gas-liquid microjet interfaces, and iii) utilize the powerful combination of time resolved fluorescence microscopy and laser ""nanobathtub"" heating methods for fundamental chemical physics studies of temperature and viscosity dependent RNA folding/unfolding at the single molecule level.<br/><br/>The way molecules interact to form a liquid or a solid is generally driven by relatively weak forces, which can be studied in detail by laser spectroscopy of small clusters of these species. In a similar vein, these spectroscopic tools can also be extended to probe the interactions of molecules colliding at the gas-liquid interface, specifically investigating with what probability they dissolve in the top liquid layer and how often they simply ""bounce"" back into the gas phase. In a very real sense, these studies permit one to interrogate the chemical composition of the molecules at the gas-liquid interface. Finally, we have built instruments that can focus laser pulses in a microscope lens down to a small enough spot size to illuminate a single fluorescent label (i.e., the Donor) in a doubly labeled RNA biomolecule with a second fluorescent label (i.e., the Acceptor). By monitoring the color, time, and polarization of the light that gets reemitted, we can learn about the proximity of the two dye labels, which allows us to watch in real time (i.e., msec to sec to minutes), for example, the kinetics for forming double stranded DNA from single strands, or the folding of a single protein into a competent, enzymatically active structure. This work will enable the training of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced areas of chemical physics (e.g., quantum optics, lasers, plasmas, and electronics), while furthering the discovery of fundamental new research knowledge. The results of these studies will provide opportunities for student participation in national professional meetings, outreach through scientific open houses, mentoring with the local high schools, as well as operation of the ""CU Wizards"" Science Outreach Program for elementary and middle school students."

The broad scientific importance of terahertz technology is attested by the number of research programs and publications working to develop terahertz metrology techniques for a broad range of applications, including medical imaging, organic and polymer material science, and study of chiral molecules, amino acids and metamaterials. In particular, polarimetric methods will contribute to an understanding of physical interaction mechanisms and device physics in a range of applications. Our effort includes support for active dissemination of polarimetric capability to the broader research community. Moreover, this project is structured so as to enhance undergraduate and graduate research opportunities at the University of Washington, by providing training to student instrumentalists in terahertz polarimetric methods. Additionally, experimental results and research findings through this project will be disseminated in the form of guest lectures in a graduate-level course in Photonics. Finally, throughout this project, we will endeavor to identify and recruit female, disabled and under-represented minority students, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. <br/><br/>Polarization measurement and ellipsometry are essential research techniques for investigating properties of new materials in many areas of basic sciences, which also find immediate industrial and biomedical applications. Broadband polarization measurement in the terahertz frequency regime presently suffers from several significant limitations: (1) Current terahertz polarimetry techniques offer only coarse polarization resolution and small isolation between orthogonal polarization channels, due in significant part to (2) poor ability to calibrate THz polarimeters, as a results of high frequency-dependent power loss in external polarizers; moreover (3) current terahertz polarimetry techniques require rotation of external polarizers to pre-determined fixed angles and positions, which burdens the system with lower measurement speed and inaccuracies in rotational polarizer placement.<br/>We propose development of a novel broadband terahertz polarimeter that combines two recent advancements in terahertz source and detector technology: A. Coherent control of complex polarizations of terahertz waves generated in gas plasmas, and B. Measurement of sample-induced ellipticity and cross-polarization using a novel full polarimetric broadband terahertz spectroscopy setup. Integrating these two techniques, we will demonstrate a polarization-agile terahertz polarimetry system capable of investigating cross-polarization and chirality of a wide variety of natural and manufactured targets. We will in particular demonstrate applications of the new polarimeter in two important applications, namely diagnosis of healthy and burned mammalian skin tissue and characterization of photonic devices based on graphene and nano-stuctured materials."

This strategy will be extended to the treatment of double ionization involving inner shells as well as diatomic molecules. Of particular interest will be the highly challenging, but ultimately necessary simultaneous treatment of the nuclear and electronic motion.

Nonetheless, problems in which the boundary conditions play a crucial role still pose significant challenges. This project is aimed at undertaking a wide-ranging investigation of initial-boundary value problems for integrable NLEEs, both continuous and discrete, in both one and two spatial dimensions, including their applications in several concrete scientific and technological settings. This study will be carried out by developing and using exact methods, such as the inverse scattering transform and direct methods, in combination with appropriate asymptotic and numerical techniques. Specific problems that are being studied include: (i) nonlinear Schrodinger systems (scalar and vector, continuous and discrete) with non-zero boundary conditions at space infinity; (ii) boundary value problems for discrete and continuous NLEEs; (iii) characterization of soliton interactions for all of the above systems; (iv) classification of solitary wave structures in (2+1)-dimensional integrable systems such as the Davey-Stewartson system.<br/><br/>Nonlinear wave equations are well-known to model a variety of physically interesting phenomena arising in areas ranging from fluid dynamics and nonlinear optics, to plasmas, cosmology and quantum field theory. The study of these equations is especially attractive because it offers a unique combination of interesting mathematics and concrete physical/technological applications. In particular, the systems that will be studied in this project model wave propagation in water waves, optical fibers, lasers and Bose-Einstein condensates. Hence the outcomes of this project will not only advance our mathematical understanding, but they will also provide practical information that will help scientists and engineers. The training of undergraduate and graduate students is also an integral component of this project. One of the PIs has co-authored a monograph on NLS systems that has been referenced extensively and is helping the dissemination of knowledge in the field of nonlinear waves. Both PIs have a long record of working with both graduate and undergraduate students, and will work both with undergraduate students and with Ph.D. students as part of this project."

(1) The first goal is to further advance the work concerning cloaking-by-mapping. Particular emphasis will be placed on the physical relevance of the proposed meta-materials (used for the cloak), and on the potential for improvement in the relative cloaking rates of the approximate schemes. In the context of physical relevance, the goal is to study meta- materials that satify the socalled Kramers-Kronig relations (which naturally emerge from causality considerations). Initially these studies will focus on materials, which are governed by the socalled Drude-Lorentz model. It is also planned to perform a careful study of the similarities between the technique of perfectly matched layers (PML) and cloaking-by-mapping. (2) The second goal is to better estimate the presence of inhomogeneities, in particular their volume fraction, from the response to multiple boundary loads. The aim is to extend earlier low volume fraction results, obtained for small number of boundary measurements (n measurements in n dimensions). (3) The third goal is to study the uniqueness and stability of an inverse problem, in which one seeks to identify a (nonlinear) current flux from a single (Neumann) boundary measurement. The associated boundary value problem is motivated by the equations of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria. (4) The fourth and final goal is to study static and dynamic problems associated with corrosion and oxidation modelling. These studies will range from the construction of explicit solutions, to the study of boundary blow-up, and criteria for finite time blow-up vs. existence for all time.<br/><br/><br/>There are significant possibilities for broader impact. In the area of ""cloaking-by-mapping"", the kind of results, one can expect to obtain, will be extremely useful in determining the degree of ""near invisibility"" that is in practice achievable, given (physically relevant) limitations on the meta-materials, used to construct the cloaks. One can well imagine an interplay between the type of results expected, and the actual physical construction of approximate invisibility cloaks. The work on the estimation/detection of small inhomogeneities has already led to the development of algorithms of use in flaw detection and medical imaging. The improved bounds, for volume fractions, will have similar potential applications. While the studies of the identifiability of the electric flux in the context of magnetohydrodynamics will be mostly theoretical, it is clear that the study of stability properties, and of the benefits of using additional line-integral measurements, could have very practical applications in terms of the control of plasmas in Tokamak devices."

One objective is to broaden the scope of experimental investigations by utilizing the wavelength scaling of the strong field interaction at frequencies lower than the intrinsic electron motion. Various aspects of the strong field interaction have an implicit wavelength-dependence that is a crucial scaling parameter and has not been explored or exploited in a systematic fashion. Addressing these scaling laws with ionization experiments using ultra-short pulses in the mid-infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum is crucial since it tests the very foundations of all our understanding of the intense laser-atom interaction. A second objective is to understand and connect the behavior of atoms in intense x-ray fields with the more studied optical regime. These investigations are enabled by the new generation of hard x-ray freeelectron lasers being constructed worldwide. The first of these devices, which became operational in 2009, is the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Laboratory. Using the unprecedented x-ray intensities available at the LCLS, this program will explore the strong-field high frequency regime. Scaling laws suggest that the behavior at x-ray frequencies will have significant fundamental differences with the optical regime.<br/><br/>The interaction of an isolated atom with an intense electromagnetic field is the basis for one of the forefront problems in atomic, molecular and optical physics. The ability to couple large amounts of energy into an atom by the absorption of many photons posed many intriguing questions and has led to many new discoveries. At the core of the problem is the extreme nonlinear response of the atom to a laser pulse that imposes an external electric field comparable to the forces binding the electrons to the nucleus. The continuing interest in this fundamental atomic physics problem is derived from its broad implications in other areas of physics and technology. The single atom response is the initial condition of more complex phenomena found in plasmas, inertial confined fusion concepts, advance particle acceleration and astrophysics. The intense laser-atom interaction itself is opening new opportunities in short wavelength science, quantum control and advancing an emerging discipline in hyperfast electron physics, attophysics and molecular imaging. The novel long wavelength laser sources developed by this project have broad applications in science, national defense and technology. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this research coupled with state-of-the-art ultra-fast optical engineering provides a fertile training ground for both undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, the LCLS XFEL has provided an exceptional educational opportunity for NSF supported students and a valuable resource for preparing the next generation of physicist trained in a frontier of ultra-fast x-ray science. Former group members are contributing to various areas of science and technology in academia, national laboratories and the private sector."

As such, dispersive partial differential equations can describe phenomena in optics, fluids, or plasmas, to name just a few areas of application. To determine the validity of a particular equation as a model for a given phenomenon, it can be helpful to determine whether the equation has a solution, and if it does, how this solution depends upon the physical parameters. For certain nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and for certain equations which can be used as models for waves in water, the principal investigator will study when these equations either lack solutions, or have solutions which depend discontinuously upon the data. This will indicate that these particular models have only limited validity for applications. As another part of the project, for some other families of dispersive partial differential equations, the principal investigator will determine when the equations either do or do not possess solutions with certain special forms. Understanding such solutions, such as waves of permanent form or time-periodic waves, can lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the corresponding physical phenomena over long intervals of time.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study well-posedness and ill-posedness for quasilinear Schrodinger equations and for truncated series water wave models. For quasilinear Schrodinger equations, well-posedness theorems have been proved under certain non-degeneracy hypotheses; in this work, ill-posedness will be studied when the non-degeneracy condition is violated. For truncated series models of water waves, the relationship between well-posedness/ill-posedness and the strength of dispersion will be investigated using complex variable methods and tools from paradifferential calculus. For nonlinear Schrodinger equations and for general families of nonlinear dispersive equations, the principal investigator will use small divisor estimates, normal forms, and dispersive smoothing estimates to demonstrate the non-existence of small-amplitude spatially periodic, time-periodic waves in certain parameter regimes. Also, existence of time-periodic, spatially-periodic waves for dispersive equations with high-derivative nonlinearities (especially for systems related to capillary waves in fluids) will be studied, using small divisor methods and techniques of Fourier analysis."

A complete understanding of the universe is summarized in the ""standard model"" of particle physics. In this model the fundamental bits of matter interact through gauge fields which are generalizations of electricity and magnetism. Some of these interactions, the ""weak"" force, possess the curious feature that they only affect the left-handed parts of matter. A mathematically natural way for this handedness to arise is for matter to be trapped on a surface embedded in some higher dimensional space. This notion sounds as if it belongs in a science fiction story, but in recent years quite down-to-earth studies have shown that certain crystalline insulators containing heavy elements behave in exactly this way. These ""topological insulators"" are only insulators on their insides. On their surfaces, electrons are free to move and conduct electricity, but they do so in a manner that forms a precise analogue of the way that quarks interact. These conducting states are of great interest, partly for practical reasons in building new generations of solid-state electronic devices that might lead to quantum computers, but also because the analogy with particle physics allows exploration of speculative particle physics at a much lower cost than building large accelerators.

Modeling and simulation will be based on data obtained by accurate crystallographic calculations, taking into account atomistic corrections, the presence of rough media, etc. Many of the techniques to be developed are pertinent also to exciting new applications in biological and social sciences. They include modeling of self-organized flows in ""particle"" swarms like birds or fish, emerging consensus in population dynamics, multi-agent information transfer, and social information dynamics in Internet, to name a few.<br/><br/>These research goals comprise a broad program in the development of analytical and numerical tools associated with statistical transport equations at the core of applied mathematics in probability, statistics, and physics. They concern the modeling of complex interactions systems yielding kinetic frameworks associated to Markovian processes of birth-death dynamics. Such statistical approaches lead to nonlinear integro-differential systems of equations of collisional Boltzmann or Smolukowski type. Many of these models appear in the collisional theory of semi-classical transport for short and long range interactions models that describe self-consistent phenomena at nano and mesoscales. More recently, collisional of birth-death processes have been appearing in the modeling of self organized swarm flows in social interactions and flocking dynamics, formation of networks, and queuing in supply chains. New tools from non-linear analysis as well as new computational strategies will be developed to address long time behavior, stability and decay rates to stationary modes, as well as qualitative behavior of numerical solutions and optimal computational strategies."

Compressible flows, in which the theory of sound is included, exhibit discontinuous wave profiles; examples include shock waves, contact discontinuities, moving material interfaces, moving vacuum boundaries, entropy waves, and a variety of additional discontinuous wave patterns. The analysis of such multi-dimensional wave patterns, and in particular, solutions of the Euler equations which propagate at least one surface of discontinuity, is fundamental to the understanding of basic physical phenomena. The goal of this research effort is to treat such multi-dimensional discontinuous wave profiles as moving free-boundary problems, and to develop a theory for the well-posedness of hyperbolic and degenerate hyperbolic systems, construct solutions which exhibit finite-time singularities wherein the propagating hypersurfaces collide with one another, study singular asymptotic limits such as vanishing viscosity limits and limits of zero surface tension, and develop a novel nonlinear stability theory for so-called hyperbolic-parabolic problems which are ubiquitous in models of phase transition.<br/><br/>Multiphase fluid flows with moving interfaces play a central role in a multitude of physical and engineering applications, ranging from the creation of hurricanes due to wind blowing on top of the ocean surface to the atomization of liquid fuel jets in combustion chambers to the motion of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars, and to fundamental predictions in atmospheric science and meteorology. The analytical understanding gained in this work may have important ramifications in the understanding of basic physical phenomena, which is heretofore, poorly understood. In addition to basic wave motion and singularities that occurs in the motion of interfaces between water and air, other conventional examples include the interface between air and water, the motion of cloud fronts, the melting of ice-bergs, basic instabilities between two compressed gases, the behavior of a gas bubble in a liquid in a shock wave, and liquid fuels which are usually burned by first atomizing a fuel jet to increase the surface area and hence the evaporation rate. This proposed research aims to analyze the motion of evolving surfaces of discontinuity in gases, liquids, plasmas, as well as in the context of classical phase transition models."

From the radiation physics perspective, an advantage of lasers is their ability to generate unprecedentedly short (attosecond) pulses of ultraviolet and x-ray radiation. Even though the spatial scales are drastically different, the physics of emission by electrons in large-scale synchrotron facilities (major research tools for x-ray crystallography and materials science research) and by electrons undergoing acceleration at the surface of a solid under the influence of extreme-intensity light fields are, in an essential way, the same. The interaction of intense, ultrashort-pulsed light with solids results in target ionization and the momentary formation of something akin to a nanometer-sized ""synchrotron"" (the charged particles emit bursts of high-energy radiation within time intervals much shorter than the half-cycle of the driving light field). This process can be controlled by the details of how the incident light field waveforms evolve with time. Taming synchrotron-type electron trajectories in solids by specially prepared laser fields, and ensuring that the result is the emission of intense ultraviolet and x-ray radiation is the aim of this program.<br/><br/>This program will explore the chance to enhance the intensity of coherent ultraviolet and x-ray emission from solids under extreme light fields by sub-cycle shaping of the driving laser pulse waveforms. The waveform shaping can be achieved through mixing the laser fundamental frequency with its second harmonic or higher frequency components. The effect of the energy distribution of different colors in the driving field as well as the phase delay between them on the radiation spectra will be studied. The program will seek the optimized solutions for driving waveforms, as well as the physical limits on the efficiency of the process. This study may provide new insight into the dynamics of field-controlled electron oscillations in laser-produced solid-density plasmas. Ultimately, this approach may offer higher attosecond pulse intensities than those currently achieved, opening a pathway to advance ultrafast metrology toward time-resolved x-ray pump-probe spectroscopy."

Silicon, in contrast, is an abundant nontoxic element that can be readily synthesized into luminescent nanocrystals in nonthermal plasmas. Like all quantum dots, silicon nanocrystals have limited photoluminescent stability. Motivated by preliminary data that demonstrate a clear link between nanoparticle packing and ensemble photostability, we will perform a combined experimental and computational study of the influence of particle size distribution, particle packing order, and local environment on the photostability of films and clusters assembled from purified silicon quantum dots. The plasma-synthesized nanocrystals will be (i) dispersed in organic solvents using ligands of varied length, (ii) separated by size in a scalable fashion through density-gradient ultracentrifugation into highly monodisperse fractions, and (iii) assembled into ordered films and clusters through controlled drying. Correlations between packing density, crystalline order, local environment, and photostability will be established by independently measuring the microstructure with optical and electron microscopy while simultaneously measuring the time-dependent spectral response. To interpret these experiments, we will combine numerical simulations of non-equilibrium self-assembly in drying colloidal suspensions with a quantum-mechanical model that accounts for the influence of inter-particle interactions on the photophysics of closely packed nanoparticle ensembles.<br/><br/>This project represents the first comprehensive scientific study of the influence of particle interactions on the photostability of silicon quantum dots, and it will have significant impact on a number of diverse fronts. The striking visual signal of photoluminescence is a particularly accessible manifestation of nanotechnology at macroscopic scales, and we will exploit this to engage the public, including high school students from across the state of North Dakota. We also have a strong record of mentoring undergraduates, including women and underrepresented minorities, through challenging projects that culminate in high-impact publications. A significant portion of the preliminary data in this proposal were collected and analyzed by undergraduates. Motivated by the interdisciplinary scope of the research, the PI is also developing a new graduate course specifically designed to train doctoral researchers at the ?soft-hard? interface, which represents a paradigm for nanotechnology in the 21st century. Finally, the potential technological impact of the knowledge gained is tremendously broad, ranging from efficient solid-state lighting and solution-processed photovoltaics to fiber-optic cryothermometers and stable non-toxic fluorophores for live cell diagnostics."

Recently, there has also been an increasing awareness of the importance of electron-molecule interactions in biological systems. For example, low-energy electrons seem to have a significant effect in driving DNA strand breaks due to the passage of ionizing radiation through biological material. Given the prominence of electron-molecule interactions in many environments, it is imperative that we understand how electron interactions drive chemical processes, particularly those that lead to bond breaking in molecules, as the remaining fragments often serve as progenitors to chemical reactions and reaction chains. It is also important to understand how energy flows into and out of molecular systems. It is this energy flow that governs the dynamics of any electron-molecule interaction. Given advancements in modern computational resources, theoretical models are poised to address electron interactions with more complex systems, that is, those of more that two or three atoms. However it is difficult to assign any level of confidence to the outcomes of these models due to the sparsity of experimental measurements to benchmark against. This project will measure the bond breaking and molecular dynamics driven in electron interactions with several complex molecular systems, for example, hydrocarbons, alcohols, and simple organic molecules, to serve as experimental benchmarks to theoretical models.<br/><br/>The interactions of electrons with the complex systems above reveal information about the structure and dynamics when driven to non-equilibrium states. By exploring both high- and low-energy electron interactions, with these complex systems, we can ascertain a more in-depth understanding of the physics driving the correlated dynamics. This project brings the application of the momentum fragment imaging apparatus at Auburn University to the study of correlated dynamics in electron-molecule interactions. The momentum imaging technique measures the full three-dimensional momentum of dissociation fragment ions as a result of electron interaction. This allows for a complete study of dissociation dynamics as a function of both electron energy and interaction angle with respect to a bond axis. It also allows for a measurement of the energy partitioning between translational and internal ro-vibrational energy of dissociating fragment ions. At low electron energies, dissociative electron attachment (DEA) is dependent on the incidence angles of electrons, with respect to particular bond axes, and selectivity of bond cleavage can be realized. Recent results for DEA show that complex stretching and bending dynamics, beyond a quasi-diatomic representation, must be accounted for to adequately explain the dissociation dynamics of triatomic systems. This project will extend previous work by transitioning to more complex systems, as mentioned above, that have seen little or no previous experimental attention. At higher electron energies, the structure and dynamics of select diatomic and triatomic systems driven into highly excited and ionic states will also be probed via momentum imaging of ions formed by the dissociative ionization and ion-pair processes. At both the low- and high-energy regimes, these various processes exhibit constant energy transfer. It is this constant energy transfer that allows for the specific determination of states involved in these processes."

Specifically, the excellent numerical properties of a B-spline basis allow for high computational accuracy, and the ability to employ non-orthogonal sets of term-dependent orbitals allows for compact configuration expansions. During the current funding period, the existing computer code will be fully parallelized, and a new suite of general atomic structure codes will be developed, which directly use the B-spline as an improved interface to the BSR collision codes. Furthermore, a parallelized B-spline code to solve the close-coupling equations in the outer region will be developed, and a pilot version of the BSR program to treat time-dependent processes, such as intense short-pulse XUV laser-atom interactions, will be extended to double ionization and infrared radiation. Finally, the potential use of the BSR method to describe electron and photon interactions with diatomic molecules will be investigated.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project consists of the further development of a highly successful suite of computer programs to calculate accurate atomic data for a wide variety of electron- and photon-driven processes.

The instrument (spectrometer) will have capabilities beyond those commercially available and will allow scientists to measure the temperature of large bursts of positronium atoms as a function of time.

The individual detectors will have time and double-pulse resolutions much less than the ~100 ns annihilation lifetime of positronium, enabling the efficient measurement of the temperature and thermalization rates of large bursts of positronium atoms as a function of time after their formation in micro-cavities and porous materials. The primary function of the proposed instrument will be to measure the amplitude of the low momentum component of a dense positronium gas as it undergoes a phase transition into the Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) state. The use of the penetrating annihilation gamma radiation as a diagnostic allows external access to the momentum profiles of annihilating electron-positron pairs deep within the apparatus required for these experiments. The measurements will be unaffected by local conditions in the positronium-forming target, such as wall or inter-particle interactions, which would not be the case for optical spectroscopy. The combined capabilities of the proposed spectrometer will benefit other positronium applications using dense cold positronium not related to the BEC. In particular, measuring the thermalization rates of positronium would aid in the positronium characterization of porous materials such as zeolites and low-k dielectrics, and the ability to measure low momentum annihilations at short time scales may be useful for evaluating damage to materials used in fusion reactors."
